Members of the National Assembly for Wales are worried they'll be called muppets
Some members of the National Assembly were alarmed by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea was born out of plans to rename the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP expressed concern about his group, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words twp and pwp.
For readers outside Wales: the Welsh word twp means fool, and the Welsh word pwp goose.
One Plaid Cymru politician said his group was unhappy with the proposal and offered other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was open to a name change, but noted that the word MWP sounded very similar to muppet.
In this case the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The committee working within the assembly, which is currently working on a draft name change bill, took the following position: Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will be their own.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the name change to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
The Committee also supported the proposal to change the title of Members of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament's Member, the WMP in English, although the abbreviation 'WWMP' was the most popular word in the public.
The members of the Assembly are proposing alternative solutions, and the difficulties in reaching consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the speaker of the Assembly, who is due to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will also take into account other changes to the Assembly's working methods, including the rules for the dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the debate of the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is to help end decades of dispute with neighboring Greece, which includes the region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian president, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, the plebiscite supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, maintain that the change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in New York City's St. Martin's Church are silent about the problems affecting churches in Harlem.
"The older people I talk to say that once upon a time there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Michael Henry Adams.
There's no sign of them now.
Like he says, the bar disappearance is understandable.
"People are now socializing in a different way", he noted.
'Bars have ceased to be a regular meeting place for members of the community.
He is concerned that the church's assets will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers think they will be, and that sooner or later they will find a starting point.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said, "The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, which will accelerate the complete closure of churches because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes".
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The first white Methodist congregation left the neighborhood in the 1930s.
The African American Assembly then took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors on 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem) opposed to hiring or promoting African Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell tower.
The great David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the call of the poor".
The expert who broke the bells in July described them differently as: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillon to feature black music, with Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, a series of complex events have taken place at St. Martin's Church, involving architects and contractors, some of them brought to the scene by lay church leaders and some by the dioceses of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a parish governing body composed of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, saying it wanted to move costs to the council, although the council did not participate in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark wounded a 13-year-old diver in California looking for lobsters
Authorities reported that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diving boy in California looking for lobsters last Saturday, the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he was diving for about half an hour with friends when he heard a cry for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the baby was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
When Chad Hammel arrived at the scene, he noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his elbow.
I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water, "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was listed as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescue captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but was not considered a threatened species.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
For security reasons, the authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, although most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to expand its presence in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is launching a chain of stores including Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, with supermarkets offering stylish cosmetics for department stores and specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market  which is worth £2.8 billion and is continuing to grow despite declines in the fashion and household goods industry  11 retail stores in the network will have larger racks of cosmetics.
The return to the cosmetics industry is the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 items, with products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw coming in for the first time.
The LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees brands currently on sale will also receive more seats and separate areas close to those well-known Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its boutique makeup product offering, and from now on most items will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly sought after by younger customers.
In addition to this, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will set up test points at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the other will be set up in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small quantities of food in local shops means that supermarkets need to encourage customers to visit more.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's CEO, said retail outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight discounts like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and products other than food.
Sainsburys has put Argos's points of sale in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat points since it acquired both companies two years ago, which it says will help boost sales of groceries and increase investment returns.
The previous attempt to reorganize the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries has failed.
In the early 21st century, Sainsbury's established a joint venture with Boots, but the partnership was terminated following a dispute over the revenue sharing of pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m three years ago.
Lloyds will reportedly contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to its four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of the cosmetics department to improve customer experience.
We've invested in special training for our employees to help consumers shop.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and a friendly environment and convenient location allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products and to challenge current shopping practices.
Peter Jones was furious when Holly Willoughby pulled out of his £11m contract.
Peter Jones, the star of the television show Dragons Den, was furious when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to withdraw from the £11 million lifestyle brand to focus on her new partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of accessories and household items called Truly.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand several times.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced her departure via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on her newfound collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den.
Sources say Peter Jones was furious when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that due to new contracts worth up to £1.5m he would not have time to devote himself to their brand of Truly accessories and household items.
The company was previously linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was also set to double Holly Willoughby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
After Holly Willoughby, 37, announced her decision to leave the Truly brand on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK to go to one of his summer homes.
As the source reports, the Truly brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She was bound to her future and wanted to be in it for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw the company was a complete surprise to all parties involved.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday.
There's a lot of stuff in the Marlow Store that's ready to sell.
Experts believe that the resignation of This Morning's host and one of the UK's most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds, given the significant investment in products  ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and household items  and could further delay entry into the market.
It may also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp co-founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them as president in March.
Couples spent their holidays together, and Jones owned a 40% stake in a television production company owned by Dan Baldwin.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S's brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night, "We're not going to comment on his business".
It was a tough conversation, and then we fell in love.
The president joked about media criticism of the remarks he made, which some considered inappropriate for the husband of the state, as well as his positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV host:
I didn't give up on anything.
The president noted that Kim Jong Un was interested in a second meeting, the first of which was held in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea.
However, nuclear disarmament negotiations are delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a similar response from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead the United States maintains sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We're having a great relationship now.
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had been successful: they ended rocket tests, helped free hostages and returned the remaining American troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
It's easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, we'd have 200 people here", Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd gathered right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds
After the earthquake on Lombok Island, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of roof over the head by more than 10% of Lombok residents, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases the authorities have made it very clear that they do not need international support, so the situation is difficult", said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet clear whether international personnel will be able to work at the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Pala to see if international aid should be allowed.
In the face of the constant shaking in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to deal with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Pal  despite the warning  probably affected the death toll.
Even under the most favorable conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed on Lombok Island is heading for the city of Palo to provide assistance to earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's infrastructure a major focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds for roads and railways.
However, in the run-up to next year's election, the presidential administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo has come under pressure from the country's continued religious tensions, with the majority of Muslims embracing a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people have died and tens of thousands have lost their homes to fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows, and other simple weapons in the streets.
Look at Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scoring the goal in a draw with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the English Premier League by scoring the goal in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a call from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's gate at a 1-0 downturn to his team.
Before he fired a shot at the remote gate, he turned the ball over to his left foot.
The ball was bouncing high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then she came to the gate, flying over the Cape Arrizabalagha, which was coming towards her.
"I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri always try to get it as far forward as possible.
I noticed Kante coming, I took the ball and I gave it away without thinking.
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime after Belgian star Eden Hazard was shot in the 25th minute.
The Blue Devils forward kicked the ball with his heel at Mateo Kovacic, then ran towards Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
Then he made a beautiful move forward into the penalty box back to Hazard.
Hazard outranked the defenders and turned his left foot towards a long pole of fire that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832
According to the Indonesian Disaster Agency, the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in that country rose to 832 on Sunday morning.
At the conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday left many people trapped under rubble, and that the shock caused a six-meter-high tsunami.
Populated by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman
After a woman's body was found this morning in the village of Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the murder.
Police are asking for contact from anyone in the area who has seen or heard any suspicious incidents.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner of Investigation, said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to call on all those people who were then in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose registrars may have stored useful material during the investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, people claiming to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they're in the process of informing the victim's family of the incident.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into a residential building, but was informed by police that the building was currently off limits.
He was silent when he found out what happened.
Residents have just been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes anytime soon.
One of the officers was heard explaining to the man that the area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She kept saying, "It's so horrible.
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the fenced area, and another police vehicle was parked right next to it.
There are officers inside the detached zone guarding the apartment building.
Information is requested by Twitter (@MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or anonymously by Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's monument before the British Parliament as the last victim in the history-rewrite dispute
Removing the monument would bring justice for reminiscent of the Taliban's actions of destroying many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as insanity and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "Given the ongoing debate over removing the monuments, the debate over Oliver Cromwell's identity outside the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The outrageous actions during the English Civil War were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps it was his ancestor Thomas' actions that decided centuries earlier to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell on the monument reflects the reputation of the 19th-century politician and the fact that he is still a person to remember.
John Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was seen by many people, perhaps more often in the 19th century than he is today, as the defender of parliament from outside pressure.
The validity of this statement is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
But what is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the parties to the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honour and commemoration.
In China, a farmer was fatally stabbed by a pig.
According to local media, a deadly pig attack on a farmer took place at a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and severed near a pig at a market in the city of Liupanshui, Kuejczou province.
A pig farmer prepares to be vaccinated at a pig farm, May 30, 2005, in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, a man came to the market with his cousin from the neighbouring Junnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the body of a man and noticed the door open at a nearby pig farm.
He said there was a big pig with blood on his tail.
The autopsy confirmed that it was a nearly 250-pound pig that fatally disturbed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bleeding and pokey", a man named Wu told Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan arrived at the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The fair's manager told Guiyang Evening News that while police were gathering evidence, the petitioner was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the authorities at the fair are negotiating death reparations.
There have been previous reports of attacks on humans by pigs, although these are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and a man was fatally wounded.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a nearly 300-pound pig stung a farmer into a tractor, and a man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger brutal behavior.
They just want to play.
They're as curious as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the proper respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are causing heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, the storm is losing strength as it moves over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, heavy rainfall will be expected in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is hitting the top of the world at a speed of nearly 300 miles per hour. It was named Category 1 on Sunday at 5:00 a.m. eastern time.
According to the forecast, Rosa will be moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form as it heads eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and on Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula as a tropical storm, moving moist air masses northward into the southwestern United States.
Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 centimeters across parts of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause torrential rainfall in the Southwest.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to flash flooding, pollution displacement and possible desert landslides.
Tropical humidity will cause anywhere from 5 to 7.5 centimetres of rainfall per hour, particularly in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 inches of rain is forecast in some areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Because of the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is certainly encouraging to walk through the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into raging rivers, and thunderstorms can cause local winds and dust to move.
Coming in will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
There is a possibility of rainfall of a total height of over 1.3 cm, which may cause small movement of pollution and road hazard.
It would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, with rainfall expected in more areas on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region of the western United States and continue through Wednesday.
In October, along with the cooling of the Arctic, temperatures across the United States could fluctuate, but it's likely to be warmer in the intertropical zone.
It can lead to rapid temperature changes over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis, Missouri, and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit.
In the coming days, the summer temperatures that continue to rise may rise again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience warm early October, with temperatures expected to range between 26 and 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern Great Plains to the northeastern part.
On Tuesday, the temperature in New York City could reach as high as 27 degrees Celsius, or about five degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have watched the interviews with Bret Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's six-hour television broadcast of Supreme Court Justice Bret Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman who accused a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political deadlock on Friday, commentators had to cut off regular programming to inform of a sudden comeback: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh had strangled her in a coma and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
In his emotional statement, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that this was not the case.
It's possible that the Friday TV viewership was even higher than Nielsen's 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, no figures were yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring workplace visibility.
The figure is close to the number of viewers who watched the football World Cup or the American Film Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day's interview.
In second place was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
In the early hours of the morning, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras after the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination, and on the video he shouts at protesters who prevented him from entering the elevator on his way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake, with his head down, listened to the negative reviews for a few minutes, and the entire event was broadcast on CNN.
I'm standing here in front of you asking.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
You have the strength to face the impotence of so many women you've heard from a woman demonstrating.
Before the elevator door closed, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and would speak at the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast events pending a vote on Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he'd only support the nomination if he knew the FBI was going to investigate the charges next week, which the Democratic minority insisted.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made his decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans wouldn't have the votes they need to approve the nomination of Bret Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations made against Bret Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their own advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing on the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, alongside the one featuring Theresa May on the front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson in her government attacked the plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, which the UK and EU could charge tariffs on their behalf, calling it "totally ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrested Dyton Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player.
According to Baton Rouge Police Department reports, 20-year-old Dyton Simpson was arrested and placed under arrest on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to a report from the CBS affiliate WAFB, police officers found the glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson's DNA.
Police said after Simpson was questioned, he confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the defendant's lawyer, the bail amount was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge released an initial report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police department thanked the Louisiana State Police Search Team, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, Southern University Police Department and the surrounding community for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the local law enforcement for their hard work and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
A 6-foot-8 man grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father, Wayne Sims, also played basketball at LSU.
In his final season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wayde's death.
"It's one of those things we're always afraid of", Will Wade said.
Half the volcano's ash reaches Mexico City.
Half of the ash extracted from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Center for Natural Disasters prevented Mexicans from approaching the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over 24 hours.
The center has recorded numerous thud and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday as protesters battled with police forces to prevent Catalonia's independence, and thousands took part in hostile demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the country's secession referendum.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs and powder paint on police officers, and dark clouds of dust swept streets usually filled with tourists.
The clashes also took place later in the day, and police used sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted, "We do not forget, we do not forgive", while opponents of secession shouted, "Long live Spain".
According to local media, 14 people received medical treatment for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, tensions have not diminished, and while the Madrid authorities have declared it illegal, it is still a cause for celebration for Catalans who want secession.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but attendance was low due to a widespread boycott by the opposition.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of pro-independence activists decided to stop a demonstration in support of the police.
The demonstration took place despite this, but the route was changed.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protests, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"Last year we had one of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents were crying for the joy of having the right to vote, but now we're stuck in a dead end", he said.
Despite a significant, albeit minor victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties in favour of Catalonia's secession struggle to continue their activities, and many of the most recognized leaders have either decided to leave or are awaiting trial in custody over their role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests by phone supporting the police, said politicians on both sides of the conflict were fueling the conflict.
The situation is getting more tense, he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his intention to start next year's European Parliament elections.
'Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values in the Spanish government,' he said.
Londoners: men arrested for driving into a house
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car hit a house in the city of Londonderry on multiple occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30pm (BST).
Commissioner of Investigative Affairs Bob Blemmings said the damage involved the gate and the building.
At some point, a shot from a cushion could have been fired at the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston wins the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Mango's first goal for Livingston brought the team a win.
Livingston, who has been playing in extra-level since this season, has stunned the Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard his second defeat in his 18 games as Ibrox Park manager.
Dolly Mengi's goal was a victory, and Gary Holt's team moved up to second place in the table, tied with Hibernian.
The team, led by Gerrard, is on a losing streak this season, and next Sunday the team will face Hearts, who are out for eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna for the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston is extending his division winning streak to six games, and coach Holt hasn't lost since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few chances against an unprepared opponent.
The team that Holt led should have taken the lead much earlier because the team's game has caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and shot into the gate light, but he couldn't score, then Alan Lithgow missed after he took over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing they could threaten their opponents during regular parts of the game.
And that's how the deciding gate fell.
After the Rangers threw a free throw, Livingston's team found an opportunity, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to create a situation for Mendé, who scored a goal from the penalty box.
At this stage, the Rangers had more property, but they were unable to overpower the hosts' defenses and did not cause any major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
This pattern was repeated in the second half, with Alfredo Morelos firing one shot at Kelly's gate.
Scott Pittman's trial was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to get to the light of the gate from another permanent piece of evidence in Livingston's favor.
The Rangers continued their offense at Livingston's penalty box, but were unable to take advantage of the situation, claiming two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against replacement Glenn Middleton and one handed game, but in both cases the players' claims were rejected.
Fenomenal performance of Livingston  analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and score for Livingston.
He thinks they've done great, once again going beyond expectations.
Their style and composition have remained virtually unchanged since their return to the extra-classroom, but Holt is to be commended for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers had no will to fight.
Although Gerrard's leadership has given them great moments, they have failed to live up to their standards in the game.
There was something missing in their game, they only managed to break through the home defense once, which should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During the breakfast on Saturday in Berlin (September 29), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
The dispute has led to differences on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
It is the largest city of Turks outside their homeland.
Police said that for security reasons, 25,000 people gathered outside the temple were blocked, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan's opponents, including many Kurds, also decided to express their views, condemning the Turkish leader's policies and the German government's decision to adopt policies in the country.
The protests are a reflection of the divisions created by the visit of a politician who was hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and who was considered an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident happened near the busy intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, a south-eastern suburb of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time (BST).
The driver stopped the vehicle and the paramedics arrived, and despite the intervention, the man died at the scene.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officers are working to identify the dead man and inform family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were arranged, and drivers were instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Correctional Facility: Six officers injured in riots
According to the authorities, six officers were injured in riots at a male prison with a high level of security.
The riots at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire began around 9:30 am local time (BST) on Sunday and continue.
A specialised unit called in to the tornadoes involving eight prisoners in one of the wings.
Officers on the scene have minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: "A specially trained staff was involved in the action at HMP Long Lartin Penitentiary.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our facilities, and we believe that those responsible will be turned over to the police and can spend more time in prison.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the facility's director had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prevention unit was called to the plant because of a violent riot in which workers were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible for a beneficial impact on areas affected by drought)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, and it's likely to do so early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert lands of the Southwest, threatening flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of possible flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and rainfall will begin on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the Arizona state border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rainfall, and in some areas of Mogollon Rim, Arizona, it can reach as high as 15 inches.
In the remaining desert areas of the Southwest  including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin  the height of the rainfall is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside the areas affected by the sudden flooding from the rainfall that accompanied Hurricane Rosa can benefit from the relief that the region has been experiencing for some time.
Although flooding is a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the drought-prone Southwest.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe droughts, the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will reach the California Peninsula in Mexico first.
Rosa continued to move with hurricane force on Sunday morning, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, which causes it to weaken.
The forecast is that a tropical storm will hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico could pose a major flood risk.
Weather.com reported that rainfall from the California Peninsula to northwestern Sonora is expected to be between 7 and 15 centimeters, although it may reach 25 centimeters.
Then, the storm will pass through Mexico northward in the form of a tropical storm, and in the early hours of Tuesday, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression, and by Tuesday evening, it will make its way to southern Utah.
"The greatest threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, northwestern Sonora, and southwestern desert areas of the United States", says the National Hurricane Center.
Rainfall is projected to cause life-threatening flash floods and the movement of pollution into the desert and mudslides in the mountainous area.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. local time.
The victim was taken to the hospital and her condition remains stable.
According to Avon and Somerset Police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers are requesting contact from anyone with footage of the incident.
Trump has said that Brett Kavanaugh has acknowledged the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had experienced the viciousness and anger of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations of Christina Blasey Ford, who claims that a couple of decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man sexually assaulted her.
Ford also testified during her hearing on the charges she made.
On Saturday, the president said that the day would be a great day for Americans to experience Kavanaugh's brilliance, class and courage.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote of support for one of the most distinguished lawyers of our time, a law clerk with great community service", he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Bret Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the presidential election, which is about halfway through.
"We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running in this election, but I'm still very active, he said.
I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates.
Trump claims the Democrats are pursuing a policy of resistance and disruption.
As one of the Republican Party's top policy aides told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
At least 384 people were killed, many of them by high waves hitting beaches, following a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palá, Spain, to attend the festival, and at dusk, waves as high as six metres [6.5 ft] hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the threat came yesterday, people on the beach did not immediately escape and were killed by the tsunami", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian natural disaster agency BNPD, told a conference in Jakarta.
The tsunamis attacked everything in their path, robbing cars, logs and homes, Nugroho reported, and then added that before reaching the coastline, the elements were moving into the sea at a speed of 800 km/h.
He said some of them climbed trees to save themselves and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Pal.
Aerial photos published by the disaster agency show many destroyed homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, a secondary earthquake struck the coastal city.
There have been a series of earthquakes in an area of 2.4 million people.
According to a statement by the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Utilization Agency (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said that the geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as significant and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found beneath the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people are reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palau, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, communications were almost completely paralyzed, so there were no reports from Donggala province.
There are over 300 000 people living there  read in the Red Cross statement.  It was also added that the organisation's staff and volunteers will go to the disaster areas.
"We can talk about tragedy now, although the situation may worsen significantly", the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced widespread criticism for not reporting the tsunami in Palos, but authorities said the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video posted on social media shows a man screaming from a building trying to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the wall of water broke down on the shore, robbing buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palos, and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city is open only for humanitarian transportation and the airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Pala.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinay, World Vision's national director, the organization's staff arrived safely from Donggala Province to Palau City and found shelter in the breeze tents in the office yard.
They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed, he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly starting to deliver aid, there have been criticisms that the travel of experienced international humanitarian workers to Palácio is being prevented.
Under Indonesian law, the acceptance of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only be initiated after the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
'We are still officially facing a regional disaster,' said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
If the government finds that there has been a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid.
Two days after the earthquake and tsunami in Palau, friends and families of the victims still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves amid the devastation.
A little boy was pulled from the sewers Saturday.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian Paralympic Team, has trained two missing Paralympic athletes participating in the Asian Games in Indonesia this month.
As Petra Mandagi said, the other people trapped at the Ro Ro Hotel were his students.
"As an experienced paralytic, I'm struggling with my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon Subandono said that within hours of the paratroopers' community hearing about the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, he desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to athletes attending the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
I think that means the messages were not delivered.
Thieves stole $26,750 while they were filling in cash at the Newport on the Levee mall.
According to a statement from Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling in cash at a cash machine at the Newport on the Levee mall.
"The driver of the car was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to replenish the cash", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man ran from behind to a Brink employee and stole a bag of cash from an ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
Any person with information regarding the identity of the thief is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: "A person formerly known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time, which is also the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change came before a visit to Saturday Night Live, and the artist is expected to present his new album, Yandhi, during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who has said she has dropped out for emotional reasons.
West has previously stated that the word Ye is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic surname but has religious significance.
I think that ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means Ty, as West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio host nicknamed Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's all about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person, now I'm Ye's reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows us who we are.
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West associate, also wrote his pseudonym in a variety of ways, with a connector, without a connector and in capital letters.
Mexico's elected president Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of the student demonstration, the elected Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador promised to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly financial aid to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for AI research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China's activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The note is related to the AI announcements made by various US government agencies, even though the US does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan to become the most innovative country in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"We should double the budget for AI research first: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area", said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funding could double the chances of another breakthrough in artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that beat the best American Othello player of his time, then took a management position at Microsoft Research and was the president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee acknowledged the success of previous US government technology initiatives, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects, and asked about the date of the next edition of the fight, as he believed it would help find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants.
"It's not China that takes away the best academics, it's corporations", Lee said.
For several years now, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States develop the IS.
I think that AI professionals who have earned a PhD should automatically get a green card.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create next-generation artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to academic institutions in a manner similar to the US National Science Foundation and other government organizations that provide funding to American scientists, but the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense had established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA also announced $2 billion in funding for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests over $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US initiative to create a national AI safety committee has been moving forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would help to end a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is the historic country of Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has therefore vetoed its accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on the naming of the island, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs living in Macedonia.
President George Iwanow has said he will not participate in the vote, and the campaign to encourage boycotts has raised questions about whether turnout will reach the minimum 50% required to make the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: 'Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that the price is worth paying for Macedonia's accession to organisations such as the European Union and NATO.
'I voted for the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two thirds of the members of parliament.
The state election commission said no unusual events had been reported as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout at this time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016.
'I voted for my children, our place is in Europe,' said 62-year-old Joshe Tanewski, a Skopje voter.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country's name to open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
'We support NATO and EU membership, but we want to join these organisations with our heads up, not our backs,' Kawardarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in the referendum, because 80% of the citizens support the European Union and NATO", Zaew said after the vote.
He said that voting yes was a confirmation of our future.
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian television, Telma TV plans to vote 57% of respondents in a referendum on Sunday.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, attendance must be 50% plus one vote.
The referendum defeat would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats all of Brighton 's defenses and takes the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent Brighton's defence home in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday.
The gate that Aguera took in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action started with a pitch-in to the Argentine forward.
The football player outscored three of Brighton's defenders.
Aguero then joined four of Brighton's players.
He played one of them first, then he beat the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's penitentiary.
He was playing left field, where Sterling was waiting for him.
The English striker immediately passed the ball back to Aguera on penalties, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-handed shot.
"Aguero is struggling with a foot injury", Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky to have him at the gate during that time.
However, it was Sterling who secured the Blue the first ever Premier League singles lead.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero got the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great signal down the left side of the field to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move on the far poles.
Manchester City striker pointed the ball at the net just before it hit the cars.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the UEFA Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55pm and will play their home matches at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the chances of the Rockies winning.
After losing his chances to the Washington Nationals in the playoffs, Scherzer didn't have to make the starting lineup.
However, the rivalry-loving Scherzer hopes to make his debut against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, provided the Rockies retain a chance to make the playoffs.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win the Friday game against the Nationals 5-2, but they still want their first division title.
Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we'll get out there knowing that Denver's atmosphere and the opponents' performance will be at their highest level, as they have been for the rest of the season.
Why wouldn't I want to be in this meeting?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting rotator for Sunday's game, but the team is keen to put Scherzer in the starting lineup.
It would be Scherzer's 34th first-team appearance, and the player has taken part in Thursday's rowing practice and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA, striking out 300 batters and tallying 220 and 2/3 innings.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, discussing the importance of Republican attendance in the presidential election, which is about halfway through.
'We will be putting all our achievements on the table in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not launching, but I'm still very active, always defending our great candidates, he said.
He went on to say, "We're dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats, and we're seeing what they're doing with our own eyes.
They are determined to take power by any means possible.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to hurt to gain power and control, and they're not going to give it back.
He said the Democrats are carrying out a mission to resist and hinder operations.
"It's been very good to see that for the last four days", he said, "calling the Democrats bad, mean, nasty and untrue".
The president referred the Senate Judiciary Committee by citing Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was met with a loud crowd cheering.
Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
Oh, I hear you?
No, I mean, no, her body language was fatal, it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The Party is intolerant of people expressing their opinions
When Momentum activists in my party voted to give me a kick, I wasn't surprised.
After all, I'm a member of a group of Labour MPs who were recently told they were not welcome, and all because of their own opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for a dismissal was a result of a disagreement between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, and ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the previous leaders' stance on these issues.
The announcement of the Labour Party's meeting in Nottingham East on Friday read: 'We want the meetings to be open and productive'.
In my eight years as a Labour Party member, most of the Friday afternoon General Committee meetings looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now different, and the promise of a more sincere and gentle policy has long been forgotten, as long as it has been remembered.
It is increasingly clear that there is no tolerance for differences of opinion within the Labour Party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over as chairman, and colleagues, who I thought had similar views, started to expect me to change direction and take positions I had previously disagreed with, on issues like national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech  whatever the content  I encounter on social media attacks calling for the removal of nominations, condemnation of centristism or leaving the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm making are more political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but they do not shy away from further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of current politics is moving into the agenda of insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views, but with every request for a vote of no confidence and every change in election rules, the party's outlook is constricted.
I've been told repeatedly over the last two years not to bend over and keep things quiet, and then everything would be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student in the wake of the negligence of Margaret Thatcher's government that led to the collapse of my schooling, I have been working to improve the quality of public services for people in need as both a local councillor and minister.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew of my differences with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday's motion, I would like to say that I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services.
But the most important message I am sending is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour and others): I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political goals will deter me from acting in accordance with your convictions and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr v Melrose 38:17  undefeated Ayr are back on the mountain
Two late arrivals could have distorted the outcome, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this very interesting Scottish extra-league match.
The team has been ranked first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, it was a remarkable defense and better use of the opportunity that led the home team to victory.
"The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeaten, so I am happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: "We have to respect Ayr players, they've bettered us at taking advantage of the opportunities they've presented.
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson and Fraser Clim's promotion, however a yellow card for Scottish forward Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to tie the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an unused promotion shot.
Climo improved Ayr's lead after kicking from the penalty spot just before the end of the first half, first gaining a penalty and then taking the chance to improve, giving Ayr a 17-5 lead.
Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's effort, raised by Baggot, cut the loss to five points.
The following year, the team was suspended for a further time due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, and Ayr was relegated from the field after the team was relegated to the Championship.
The next acting team captain, Ayr Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card, and Melrose re-used his numbers: an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the lead when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for defeating Climate without a ball.
Climo took the opportunity to get a promotion, then he managed to get a promotion again just after the game started when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty kick and allowed winger Gregor Henry to take fifth place for the hosts.
The star of the show Still Game is starting his career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the show Still Game, seems to be starting his career in the food industry.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, and co-creates the series with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the show's history, indicating that Ford Kiernan is already planning for the future after leaving Craiglang.
According to official data, he became the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun's source suggested Kiernan was trying to get involved in the growing Glasgow catering industry.
The sea belongs to us: the sea-locked Bolivian woman is hoping the court will reopen her way to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying from public buildings.
The following motto appears in the naval ports from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon: "The sea is ours by law".
It's our duty to recover it.
In the unreached Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century resource conflict is still alive, just like the dream of sailing again across the Pacific Ocean.
The hope is perhaps the greatest in decades, and Bolivia is awaiting a ruling by the International Court of Justice, due to be delivered on October 1 after a five-year trial.
'Bolivia's actions are taking off, with the people being unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict,' said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will be watching the International Court of Justice sitting together, hoping that the Hague-based organization will recognize Bolivia's claim and that after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to enter into negotiations to grant the country independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who will be in the controversial re-election race next year, also hopes for a ruling on Monday.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a decision in favor of Bolivia are slim and that even a favourable decision would change little.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile to Bolivia and has also warned that it will not affect any negotiations.
Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, said the International Court of Justice's decision would be issued six months after the final arguments were presented.
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years could have pushed the country away from its target.
'The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,' Paz Zárate said.
Morales' relentless rhetoric has stripped the Chileans of any vestiges of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult given the situation.
In the case of these two countries, there has been no exchange of ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court's decision-making process was extremely fast.
He said Monday would bring Bolivia a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile and the opportunity to end a 139-year period of disputes for mutual benefit.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was still using the issue of access to the sea as a political game.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"Renouncing is a great opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past".
North Korean officials say nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as they can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the pledges made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of both countries.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the "crazy" thing is that the lack of sanctions lifting and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War has ever put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is not willing to sign a declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering the destruction of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of large headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely cover yourself from the sun, we have good news for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a series of crazy, oversized headscarves as part of their 2019 summer collection, which shine in style during Paris Fashion Week.
These unusually unconventional hats were on Instagram this summer, and these designers decided to showcase their amazing creations on the runway.
Valentino's most notable work was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide feathered round that overflowed the heads of the models.
Other extra-dimensional accessories included jewel-decorated arbuses, a wizard's hat, and even ananas, but they were not designed to warm the head.
Thom Brown also showed a number of strange masks just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had their mouths sewn and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style more than haute couture.
One creature looked like a scuba diving kit with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break with the big fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion observers predict that huge hats could hit clothing stores.
The immense hats follow the straw hat with a 61 cm round, which everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski was wearing.
The iconic brand behind this incredibly impractical hat that has been circulating on social media has unveiled another big creation on the runway, a straw beach bag almost as big as a model in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange bag of raffles, finished with raffle frills and crowned with a white leather sleeve, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a star designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags to hit stores next summer, because the designer has made such an impact, it's hard not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills essential to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly proud of their academic achievements  In 2018 they could boast of further excellent exam results, coupled with individual and collective successes in sport, the arts, music and other social endeavors.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents schools with over 30,000 pupils across Scotland and aims to provide the best possible service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career paths and their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector with the potential to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of schools, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to another person in a language they understand, it goes into their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it reaches his heart.
It's a clear reminder that we can't rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last examination this year show that languages are ranked first in the league, with the highest achievement rates for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages received a higher grade than their peers.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of pupils achieved a higher A in Mandarin, 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, language education as a subject of choice is conducted in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) courses in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of candidates had a lack of language skills as a reason for the difficulty in filling vacancies for employers.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for a career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world where language skills are required in increasingly large numbers of jobs.
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future  regardless of the career path you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person competing.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language that had a double-digit percentage of users, or 15%.
That is why investing in foreign language learning is so important to today's children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important to the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, which will be taught by specialised teaching staff.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating an environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed  regardless of what the future holds for them.
It is now undeniable that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and therefore must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer a wide range of choice, diversity and standards to Scottish youth.
It's just the way it should be.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans looking to see LeBron James' debut for the Los Angeles Lakers have finally met their expectations.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that LeBron James will play Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a fraction of a minute.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games for the Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need to be in pre-season games to prepare", he said.
The Trump campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump-planned election hearings to be held next week, with stops in his favorite places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his withdrawal from the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans could be in danger of losing control of Congress when the vote is cast in November.
What time is the Trump election in West Virginia tonight, and where can you watch it online?
The Trump election in Wheeling, West Virginia will be held today at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So, the election of Trump in West Virginia will be live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, which were held in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the expected Senate vote to suspend the election for a maximum of one week during the FBI investigation.
The main purpose of this series of elections, however, is to support Republicans facing the difficult November election.
So President Trump's five-seat campaign next week is about mobilizing volunteers and supporters to help protect and expand the Republican majority in the Senate and House.
"Congress control is such an important item on the president's agenda that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to give his name.
Today's rally at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh and West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia, a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is losing the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president comes to support him in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcases the spirit of struggle, hoping to win Sunday singles
After three one-way sessions, the four-man format on Saturday afternoon could have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swing swing swing is a completely fictitious sporting concept, but one that athletes really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So what's their distribution like right now?
"They led by six points, and now they're only four points ahead, so I think we're a little behind", Jordan Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, with 12 more to come.
But Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have good role models, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and could boast of three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in every way and sets an example.
The shouts to his throat, a sign of excitement, became louder and louder during his round, drowning the key putt and winning the game as he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His impact on the ground, which gave them a 15th-place win, was met with a similar cry, "" that implies the American team is still in the game.
"You just have to focus and worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but lovely couple from the European team won four out of four and they were right.
Mollywood is the only couple that didn't count the bogeyes on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeyes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and the energy that seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that these players must be beaten on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It's best if they play different holes at the same time.
It is too early to talk about a European team winning.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the double on the front nine dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they'd never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday who can help us get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how the strategy can change in one instant.
Europe had played better as a team and had a significant lead on the final day, but the foursome session also showed that the US team had a grip on the fight that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe, 10-6 includes the lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday's fourball and foursome games against the United States.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead, taking two wins over Tiger Woods, raising their previous record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the underdog American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series 3-1.
The United States put up a stronger foursome, winning two games, but could not recover their losses.
To keep the trophy, Jim Fury's team must score eight points out of 12 singles that will be played on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while alongside Molinar (the team was named Molliwood after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball style, they beat the pumped Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau, giving them an even more empathetic 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through two Saturday games, occasionally showed flashes of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games so far in fourball and foursome, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who is not participating in the morning fourball format, has returned to Henry Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked 1st and 3rd respectively, by 2&1
However, the European team did not think of everything on that pleasant, cold day in the field southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American benchmark by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-some, losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a team lost four points by starting a single, although a draw would have been enough for a Fury team to retain the trophy.
However, with the second place two days ago, Sunday's counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea is talking about unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday during a speech at the UN that the failure to lift sanctions only deepened North Korea's distrust of the United States and there was no way that the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea took significant goodwill measures last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"We don't see any concrete response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under these circumstances there is no talk of North Korea unilaterally disarming.
While Ri reiterated North Korean complaints about Washington's reluctance to take a gradual approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for its gradual action, his statement appeared significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it has in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent US president and the leader of North Korea, held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and Trump promised security guarantees for North Korea.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950-1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls for a relaxation of the stringent international sanctions against North Korea.
The United States insists on denuclearization first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forcible manner, even opposing the signing of the declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The warning that sanctions can get us down on our knees is the frown of people who act ignorantly towards us.
The problem is that if the sanctions are not lifted, we are increasingly distrustful.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the US leader spoke about earlier this week at the UN forum.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and then added: "If the denuclearization party was South Korea, not the United States, then there would have been no such impasse on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula".
Mim is, Ri's tone of speech was completely different from last year's when he said at the UN General Assembly that North Korea's missile launch into US territory was inevitable after Mr. Evil President Trump called Kim Jong Una a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN forum, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said that much work needed to be done, and said that until North Korea is stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be lifted.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't set a time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council forum on Thursday that: "The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue and be uninterrupted until we find complete, final and verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours North Korea condemned him for making gangster demands.
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon Jae-in this month to demolish the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that the appropriate measures he was concerned about were security guarantees Trump had pledged to provide in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year provided all students with more sleep, which was designed to combat the growing macho culture of learning by caffeine-driven students all night long.
Academic students at the best universities in the world often have no idea what it's like to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to create the course by giving a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"A girl came up to me after the speech and said, 'Why am I only being told this now that I'm in my final year of college?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me", the Telegraph said.
This year's first class explains to students how good sleep habits help them achieve good results in science and sports and improve overall student well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said the course was set to begin after it was discovered that students had been suffering from severe sleep deprivation for a week.
The hourly course includes a range of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of a room in the academy where students click cups of coffee, curtains, exercise and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects sports outcomes, as well as the importance of maintaining regular sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not cause an immediate change in the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking, Professor Czeisler added.
A culture of pride in all-nighter learning still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Providing enough quality sleep should be the only weapon students can use to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which keeps the student hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Cheisler develop the course after attending one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a full campus course.
The next step, he said, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar programme before moving to a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set up an alarm to remind them when to go to bed and when to get up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LEDs that can disrupt daily rhythms and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga is taking Gerrard 's team
The Rangers were again hit in a fight at the Livingston exit when Dolly Menga shot down Steven Gerrard's dismantled team, scoring 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first win since their 4-1 victory over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard in 18 matches for the second time, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader  Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment didn't look like it was going to improve.
While the Rangers were down to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third just behind Hibernian with a one-goal loss.
The Rangers may have further trouble with the need to treat the head wound of linebacker Calum Spence after he was hit by a pitch thrown from the bench for guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and progress to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same Livingston 11th who took a point from the Hearts team last week, being delighted by the way his well-trained team tormented their opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball, but it was the Livingston team that did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes when that first pitch by Meng allowed Scott Pittman to face Alan McGregor's goalkeeper, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only stay in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he deserved a penalty kick 15 minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless came across each other, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were only able to fire two target shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute opening goal may have been a blow to the game, no one can deny that he was well deserved for his efforts.
Again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep, steady piece of play made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, handing it to Meng in order to simply finish the action.
Gerrard did not play in the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. This almost immediately affected the winger who threw the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it by getting out of his position.
Livingston's team continued to draw guests into the game exactly the way they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett were playing long runs one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the final minutes, but McGregor got a good lead in front of Jacobs, and then Lithgow pulled the game out of the corner.
Rangers reserve Glenn Middleton once again hoped for a penalty kick when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, which featured the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter that's used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you'll hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.
Now we hear something!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect hostile cells.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and destroy hostile cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method involves removing immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory.
Then they can detect a protein common to many cancers and then inject it back into the body.
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman who was receiving a vaccine to help her immune system recognize hostile cells lost an ovarian tumor for more than 18 months.
The method is to remove the immune cells from the patient, change them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that this vaccine is doing very well.
HER2 drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and learning to locate cancer cells has worked in the treatment of certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West is going to a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA cap on his head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was fired in the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the words "Make America Great", he demonstrated against the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
Every time I talk to white people, I hear, "How can you like Trump? He's a racist!"
If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL's program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked the testimony of Bret Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's interview video was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh by posting the post.
Besides, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had a problem with his hat.
They're coming at me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
They're on me!
And then they say I have no choice, said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You say I have no choice?" and he added, "I'm going to put on a superman spell caster so you can't tell me what to do.
Let's just accept it.
His words twice caused a public outcry, and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed.
West was invited to perform on the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has intrigued many by performing I Love It in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's conservative group leader, Candace Turner, who tweeted, "To one of the bravest:
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on her Twitter account that West was just herself, and that's absolutely amazing.
However, I will NOT reward anyone (by buying her music or clothes or supporting her art) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We're free, too, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now officially Kanye West.
However, he is not the first artist to change his name. He follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed the name to the symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing incident at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after stabbing a man at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, police report.
The defendant is due to appear in Belfast County Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is raising the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO medieval drama series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor struck a stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen often makes young boys think they have to play tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit said something was wrong and was wondering how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he feels confident enough to raise the issue.
"I personally feel pretty confident at this point where we made a mistake about masculinity?"
What have we taught men as they grow up, from the perspective of the problem we face today?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity because of the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: "What attitudes are inherited and what are learned?
What is being taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys think they have to be on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time. What can we do to change this?
It's clear that not everything is fine with young men.
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be playing in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels after the series ended the following year, saying he was done with battlefields and horses.
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a film producer and his brother a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the set, which gave me my future family and a new life", he said.
In this Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the object of the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the family estate of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to the country's health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost completely, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year on year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that any member of her team has disclosed the Republican Party's senators' data to be dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
Member of the United States House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to the ultra-right wing.
"Lies, lies and even more nefarious lies", Waters tweeted in a statement.
The information reportedly contained the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person at the Capitol during a hearing of a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservative parties such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the mail was linked to Waters' office and published information about a Waters team member , Hill said.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie", Waters continued.
A member of my team  whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations  was in no way responsible for the leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and it is a hundred percent lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
"This kind of denial is wrong", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests she's not in the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't provoke.
He cannot challenge the motives of the accuser.
He's got to keep his cool.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of exaggerating anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a big deal, if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
"The plaintiffs will be exposed and held accountable for any actions that pose a threat to any member of my team", she said.
Johnny English: The Nightmare on Elm Street is a spy parody featuring the weakened Rowan Atkinson.
Looking for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has become the norm, and this seems to apply to the new part of the action-comedy series Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned to theaters in 2011 with Johnny English: Reaction.
Will self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country's new export commodity?
In any case, forever amazed, with a rubber face, incompetent Johnny English has once again been granted a licence to play the game  his name more than anything else indicates that he is a widespread, comic product intended for non-English speaking audiences.
He's obviously a stupid secret agent who, despite his weird taste for glamour smoothie, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau's spike, Jasia Fasoli's spike, and a drop of that guy adding one note to the theme tune of the lead singer of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-renowned mystery man. Atkinson starred in the once-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, leaving behind a mess.
In the latest Johnny English movie, there's one or two moments worth noting.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter in medieval armor, with the spinning shovels hitting his helmet rhythmically.
Atkins's ability to physically play comedy is clearly visible on screen, but his sense of humor seems to be quite low-key and unnecessary, especially now that even major film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film's soundtrack.
The humor seems to be more about children than adults. I don't think Johnny English's crazy adventures are as imaginative and coherent as the gags in Atkins' silent films about Jesse Faisal.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble has always been the most up-to-date assumption.
A cyber hacker infiltrates a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the field to scare off a duty agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the bitter black of the prime minister, who is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power to play the role of Theresy May, but the script doesn't give her the opportunity to develop her wings.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that because of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return one of her retired agents to duty.
And that means the unsuccessful Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving off-the-cuff lessons on how to become a secret agent.
English is summoned to Whitehall for trial, reuniting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the captain of a merry but somewhat tired submarine character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's secret service team return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Opel Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously possessed by a charismatic billionaire tech maniac who claims to solve the UK's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves aboard the luxury yacht Volta; and English seeds havoc while using a virtual reality kit to explore the interior of the Volta house.
In this last sequence, all the restrictions are gone, but despite the nice and loud performance, the whole movie is very much like children's television.
He's a typical average.
Like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder if the British film industry could give Rowan Atkins a role that really matched his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it has developed a plan that provides for four days' work week for the British people, for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan to make it possible for British people to work four days a week and get paid five days.
The party is reportedly asking the CEOs to pass on the savings they have made through the AI revolution to their employees, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend and receive the same amount of wages.
Sources say the idea will fit into the party's economic agenda and plans to leave the country to face the workers.
The shift to a four-day work week was endorsed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to use it to change the economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: "We expect a change in policy to be announced before the end of this year".
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is part of the Party's approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker and of the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea  The Green Party has committed to a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, these plans are not currently supported by all Labour Party members.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not the party's policy and it is not being considered.
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week's Labour Party conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from faceless CEOs and "speculators" in utilities.
The Chancellor's plans from the Shadow Cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share because the Labour government could make deductions based on the abuses detected.
It also confirmed plans to put employees on company boards and to set up integrated ownership funds to transfer 10% of the company's private sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answering the question on the 60 Minutes program, "Can the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh change their minds?"
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Bret Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the establishment of the Bureau of Investigation could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that could change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
Of course, Kennedy said.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh on the way to the hearing.
I called him after the incident, when the charges came up, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was firm, determined and unambiguous.
But Graham's opinion seems to be well-rounded.
"I made a decision about Bret Kavanaugh, and to change it, it takes a strong charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has firmly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
None of the people who filed the complaint could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything's going to change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed to reducing poverty in any way?
Next Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York City, an annual music event that boasts an incredibly impressive cast of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty around the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who come to the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy performances by stars like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the event's most important goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists working to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless they decided to buy a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant activities to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty alleviation.
But what is the achievement of Global Citizen in the 12 years remaining to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is another case of so-called clicktivism where people feel they're doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has seen more than 19 million people support the campaign, working towards a variety of goals.
He also says that these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
The Group has also been involved in the development of the business plan and the development of the business plan.
The Group estimates that the safeguard measures have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and developers committed to helping children reach their full potential, which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen members tweeted more than 4,700 tweets.
"Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make social injustice, which is malnutrition, go down in history". Tracey Ullman, Ambassador for Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives calling on the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
For one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which was 'Why do you think extreme poverty can be eradicated?',
Global citizen responded: "It's going to be a long and difficult road, and sometimes we're going to stumble and fail.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to block Russian energy exports.
Washington could retreat to its navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from pouring into markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinkke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria  especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy trade, as they are doing in Eastern Europe, he said.
The official said there are ways and means to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability to ensure that its navy keeps sea lanes open and, if necessary, blockades to ensure that its energy does not enter the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less fuel use and replacement", he said, comparing Russia to a "fuel-dependent" economy with a single trick.
These statements come as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe  which is a much cheaper option for European consumers than Russian gas.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a slave to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce opposition to the implementation of this project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
'I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers,' Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' position prompted a strong reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the United States to remain neutral in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I think it's a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix a failed government, including the highest-ranking women", The Hill said.
After 6 November, I will consider running for President.
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was going to lead the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren without a garden has expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll published Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who chose the option likely said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick's candidacy: 38 percent supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp who were taken off the list regarding a potential 2020 nominee were Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin is talking about Trace Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the presidential election of Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes home, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", she told an audience at Donald Trump's election in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son's arrest a taboo subject, and then she said of her son and other war veterans: They come back a little changed, come back shaken, come back wondering if there will be respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other members of the military have given to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, making false statements on a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm in a state of disrepair, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an amicus curiae brief in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plea in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and his brutal gangster sons were abusing her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in the Grace-supporting states described Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum seekers are in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the District of Columbia's Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades-old state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle as stated in the amicus curiae letter.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing immigrants entry was damaging to the U.S. economy, claiming that they could become entrepreneurs and create the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national or social affiliation or have such and other political beliefs said Sessions in his statement on 11 June on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems  even the serious ones  that people around the world struggle with every day.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palau, where the death toll has doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more tragic.
"It's a very intense feeling", said the 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, comforting her agitated son in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
An ambulance is bringing the body every minute.
There's no clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching for waterlogged items, and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, quickly filled.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and arm, were resting outside a military hospital in Palma, where patients were being treated outside for severe concussions.
His eyes were filled with tears as he told of the powerful earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save yourself.
I think I got stuck in the wall of rumor. Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of advertising propaganda.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid addendum to the Des Moines Register's China Daily, Iowa's most popular newspaper, accusing China of trying to meddle in the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's allegation that Beijing tried to meddle in the US election confirmed what US officials told Reuters that this was a new stage in Washington's campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to post advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to increased tariffs on mutual imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were expected to affect exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime Iowa governor who is the top exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad stated in an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday that China is now using double the amount of force to harass us by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.
"In expanding its propaganda, the Chinese government is leveraging the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
There will be no opposition in the Beijing street kiosk and no real reflection of the divergences that the Chinese may have about the worrying economic direction China is pursuing given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article, although he did not say which.
Republicans are betraying women with the right to vote in the midterm elections by the Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn.
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh over several sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that these members will face a strong backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this event are incredibly high, and most Republicans are now officially voting.
"This is irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Sen. Jeff Flake's last-minute FBI investigation is enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget until November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive movement MovOn, told the Washington Post on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan "November is coming" in the Senate chamber protesting the decision by Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission not to withdraw Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, as Mic reported.
'The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,' said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, on one of the news sites.
People say he was tall already, and it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against a candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that if Republicans chose to approve the nomination, it could face a strong reaction.
"The Republican Party needs to deal with a little mess", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, "as NBC News reports.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is elected, it's about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled Ford", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told one news channel.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided on who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter being a little more supportive.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh was likely or certainly lying when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a reception while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform of Berners-Lee's Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview for Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is to dominate the world.
"We have to do it now", he said, referring to the startup.
The historic moment has come.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online store with personal data or otherwise POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all in one browser and at the same time.
The unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to the company's president, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to all people.
The company now includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether to make a complete change that will overturn all their business models day by day.
I don't ask them for permission.
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to deliver commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been doing a lot of talking about net neutrality in recent months.
By bringing Inrupt Berners-Lee to life, he will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely excited to think about the next era in network development", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the awarding of the Victorian Cross to a clergyman during World War I
The memory of the only clergyman in the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was commemorated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Major Bernard Vann was awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 September 1918 for his actions at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled the memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that unveiling the stone on the centenary of his grandfather's award was of an exceptionally symbolic nature.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field artillery and machine guns.
He then hurried to the line of fire and with the greatest of bravery he led it forward, then single-handedly attacked the field station, destroying three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I could never resist, but also humble.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath at the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he was honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people.
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got Pig Peppe.
Imagine you didn't sleep all night watching the emotionally packed Bellator 206 gala and ultimately not getting to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala programme featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the UK audience was shocked to learn that the show had been changed to Pig Pepp.
Some were disappointed that they didn't sleep until the early hours of the morning, especially to watch the fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a children's cartoon as some sick joke.
"According to the government's regulation, this type of content is inappropriate to be broadcast at 6am, which necessitates a change to a children's programme", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa's pig, yeah.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would develop a schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"When I think about a repeat, I think we can fix it", Coker said.
But it's Sunday morning, so we won't be able to do this until Sunday, according to our schedule, and Monday, according to their schedule.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we were bombarded with comments that didn't sound friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't a flaw. It was a legal issue.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to limit the show to five fights instead of six, which is the standard amount, and we were trying too hard to please the fans, and unfortunately we got ahead of ourselves.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt worse about his sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water polo player, says he grew up feeling worse than anyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
Appearing on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew older, he felt less valuable than others because the homogeneous likes of boys and girls were not socially acceptable.
He said, "To this day, feeling inferior and being different is what gives me the strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to prove that there was something worthwhile so he wouldn't let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
When you go through so much at such a young age he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later he said it was hard to find someone of his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his perception of certain things had changed completely.
"Last year, the most important thing to me was winning a gold medal", he said.
And you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be with us to be in the front row, Dad, he said.
I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I dreamed of all my life, jumping in front of a crowd at the Olympics, it was the best feeling of all", he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song  Proud by Heather Small  that accompanied him during the Olympics preparations and which still gives him goose skin.

Exhibiting Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during the Ryder Cup Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, playing for the 12th time in the biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often did with the United States team, the five-time major winner had to spend the day doping the team and working to improve his game in the hope of correcting the cause of his bench return.
The 48-year-old, who never gave the easiest hits, even at the peak of his career, doesn't do very well on the narrow Le Golf National, where wrongful hits are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn't discouraging enough for Mickelson, in Game 9 on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesc Molinari, who joined forces with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans (who lost four points in the first 12 singles) start the game with the verve, Mickelson's game could prove extremely crucial.
Furious expressed his confidence in his player.
"He fully understood his role today, he slapped me on the back, he held my hand and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's brought a lot of his bands into the game both past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there were more, but that's what happened, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, and Furyk said his presence has been a big help to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it's nice to have him in the band room, he explained.
I think the younger players have had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings more to his person than just playing.
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the big dot advantage could soon shrink.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant points lead before the single start on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Danish made his debut in 1997 at Valderram Field, where he and his teammate, vice-captain Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but he crossed the finish line by the shortest possible distance, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We can't forget we had a big lead at Valderram Field; we had a big lead at Brookline Field where we lost, and in the case of Valderram Field we won by a hair", Bjorn said in the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday, giving us a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Time will tell me and all the other members of the team that this is not over.
You're gonna do your best tomorrow.
Get out there and do everything right.
It'll only be over when the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, which is to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I told you from the beginning that I'm focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are, the best players in the world.
Bjorn, impressed with how his players have handled the difficult field, added: "I couldn't have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
Tomorrow, they're starting singles, and that's another matter.
It's good to play with your partner when everything's going your way, but when you're playing solo, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
That's the message you have to give the players, give it your best shot tomorrow.
The partner must also give his best.
Jim Furyk, unlike Björn, will expect his players to perform better on their own than on their partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced a major reversal of action on the final day as a member of the winning team at Brookline Field, then suffered a defeat after the European team performed a miracle at Medinah Field.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up his players to fight on the final day.
Tomorrow we're playing 12 big games. You want to start playing fast, like you did at the Brookline and Medina fields.
If this one-way thrust is going to put a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We set our composition properly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to cast the spell of tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of running the contract, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter  other European team players in the top half of the programme.
"I decided on this group of guys in that order because I think he's gonna be able to handle all the games", Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship again delayed
The newest frigate of the German Navy should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and the alarmingly rising costs , according to local media.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was to be commissioned into the Navy in 2014, but due to problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to amend this ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They will, of course, be equipped with a powerful armament, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-turbine missiles, and technological solutions to prevent detection, including radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals  the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from the home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the yard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the invasion, but German media reported a number of key software and hardware flaws that rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, or half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also proved that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the possibility for the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the problem is also the cost of the entire project  including training the crew.
It is said to have reached a staggering level of EUR 3.1 billion (USD 3,6 billion), while the initial cost was EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems with the commissioning of new frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy would end up with a ship capable of use.
He also said that the problem had been exacerbated over time by the withdrawal of old vessels from service without providing replacement vessels.
In addition, he expressed his displeasure that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could be incorporated into the Navy fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats
New research on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is to show how bats use the landscape to get food.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The research, led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will involve dwarfs and dwarfs, as well as long-eared brown bats and red-eared bat in Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be deployed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field trials using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings is intended to determine the frequency of the signals sent by bats and the behaviour of the species.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are being used by each species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The bat population in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects farms and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly gums and certain building materials chemicals, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to search for insects and obstacles in their path.
The NTS, which is responsible for overseeing more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land across the country, treats bats very seriously.
It is composed of ten trained experts who regularly conduct tests, check-ups, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the property manager, says it's the perfect territory for bats.
"Threave has a great bat area", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and wonderful habitats.
But there's still a lot that we don't know about bats, and the work we do here and at other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
It stresses the importance of checking for bat pre-accession pre-accession maintenance on holdings, as the accidental destruction of one bat may kill up to 400 females and young, leading to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected. It is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, and to destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's Bat Conservation Trust officer, has urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don't even know how their populations are doing".
Ronaldo rejects rape charges while his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people would want to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorg, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Friday's Der Spiegel reports, the soccer player was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for her silence.
Ronaldo, 33, hours after the charges were announced, described the news as "fake news" in a live Instagram post to his 142 million followers.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you know what?
Today's news is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and everything is fine, added the footballer with a smile on his face.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine over allegations they called "unacceptable disclosure of suspicions in the area of privacy", Reuters reports.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer will be seeking damages for moral damages in the amount of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident was reported to have taken place in June 2009 in a hotel room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the soccer player's room where he allegedly raped a woman anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a good guy in 99 percent who was seduced by that 1 percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she was photographed in hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and public humiliation.
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement now because she still can't forget the alleged incident.
During the alleged attack, Ronaldo was transferring from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after being paid 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain would always regret the departure of carmakers
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that he was alarmed when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
We need a deal, Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese carmaker said that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit agreement could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, then production at our factory will be stopped", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is planning to close its Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are  as carmakers claim  the supply chain risks if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.
The Toyota production line operates on a just-in-time basis, whereby parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to a company representative, Toyota would not be able to last more than a day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire, which would put production on hold.
Clark said that the Chequers-Theresa May plan for future EU relations is precisely constructed to avoid border controls.
'We need an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the success we have now but also allow us to make the most of the situation,' he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The statements made by not only Toyota but also other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what was a very efficient supply chain.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not yet established the existence of a market economy investor in the Union.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite union's plant board, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: 'We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, according to the White House.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week due to the ongoing battle for Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian election interference, links between Trump's close associates and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a headset to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
But last Monday, he went to the White House to face reports that he was about to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she said: 'The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may be this week or it may be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We'll see, I'll definitely let the press know.
Several journalists have questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked me why.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences was not due to dislike for the "stunted" TV journalists, and then added: "I will not hide that they are stunted".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The current President conducts more Q&A sessions than any other president before him", she said, adding without providing any evidence: "We have seen the numbers".
Press conferences will continue, Sanders said, but if journalists are given the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's a much better solution than talking to me.
We're trying to do this regularly, and we've been doing this very often over the last few weeks, and press conferences will be giving way to these sessions where you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why by being too liberal and sometimes too strange in front of the press.
The Minister of Health is writing to EU employees employed by NHS Scotland over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to EU healthcare workers in Scotland to express their country's gratitude and to ask them not to leave Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for settled status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: 'The negotiations for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union have continued over the past year.
The UK Government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
So I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery for a head injury suffered Saturday night against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in a 31-27 loss to Tennessee, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
"He went to the side of the line, then he leaned down", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side of the line, then put him on his carrier and removed him for further testing.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was undergoing surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that he has not yet received any details about the type/size of injury and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a sophomore exempted from representing the university for a year to hone his skills) is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five shots on Saturday before the game, which gives him 18 shots in the entire season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate when buying property in the UK
Under the new Tory plans, higher tax rates for foreign buyers will be charged for the purchase of real estate in the UK, and the money raised will go to help the homeless.
This move is intended to derail the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a younger electorate.
The tax increase will cover those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department predicts that this will help them earn up to £120 million a year for homelessness.
Theresa May is announcing today that foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher tax rate and the additional funds raised will go to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on those earning more.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and non-taxable companies in the UK.
The additional fee  charged in addition to the current tax rate, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and rented apartments  can be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects this move to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions, especially the capital, have become ghost towns.
The new rules come into effect just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut that would help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big developers of keeping real estate prices high by taking over the land but not using it, and he also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits on cheap housing to end the housing scandal in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rental regulation and an end to evictions for no reason.
It also wants to give local governments more power to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said that as Prime Minister I am committed to rebuilding the British dream of every next generation living better than the last.
It also means repairing our sluggish housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it's not right that people who don't live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become a long one, but the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street remains far more real.
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to become Scotland's national selector '
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his greatest ambition is to become Scotland's national selector at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish man is committed to working to heal the North-East, which is currently third in League One with a three-point loss to the top team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after last season he brought St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to represent my country as a player,
But I only got to the B staff", Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I often watched the Scottish Cup with my father in Hampden, and I was always attracted to it.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed as a club coach.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Alloa Athletic says he doesn't feel ashamed to take on the role of such a prominent figure at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, success will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, it is certainly a place to be.
It's not going to be easy to do, but I'm sure I'll feel like I've succeeded here, provided I do.
Ross's coaching career has spanned three years, before he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and spent 15 months on the coaching staff of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to promotion again after relegation to League Three, and in the following season he led St Mirren from the bottom to the Championship.
Jack Ross says he's much more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real turning point" says Alloa.
I really believed that leading a team was much better than playing.
I'm gonna keep it weird because as a player, I've been doing well, earning well, and achieving some measurable success.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through a different situation.
I still get them when it comes to the stress and pressure of coaching, but I feel good about this role.
I've always wanted to train others, and I'm doing it now, and I can tell you that this is the most appropriate moment of my adult life.
The entire interview on Sportsound can be heard on Sunday 30 September on Scotland Radio between 12:00 and 13:00 BST
Research shows that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a rapid influx of customers to British pubs, but it was reflected in the restaurant chains.
Research shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurants saw a 4.8 percent decline.
Peter Martin of the consultancy CGA, which produced the data, says: "Continuous heat and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Cups made the results in July look similar to those in June, when pub sales rose 2.8 percent, with the difference that restaurant earnings fell even further.
The 1.8% drop in sales in restaurants in June increased even more in July.
Pubs and bars offering drinks did well - sales increased more than the decline in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered from heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
It looks like the people were just thirsty.
Sales of drinks at pubs and bars in the city grew by 6.6 percent this month, while food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, an entertainment and tourism analyst, says: "These results are in line with the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The main factors affecting the volume of consumption outside the home are the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are having a hard time is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales from the previous year will have particularly dire consequences, given the ongoing pressure to cut costs.
The long, hot summer has come at a time that is least favorable for the owners of the food service, and time will tell if the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring much needed cooling.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those that have just opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in pubs, bars and restaurants across the UK, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, setting industry-recognised standards.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
Research has shown that one in five children - some as young as 11 - has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students in primary schools showed an increase in the number of fake Insta sites
These stories have raised concerns that they contain sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they have a primary account that they show their parents.
One in five children  some as young as 11  has social media accounts that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 elementary school students found a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts. The name is a reference to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has raised concerns that the accounts are being used to post sexual content.
Twenty percent of students admitted to having a cheated primary account, which they show their parents, and also have private accounts.
One mother who accidentally came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter encountered a teenager who was urging others to rape her.
A survey of independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to having private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan says, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are creating their own places online where neither parents nor teachers can find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics board.
At the annual general meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland's most successful female athlete, and CEO Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for the sport's leaders to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
'Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British and international lightweight community and we are confident that her appointment to the board will bring great benefits to the Scottish lightweight community,' said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm very happy to be able to give the athletes' voice to the board, and I hope I can really help manage the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk because of a transient aneurysm.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said it would take time to see if I could recover and to what extent.
It was a hard job, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!
Breastfeeding ads that compare mothers to cows are raising extreme emotions online
A dairy company has caused a storm on the Internet by posting an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to breastfed cows.
To announce the launch of the world's first silent breastfeeding pill, its manufacturer, Elvie, has released a ridiculous video ad that highlights the freedom it provides mothers.
It shows four real mothers dancing in a swan-filled box to a song that says, "Yes, I can feel it, but I can't see the tail, and if you haven't noticed, it's not just my tits.
And the chorus goes like this: "Pump them, pump them, I'll feed the children, pump them, pump them, I'll feed my mistress".
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked a major controversy online.
The film has now had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and users are expressing extreme opinions, many of them saying that it's inappropriate to joke about the horror that's happening in the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, they must get pregnant and give birth to calves in order to feed them milk, although their babies are taken away from them a few days after birth, one user wrote.
Elvie lactator can be worn unnoticed under the breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: "It's obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
Sure, let's use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies.
Someone else added: "This ad is completely detached from reality".
Others argue that the video was a joke. One of the women said she thought the song was funny.
I think that's a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
I was just like a cow when I was pulling the food.
The ad is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for a second date.
It's a brilliant invention written by someone.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for mothers who pull food (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like they're screwed.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.
And at the end of the film, it turns out that the women were dancing with their lactators discreetly attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the idea that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
However, Elvie's lactator is completely silent, with no wires or tubes, and can be worn unnoticed underneath a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children, and even leave the house when they pull out food.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: "Elvie's Lectator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By comparing the women who are feeding and the dairy cows, we wanted to showcase all the challenges of food withdrawal, while also presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
This isn't the first time Elvie's lactator has made headlines.
At London Fashion Week, during a show, Marty Jakubowski showed up on the runway with a mother of two with this product attached.
Hundreds of immigrant children were secretly taken to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained is rising rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border every month is virtually unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear being deported if they apply for a child.
That risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living on the joint farm and then passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albence testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had filed for sponsorship of abandoned children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously recorded.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are sponsors or live with them in the same household are living in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal records.
That's why we're constantly chasing them, Albence said.
The shelter's staff say that in an effort to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention  and not after 60 days, as was the norm.
Many will be coming in through videoconferencing rather than in person to ask the immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter staff and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempted escape.
Advocates said that these problems are even more serious in larger centres such as Tornillo, where it is easier to ignore signs that something is wrong with a child because of its size.
They also said that moving children to a tent camp without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma many of them are already dealing with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and we would deal with them accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, the Assembly has been informed.
Moualem says the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced from their homes.
He says Damascus will continue its holy battle to clear Syria of both terrorist groups and all foreigners illegally staying there.
There are currently about 2,000 US troops stationed in Syria, who are mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused some Western countries of creating irrational fear that discourages them from returning.
'We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help us in these cases,' he said.
They are politicizing things that should have a purely human dimension.
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad reaches a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
Diplomats from the UN say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has opened the door for further political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had a clear time frame and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including militants from the Al-Qaeda-linked Levantine People's Defense Front, who would be eliminated.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the ruling and opposition parties soon to draft the post-war constitution of Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying that the panel's work should be limited to verifying the provisions of the current constitution and warned against interference.
Why Trump is gonna win the election again
According to this logic, President Trump would be re-elected to a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers are likely to hope, his presidency ends in impeachment and scandal.
It would be the most dramatic presidential finale yet.
So far, there's no sign of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's premium viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's  has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has been the highest-rated cable program, attracting 3.5 million viewers.
"People fly like bees into the fire" "This is something we don't understand", Neal Bear, executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor", said of the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because I'm laughing".
Chaos is entertainment.
Of course, the reports from Washington could, like nothing else on television, influence the future of Roe v. Wade, the legality of immigrant family reunification, or the state of the world economy.
Excluding the audience is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
Besides, it's not just about being a well-informed citizen watching a panel of experts debate for six hours about Bob Woodward's use of secret informants to write a book called Fear, about Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich jacket (a young man with a loaded pride, as The Washington Post has described it), or the implications of the shocking descriptions of President Trump's anatomical details revealed by Stormy Daniels.
I'll never watch Super Mario again like I used to.
"What he's doing is partly like a reality show in that he delivers new content every night", Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars, told CNN about Trump's changing cast and daily action twists (such as an attack on NFL players or the praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're gonna be late.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away from it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was just standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was being considered.
I remember before we were doing all these crazy programs and people were saying this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Fleiss told me.
I thought they were kidding, but they were right.

The flow of money from outside to the congressional campaign
No wonder the reorganization of the constituencies, which has now resulted in the loss of two current congressmen in a single race, has brought a stream of cash to the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
This newly created Pittsburgh suburban district is represented in Congress by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's 12th District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The map of the counties was corrected after the January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old counties were designated unfairly, giving the Republicans an edge and was unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th District began with a campaign funding battle between the main party funding bodies  the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning a hair in the widely-commented election for the 18th Congressional District, which was held in March.
A Republican has held the seat for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won this district by 20 points.
Political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite Washington's slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panama's President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the Trump Organization's management team was fired by partners, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
The sanctions were intended to be imposed only on El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control and development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial aid and visa-granting to certain individuals, would be very damaging to the Central American country, which has high unemployment and high murder rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to address the findings of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now, at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak, which is to be a signal to invite the administration to a meeting.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no further harsh communications or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst from the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn the history
Another element could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which concrete evidence is currently available to the public.
According to reports, the Robert Mueller investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him as he prepares to reappear before the voters, and may even be tried by a jury.
There are many unknowns here, and I don't want to suggest that the downfall of Trump or his peers in Europe is inevitable.
We all on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will decide how long this can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
It didn't work, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are a few such turning points for the Americans right now.
What are we gonna do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's the future of the Robert Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein's been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that he proposed a secret presidential tape last year and speculated that he's not fit for the job.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
What would we do if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Bret Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault and perjury charges?
And most importantly, will we elect someone to Congress who will hold Donald Trump accountable in the middle of his presidency?
If we don't pass these tests, we're going to have a tough time for democracy.
But I believe we will succeed because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light the shabby candles on that table marked with swastika.
With such a legacy, how could I not look forward to the future?

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the game against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers take the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, after an impressive draw with Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Europa League group stage.
Until the 2-2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrance from playing this season, but he believes that this result will work on the Rangers like a springboard for greater success.
'It's done us well because Villarreal are in good shape,' the 31-year-old said.
We went to this game believing we could do something and we fought for the point.
We might have been able to push them back, but generally, the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
As for Thursday, it's another important night for Europe.
We're hoping to get three points, but this is going to be a tough game because our opponent scored a good score in his last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans, we'll get through and fight for a good score.
Last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we're all feeling good in our places.
The team's great, and the boys really like to play.
I hope we can move on, put this last season behind us and make it work.
Fear of retirement savings is driving women to sleep
Although the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be treated, few talked about it with their families.
In a Nationwide survey, about half of the participants said they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want family members to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Where do you want to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare a family to care for yourself unless you express your will beforehand.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you want to be cared for, as this will be a key factor in determining the cost.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He or she can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows cash to cover such expenses, or from your own property  if you have it.
Prepare legal documents: You'll avoid this court battle.
Please appoint a trusted healthcare representative to supervise and ensure that the appropriate persons act in accordance with your wishes if communication becomes impossible.
Consider hiring an attorney to handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person, who will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are unable to do so on your own.
Remember the details: Imagine that your elderly parent is suddenly in need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
You'll write down all the information you need to get it ready.
It's not just about the finances, it's about who the doctors are.
What medicines are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
It's worth having a plan like that.
A man shot multiple times from a windmill in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times from his windshield as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at about 02:30 BST, as accidental.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
The injuries are not life threatening, and the police are asking for witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Rescue workers were unable to obtain any information from Donggala's mainland, which lies north of Palau, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated from Palos after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and Donggala County on Celebes Island:
Palau is the capital of Celebes Central, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the island's west coast.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit of lower level than a province) stretching along the north-western coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017, 299,200 people lived there.
The main economic activities of Celebes Central are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in Donggala, a coastal town.
Another source of income for the province is nickel mining, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have struck Palo and Donggala several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami struck Donggala, killing more than 200 people and destroying hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami killed nine people in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, which makes earthquakes quite common there.
The most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died as a result.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck in Pidie Jaya County, Aceh Province, causing devastation and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the collapsing buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in its northern part.
They have destroyed thousands of homes and caused temporary trouble for thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, a 29-year-old man was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to file a crime report, he took her phone.
KTUU reports that Palin is being held by Mat-Su's investigator and has a $500 bail.
According to her, he went to court last Saturday, where he said in his defense that he was "certainly innocent".
Pauline is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Paline has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Court of Veterans Claims.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice and possession of a firearm in a state of disrepair in connection with the incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, veterans groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son's aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder he developed while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died in the tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the central part of Celebes Island, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were on the beach in Palos, where the festival was taking place.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
New York state federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
For the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to drive pedestrians and cyclists along his route.
According to the notice filed in the Southern District of New York, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily harm.
According to court documents, both charges carry the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in the course of illegal activity  which is the procedure commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases  and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required a "solid planning and reflection" and described the way Saipov carried it out as "atrocious, cruel and immoral".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damián Pagnucca  the notice of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were in New York for tourism.
The last time the death penalty was introduced in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been convicted two years earlier of conspiracy and spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who is from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse for the months following the attack.
Police say he told the investigator he was feeling good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He's pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were obviously disappointed in the prosecutor's decision.
'We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and refuse life without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all those concerned,' he said.
Saipov's defense team has asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Torys MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for the Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tory Conference, Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize the people's army.
Former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader said politicians must feel the heat of the euro-skeptics when one MP, Theresa May, suggested she should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would be out of the EU.
However, joining the Tories who were fighting for staying in the community in a separate protest against Brexit that was taking place in the city further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks with Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan for a compromise with Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, opponents and the European Union itself.
Her allies say that despite opposition, she will seek to reach a deal with Brussels and force eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her proposal and chaos.
Peter Bone told Leave Means Leave in Solihull he wanted to scrap the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Nigel Farage be appointed as the representative, and that he be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had taken care of this, we would be out of the Union now, he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the Chequers plan".
He said: "We didn't fight in world wars to be subjected to anyone.
We want to uphold our rights in our own country.
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since voting in 2016: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely false".
There was also a Brexit supporter, Andrea Jenkins of the Tory Party, who told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will our party or our activists who are crowding the streets and who have elected us support it.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a statement to the Prime Minister, Mrs May added: "Prime Ministers hold their positions when they keep their promises".
Nigel Farage said that politicians taking part in the demonstration must feel hot if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us people and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do that.
Speaking to the excited crowd, he added: "I want you to make the politicians who are on the verge of betraying Brexit feel hot.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, anti-Brexit protesters marched through the city to the city centre, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved "Tory anti-Brexit" banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis laughed at the Conservatives over the security concerns of the party's app at the start of the conference.
These are people who claim they can organize computer systems and all the technology to support the Canada plus plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland, he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, a Democrat representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, with her opponent being Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
Now, it's being said that Warren could beat Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our failed government and she meant a woman at the top.
Arresting the perpetrator of the fatal shooting that killed LSU player Wayde Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday they've arrested a suspect in a Friday shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge police department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyson Simpson at a conference that took place at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
A video of the shooting was released Friday asking for help identifying the man who was seen on it.
20-year-old Wayde Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gunshot wound, killing him", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a weapon and shooting Wayde.
After an unresisting arrest, he was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Sheriff's Department.
The 6-foot-1, 195-pound Wayde Sims was raised in Baton Rouge, and played in 32 games, starting 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game on the court.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world title after team captain Sebastian Vettel won
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified against Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the direction of the Mercedes team would have a major impact on the outcome of the race.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two rounds and forcing Vettel to attack his team-mate.
Vettel drove down to the service point first and let Hamilton drive the tail of the peloton, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes competitor went into the next round of boxing and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-by-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctantly on the inside of the track, risking being pushed into the defense after a double-header to defend his position at the third turn, Hamilton set out to lead.
Max Verstappen started from the bottom of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap, he came in seventh place.
He then led for much of the race by not changing tyres to make a quick finish and taking Kimi Raikkonen out of fourth place.
He finally got to the service point on lap 44, but in the other eight laps he couldn't accelerate any more.
It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team did everything they could to take the top two places, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
During a meeting Saturday, President Donald Trump played with Senator Diana Feinstein, who maintained that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court Justice nominee Bret Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony of Christina Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were dirty, evil and lying.
"What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate we've been witnessing for days now, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying", he said.
We see what's been published and disclosed, and then they tell us, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you expose it?
Remember her answer... did you disclose the contents of this document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't tell her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Did we reveal... no, we didn't reveal the addition, by slaying the senator.
Diana Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September.
I didn't hide Dr. Ford's insinuation, I didn't reveal her story, Feinstein testified before the committee, reports The Hill.
She asked me to be discreet and I kept her secret.
But her statement did not convince the president, who said it at the meeting on Saturday: "I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
She may not have, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court justice candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use insinuations for their own ends.
They are determined to take power by any means necessary.
They show their wickedness, their malice, their indifference to who they hurt, who they must destroy to take power and control, the president said, Mediaite reports.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against Belfast Giants 5:3
In a game against Dundee Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants
The Dundee Stars have won their fifth Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning their home match 5:3 on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-point lead after the shots fired by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score, then Dwyer led the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard again tied the score, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third Elite League loss for Adam Keefe's underdogs, who, despite their initial loss on Friday night, lost 2-1 to Dundee in Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season. The Giants won their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) with Kendall McFaul helping out, and four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score with David Rutherford helping out.
After an intense 13:10 lead, Sullivan led the home team back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first quarter.
The hosts were re-grouped and Bouchard again tied the score with a goal scored in the game's lead of 27:37.
At the end of the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen to secure Dundee's first lead in the match, with Dundee's final victory sealed in the middle of the final half by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his side.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on board escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was hailed as a hero after he was killed helping a plane with hundreds of people on board take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The region is still experiencing strong seismic shocks, and many people are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palos.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the splendid flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Pal.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air flight (Flight 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to fall.
He died in the hospital.
According to Australian news agency ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller's decision likely saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Borneo, to be transferred to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"This message broke our hearts", he added.
The National Disaster Management Agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
'We believe the death toll is still rising because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,' said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
A six-meter-wide tsunami has devastated Palau, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are constantly bringing bodies.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help survivors, but we don't know what we'll think about it.
It's a tragedy, and it could be worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau, and he addressed the military: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
This year, an earthquake has already struck Indonesia, killing more than 550 people on Lombok Island.
Air Niugini reports one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Airlines operating the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Micronesia report that one person is missing, and earlier claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that the data on Saturday afternoon showed no one man was able to be counted on the feral plane.
They said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport, local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six other passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the disaster, nor is the exact course of the disaster known.
The United States Air Force and Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
"It's been a big help", he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water reaching the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue operation was also assisted by sailors working nearby to modernize the coastline, who were able to use a blown-out boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of them are Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office completed the evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
For hours, the U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in information analysis in court.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to recreate the trajectory of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she was killed.
As reported by Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that the feral night Tellis was with Chambers, thus disproving his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was allegedly staying with his friend Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth about staying in a Sanford truck that night, he said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he's known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers Tellis died, she deleted her phone's contact information, as well as her text messages and calls.
"He was wiping her out of his life", Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin Sunday.
The judge said the case would likely be referred to the jury that same day.
The High Breed  What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
According to Bristol-based band The High Breed, today's hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social content.
The band members want to get back to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
The work of artists like Akala and Lowkey has recently seen a revival in the UK of artists like The Fugees and Common.

New York nanny sues a couple for parole after a racist text message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for firing her from her racist job after receiving a mis-adressed text message in which the child's mother complains that she is a black person.
The couple denies they're racist, comparing the lawsuit to blackmail.
The mother of two, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly dismayed when it was revealed that her new caregiver, Giselle Maurice, who was hanging out on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
A black woman wrote a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman learned of the crime, she freed Gisella Maurice, claiming that the kindly African-American nanny was doing her duties poorly and that she was expecting a Filipino nanny.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now she's claiming compensation from the couple for a $350 daily discharge multiplied by the six months she was originally employed with the residence, although she didn't sign the contract.
I want to show them that this is not the way to do things", she told the Post on Friday, adding that she knew it was discrimination.
The couple denies the accusations of racism, saying that the termination of their relationship with Ms. Maurice was justified because after being insulted, they feared they could not trust her.
My wife sent her something she wasn't going to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, " her husband, Joel Plasco, told Post.
Would you entrust your children to someone you have hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
- What?
Comparing the lawsuit to blackmail, Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
Are you going to blow something like this?
That's not very nice, the investment banker added.
Although the case was not over, the public quickly issued a verdict on social media, criticizing her behavior and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington books were worried that readers would not feel connected to the talking bear
Author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's warm reception, says of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person who first read it, even before the book was published.
It's very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington's great success.
She claims that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, was certain that his work would be rejected.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family, she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
He was a quiet man, not a boastful man, he adds.
But because Paddington seemed so real to him, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something, you feel proud of him, even though it's not your fault.
I think that's how Paddington saw his success.
Although he invented it himself, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn't get out", says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say Natasha was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart rate going slowly stopped working and were eliminated from her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it.
All I could do was sit back and wait, knowing that it was all coming together.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to stick with it.
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the suffering she was going through.
No one knew she said.
I had my head down, and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a great deal of compassion for Nada on the plane.
I felt that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
The letters from the women in mourning are meant to help prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put up inspirational postcards and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge to help people.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he developed depression and took his own life at 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day.
Sharon Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could light up every room.
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the effects of dominance.
Sharon Davis created these cards to tell people that there are people you can talk to, even if they're just friends.
Don't sit still, talk to someone.
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
Nobody said he was feeling beat up or sad or anything.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was in a complete hole, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them.
He says his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: "It's making a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.

The future of Bret Kavanaugh hangs in the balance because the FBI is investigating.
I thought that if we could actually get what the investigation was asking for, a limited time and scope, maybe we could reach some consensus, Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was worried the committee would break up into opposing camps, leading to a deadlock.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
The congressional elections are just weeks away on November 6th, and if the Republicans lose, as predicted, the chances of electing a specific person to the nation's highest court will be significantly reduced.
George W. Bush was already raising his phone to call the senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is going to have a vote.
It's not clear if Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 Senate votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and take him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to South Korean lawmakers, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Park Byeong-seug said that there were 1127 escapes last year, and in 2011 there were 2,706.
He said that the key factors that have influenced this situation are closer border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are ultimately being offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
The Chinese consider refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often force them back into the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still theoretically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that had previously stalled.
This was after the historic meeting of US President Donald Trump with Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, which resulted in a general agreement on the goal of clearing the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not making progress on the issue.
'Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and under these circumstances there is no possibility of unilaterally disarming ourselves first,' Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh a "hysteric" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Bret Kavanaugh a "historian" and said he was not, by nature, fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I think if a woman behaved like this, she would be considered a 'hysterical' person", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
For a few moments during his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional. He almost screamed and lost his voice when discussing family matters and high school years.
He also sharply denounced the Democrats on the committee, citing accusations of grotesque and coordinated reputational assault by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it exposed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
I think he disqualified himself from making those statements, and also from the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats, she said.
Asked if she would seek Kavanaugh's removal from office if he received the nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
I'll say this: If he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only be sitting on the Supreme Court, but he should be in office in the court he's currently working for.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she's worried about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he's considered a conservative judge.
During the affirmative hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is no time to bring to justice a hysterical, biased person who will expect us to say she's wonderful", Pelosi added.
And women must rule it.
It's a right diatribes, months and years of raging rage, and she can't shake it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
I guess it's pretty common, right?
She added: "A woman who was a manager at a company helped me a lot, and she said that she cries when she's angry, too, but she's figured out a way to say to the person she's talking to that when she gets angry and starts crying, 'You probably think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are acceptable as a way to express anger in part because they are misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office is when I once started crying out of an unspoken rage, and an older woman, a cold driver, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed my neck and took me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you're taken care of.
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with his girlfriend on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Frustrated over the borders Patricia realized she might well consider running for president herself.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates up for election, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone described this situation as "Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was lagging behind in raising funds and promised herself that she would not enter the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle to lose.
She discovered that some of her followers, who gave men $1,000, only had $250 for her.
Do they think I have any discounts?
During her speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion  gratitude for those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and address voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism that her voice caught her in the throat.
You might think I had a nervous breakdown.
You might think I'm sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my grave.
She cried?
What benefits can an economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing
The fallout from the US-China economic war has been daunting, and while the battle is still ongoing, the conflict between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by US President Donald Trump, who imposed tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came after new tariffs were imposed on $200 billion worth of goods (£150 billion), which resulted in half of all goods entering the US from China being taxed.
Each time Beijing has responded in kind, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to 10 percent.
China is determined to respond to every blow from the United States, and the world's second largest economy does not look set to collapse anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing your head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for economic chaos in one of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have admitted", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready for the return of refugees
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moualem, said conditions in the country were improving.
"The situation in our region is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met for refugees who have been forced to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods to return to it voluntarily.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional or state aid offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the USA team by 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, it scored 14.5 points, which was needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was not doing well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has been a fixture in all competitions and is one of only four players to have scored 5-0-0 since the tournament was first held in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated by a score of 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorne Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is the top ranked player in the world, lost two holes to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been the last Ryder Cup winner.
The European with the most Ryder Cup wins is Spanish Sergio Garcia, who has competed in eight of those tournaments and scored 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I'm so glad I got my cup back.
It's a success for the whole team and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, moved after the European team's victory.
He's handing the bat to his compatriot, John Rahm, who on Sunday beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game, 2&1.
"I'm incredibly proud of winning with Tiger Woods.
Woods has lost every game in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an unprecedented statistic, like one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and lost to Jack Nicklaus.
The United States team had been struggling to find a trainer all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American squad, its captain, Jim Furyk, said, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we squeezed some Europeans.
We're backing off.
Head-butt in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We're gonna change the composition of the group, and together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we're gonna find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us.
Flowering information  in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota Plankton density decreases
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton densification in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of the spotted squid has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches for about 209 kilometers of coastline from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The wreckage can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than the previous week.
The flower has also been seen in Pasco County.
Last week, there were average levels of plankton on the coast and in the waters of Pinellas County, low to medium on the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high on the coast and in the waters of Sarasota County, natural to medium in Charlotte County, natural to high on the coast and in the waters of Lee County, and low in Collier County.
There are still reported cases of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
But last week, there were no reported cases in northwest Florida.
