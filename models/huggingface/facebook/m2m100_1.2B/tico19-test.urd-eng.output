The overall spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Economic Area and the UK has increased rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Similar trends are being shown in the combined spread of cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Economic Area and the UK, while the global spread of COVID-19 in all countries is accelerating at different stages based on the country.
Based on Italian experience, several countries, hospitals and extreme surveillance units should increase their preparation in order to increase the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients because they will need surveillance especially extreme surveillance.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of unknown cause sampling were in Wuhan, China’s province of Hubei.
On 9 January 2020, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention that the causative agent is the neurocoronavirus now known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Historical evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections, with or without sampling, and most of them are recovering.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 occurs in cases of more severe illness, which requires hospitalization, while in 6% of cases those suffering from severe illness require extreme care.
COVID-19 death rates in hospitals are around 4 percent.
In this study, we will evaluate trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/EEA and the UK and compare them to the province of Ho Chi Minh City in China.
We also compare the recent number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread more geographically, and the global trend of COVID-19 in the rest of the world is now in line with the same country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global disease.
In the Euro Surveillance data of March 5, 2020, Spartak Ethal the first European-certified cases of COVID-19 according to the WHO case appreciation.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were by three French citizens returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and today, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Acquire aggregate data and aggregate spread of COVID-19 cases
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) has data on COVID-19 cases in every country around the world only from official sources, the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to review and compare COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK with trends in Italy.
As a result of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the total spread of COVID-19 for 14 days, observing the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We compared with Italy over the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020, providing aggregate data for each country’s cases up to 8:00 a.m. on 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Generally speaking, the 14-day total spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is according to the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall spread of COVID-19 began to increase on 21 February and then accelerated on 28 February 2020.
This was due to a rapid increase in the number of cases mostly from Italy, but the combined spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar rising trends.
Figure 2 shows the total number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK compared with Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It was highlighted that, as of March 15, at 8:00 a.m., just 3 weeks before or less, the total number of cases in the other 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK were first compared to Italy.
Our results indicate a rapid increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observed trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 indicate that the global web is growing at a comparable rate in all countries.
Although countries are at different stages, changes in national health response and potentially different protocols for the assessment of cases and patient selection in countries, including cache testing, need to be tested for COVID-19 validation.
In early March 2020, doctors from the affected areas of Italy a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed extreme surveillance and sources that hospitals and extreme surveillance units in those areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, for EU/EEA level %6 and %1 cases respectively, data on COVID-19 incidents are available in any hospital and/or extreme surveillance unit (data not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the completion of cases and the number of deaths, should be collected in an organized manner.
A study conducted in 2010-11 showed that in Europe there were major changes in the availability of highly supervised and intermediate supervised residences from 29.2 per 100,000 in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have fewer and fewer resources such as Italy (11 in 2010 there are 12.5 extreme and intermediate surveillance beds for every 100,000 population).
The modeling scenario for increased health care capabilities, estimates of cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in each EU/EEA country and the UK that are associated with anxiety of > 90% in excess of the funding of the high-risk bed, are provided in the ECDC’s Fast-Risk Assessment Update on COVID-19.
Since there are currently cases listed in EU/EEA countries and specific regions of the UK, and as a rule, hospitals and highly observed units describe the population of the regional area, the Priority Data 2 (NUTS-2) for information on cases and places of extreme observation facilitates the available numeration of regional units.
Current trends in Italy and other countries show that the global web of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading across the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and extreme surveillance units should prepare themselves for the independent community transfer of SARS-CoV-2, and the increase in patients with COVID-19 such as the affected areas of Italy requires health surveillance especially extreme surveillance.
As the recent ECDC accelerated stress assessment, I have pointed out the need for an accelerated, active and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, which has been correlated with changes in discounting perspectives from preventing, if it is not implemented in advance, the anticipated rapid increase in cases will not provide decision makers and hospitals with enough time to understand, recognize and cover their reactions accordingly.
A list of public health measures has also been put in place to reduce the worldwide impact of Ebola in acute stress assessment.
Here is a small opportunity for countries to increase their efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health surveillance.
As a result of this failure, it is likely that health surveillance systems in EU/EEA countries will face the need for extreme surveillance due to an increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The most severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), due to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and affected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in devastating human health.
Like its homologous virus SARS-Cov, which in 2003 caused SARS in thousands of people, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread through skin cells and causes the same symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality rates compared to SARS, but it affects older adults and men more than adolescents.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications about recurrent disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly evolving research article.
We will cover the basics of web disease, virology, biology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and disease prevention.
Although many questions need to be answered right now, we hope this review will help us understand this dangerous disease and end it.
The 25 January 2020 Spring Festival has become an unparalleled and unforgettable memory for all Chinese residents due to the spread of viral disease and the emphasis on all holidays and many weeks of living in homes.
This virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV) which caused the spread of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003.Therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its associated disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
It began in the city of Wuhan in China and quickly spread across the country and around 50 other countries around the world.
By March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is "the enemy number one of the people" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, which includes its virology, pathology, causes, treatment and diagnosis since its first report on 7 January 2020 and which has determined to differentiate several patients.
This review sought to summarize the creative progress in the new and rapidly evolving topic sector.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with the disease caused by SARS and another CoV, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS spreading in 2012).
We will talk about what has been learned so far about the diagnosis and prevention of this disease, as well as some important questions remaining so far.
For humans, CoV has traditionally been regarded as non-sensitive petogens, primarily causing about 15% of the general downsides of 4.
However, in this century, we had two extremely dangerous CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, which produced this virus in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively, and soon this terrifying disease spread to many other countries with its rate of death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 virus is the third COVID virus in recorded human history.
As shown in the figure, Figure 1.1, about the sampling of scabies whose origins are unknown, was first in the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, CoV was set up.
On January 15, 2020, the first John Levy case took place in Wuhan.
They were divided into two cities, two towns and two towns.
On January 20, health care workers the infection, meaning it could be transmitted from human to human.
On January 23, it was locked down by shutting down all public transportation in the city of Wuhan.
On 24 January, a first medical study on the disease that only 21 out of 41 confirmed cases of patients were directly connected to the ocean food market, which is considered the starting point of the infection through an unknown animal.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and 50 countries around the world (Fig. 2).
As the situation is rapidly becoming, therefore the final financial and intensity of the vibe remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, on 8,866 patients, including 4,021 COVID-19-certified patients, another latest description of this disease was described in a multiplex study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30 years.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those affected were over 50 years of age, at least 20 years of age and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 affects more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in the Hobby and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 was diagnosed on average 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days
The average time from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic production number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82
According to the time of mass transportation before the spring meltdown in China, the number of people affected before 23 June 2020 increased rapidly.
The patient mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% Cl: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% Cl: 2.02-4.59%)
The three major dangerous elements of COVID-19 were gender (man), age (≥60), and severe sampling.
CoVs is a subfamily of large and multifaceted viruses, which is a compound of sensory RNA.
They are divided into four generations, Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta, of which Alpha and Beta-CoVs go to affect humans.
Melfop spike (S) glucoprotein binds to its cellular receptor inhibitor converter enzymes 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptide 4 (DPP4) respectively to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then produces the fusion of the spike.
Viral genes are released into the cytoplasma, then after viral genes are transferred, genes with RNA make a version containing melophobic glucose methylates and neo-chloric acid, which then fuse with the plasma to leave the virus.
The first genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98% of the 10 samples collected from the original location of the Huan seafood market in Wuhan identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of beta.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are more common than SARS-CoV.
As a result of the electron microscopy transfer, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found on the extremely narrow portion of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2, but also for SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 has been linked to human ACE2 in a more vulnerable way than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV causes less infection than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form encrypted encrypted encrypted by orf3b and orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play its role in Pyongyang City and express itself in IFNB, but there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao Etal a complex resolution in EM structures at a full length of 2.9 Å with human ACE2 with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexity, in which open and closed changes were combined as a dimmer and ACE2-B0AT1 complexity could bind two S-metallic, which ignore CoVK identification and evidence of infection.
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be treated by B0AT1 for prescription drug screening.
Original and Blood Representative
It is well-known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both starting from the skeletons, have been transmitted to humans through sewage buds and eggs.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the skin is considered to be a local representative of SARS-CoV-2, because the new virus is similar to the two SARS-like SARS-like CoVs BET-SL-CoVZX45 and BET-SL-COVZX21.
However, it has not yet been known, which intermediate representative has helped to cross the obstacles to affect humans, and the path of transition can not be explained.
G, Yat, L, had suggested that spiders take them from skulls to humans as a virus infectant, which includes homologous restoration within the S-protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, have suggested that long-sunned penguins, chanty-eating almonds, peguins, and 99% of genetic homosexualities found in SARS-CoV-2 that are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine could be potential intermediate representatives of SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% spread difference between the two genomes is still very large, and the final results of comprehensive evidence are also awaiting (Fig. 33).
Most of SARS-CoV-2’s biochemical properties are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVwho can survive for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and less than 20 ° C and up to 5 days in moisture of up to 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 also has similar features.
SARS-CoV-2 has been to be sensitive to elevated spotting cranes, and heat of 56°C for up to 30 minutes, or to 75 % ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, parasic acid, chlorophorm, and other fatty bacteria, but chlorhexidine cannot effectively deactivate this virus.
Generally speaking, the entire human population has a lack of strength support for SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the virus.
Currently, no detailed study of the defensive reaction of SARS-CoV-2 has been.
Thus, we can refer to previous studies on other CoVs in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4.4).
Typically, when a virus attacks a representative, the representative’s defense system recognizes it through first-type receptors (PRRs), which include type C leptin-mouse receptors, thalmouse receptors (TLRs), nadomose receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-mouse receptors (RLRs).
Through various methods, the virus stimulates inflammatory factors, the maturation of dental cells, and the combination of number I-type interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and stimulate its antiviral genes to accelerate microphage fagocytosis.
However, SARS-CoV's N-virus may help prevent defensive reactions.
Soon, consensus defensive response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including +CD4 and +CD8 play an important role in cell defense.
To produce specific antibodies related to the virus, +CD4 T cells stimulate B cells and +CD8 T cells directly kill the cells affected by the virus.
T-helper cells produce pro-burning site cells to assist defensive cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the function of T cells by injecting T cells into the epithelium.
Hormonal strength support including C3a and C5a and antibody metabolisms are essential to combat viral infection.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by antibodies separated from the patient.
On the other hand, as a result of violations of the strength-support system, many free radicals are produced locally that can damage muscles and other organs, and, at worst, many organs can stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is pronounced from the beginning of clustering, and it is more likely to affect elderly and pregnant women.
This is common in people who have two or four viruses in large numbers, or whose defensive function is weak, such people are more likely to be affected than others.
Based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated growth duration of SARS-CoV-2 is on average 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average growth duration ranges from 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
As outlined above, a recent study shows that the growth period based on 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective timing of the coronavirus based on the most appropriate period of growth so that people who are affected but do not show symptoms can be protected from the transmission of the virus.
Usually, people with or affected by the virus need to be vaccinated for 14 days.
Should the period of incubation be extended to 24 days?
Often COVID-19’s primary and initial symptom is vomiting, with which there are no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry eating, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, coughing, headache, discomfort in the throat, knee, chest pain, constipation, methyl and altitude.
Some patients have to experience breathing and/or shock quality one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have severe respiratory syndrome, septic shocks, metabolic acceleration, and an immediate improvement in freezing.
Patients with vomiting and/or breathing symptoms and severe vomiting, even contrary to normal pulmonary imaging, should be tested for initial diagnosis.
A population study at the end of December 2019 found that 98% of people with oatmeal, 76% of people with dry food, 55% of people with respiratory symptoms and 3% of patients with heartburn need ventilation assistance.
In two recent studies, similar findings have emerged about the cause of a disorder through domestic disorder and non-symptomatic transfer from an individual.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had primary symptoms of vomiting (%98) and drying of the stomach (%47) and breathing (%55).
However, 80% of these patients needed ventilation, were much more likely to suffer from COVID-19 and were more susceptible to MERS than COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced constipation (%26) and throat inflammation (%21).
It has been shown that patients with SARS have symptoms of vomiting (100-99 percent), drying of the stomach (75-29 percent), breathing (42-40 percent), constipation (25-20 percent) and throat inflammation (25-13 percent) and approximately 20-14 percent of patients need ventilation assistance.
By 14 February, when the number of confirmed cases globally reached 66,576 cases, the death rate in COVID-19 was 2%.
By November 2002, the death rate for 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS was 10%.
Based on a population survey in June 2012, the mortality rate in 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study that SARS-CoV-2’s R0 productivity was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 while SARS-CoV’s R0 productivity was only 2 to 4.
Table 1.1 compares SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, mortality rates and production numbers with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less susceptible than both subsequent viruses.
So, overcoming SARS-CoV-2 is more difficult than overcoming MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Most crashes begin with the same family, or the same gathering or ride, such as a boat.
Most patients have traveled or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas in the last two weeks before the onset, or had contact with affected persons or patients.
However, it has been that people can keep the virus inside for two weeks without showing symptoms, and patients who recover from the hospital can be exposed to the virus again, which increases the time of cancer.
These patients found lower or equal white blood cells at initial levels (especially lymphocytes).
For example, the number of white blood cells < 4×109/L in lymphocyte containing the number of lymphocyte sites < 1×109/L, and 1,099 patients with COVID-19 found levels of spread amino transmission and viremia.
Some patients' liver and muscles increased the levels of myoglobin in the blood and muscles, and most patients' blood increased C-inactivated hemoglobin and atherosclerosis.
In patients with severe cases, the D-diameter in the blood, the lack of phosphorus, increased, so the number of lymph sites slowly decreased.
In contrast to the usual characteristics of COVID-19 patients’ chest radiographs, a two-sided complex shadow or a dampened pen appears in the pimples.
Most patients develop common sampling, severe muscle disorder, severe respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
Respiratory impotence syndrome, unbearable inflammation, accumulation of salivary matter and increasing fiber gas exchange.
The inactivation of type I and type II neurotransmitters reduces the level of the head factor and increases the level of fluidity, thereby reducing the risk of spreading and failing.
Therefore, the results of the worst radiography of the breasts are comparable to the extreme range of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, neomycytes, hyaluronic gland formation, and median lymphocyte infestation, and multicellular synesthetic cells appeared in patients dying from the disease in the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 according to SARS and MERS patients and the pathology of ARDS and viral infection.
The reverse transcript polymers-chine reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of COVID-19 was a key criterion for using SARS-CoV-2 RNA for detection.
In China on 13 February 2020, due to the higher rate of negative lies, which can accelerate the web, medical data was started to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
This was also the case with SARS.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, the history of the disease, medical descriptions, laboratory tests, and radiological results must all be included.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Shui Group outlined a protocol for using CRISPR-based shell technology for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which will use deposits from 20x10-18 micro-liter/liter to 200x10-18 micro-liter/liter (100-10 copies per micro-liter per injection) in less than an hour without the need for devices.
Hopefully, if confirmed in medical samples, the new technology will dramatically increase sensitivity and ease.
Due to the lack of experience with Nol CoV, therapists can primarily provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19 while also attempting different therapies that were previously recommended or used for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table2).
These treatments include recent and potentially antiviral medicines, amyoprosthesis, steroids, plasma of healthy patients, Chinese medicine and psychiatric assistance.
Even healthy patients’ plasma was recommended to use for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in the race to develop antibody and vaccine against the virus.
In the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks fungus, and other organs expressing ACE2 in small amounts such as mines and kidneys.
However, respiratory impairment and fungal failure are the greatest causes of danger and death for the patient.
Therefore, to help with breathing to eliminate symptoms and save lives, the severity of the disease includes general oxygen, rapid flow oxygen, non-interference ventilation and mechanically interfering ventilation.
Patients with severe disorders in the respiratory system must be assisted by the use of corrected cardiopulmonary bias techniques to treat patients at risk of heart visit or failure to breathe through the ECMO.
In addition, for electrolight care, secondary infection and septic injury treatment and prevention are essential for the protection of vital organ function in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is said that in patients with SARS and MERS, the resulting violation of the defensive system results in cytokine strain.
The cytokine stream is a type of organised inflammatory reaction that is produced by a sequential execution of cytokine including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
To release a large number of free radicals, which are the major cause of severe distress syndrome in the respiratory system and failure of various organs, these cytokines include defensive cells.
Immunosuppression is necessary for the treatment of cytokine streams, especially in severe patients.
Corticobacter indes and tocyzomabic anti-IL6 molecular antibody have been used for the treatment of cytokine stroke.
Other supports of the cytokine stream in the treatment of pressure; IFN-y,IL-1 and TNF were blocked; JAK was blocked; motor cell pressure 4; and HADC was blocked, including the directed modification of the T cell of the defensive reaction.
The steroid was widely used as an amino spray as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in SARS.
However, heavy doses of steroids in fungal disease in patients with SARS and COVID-19 were not beneficial.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially affecting the diagnosis of avascular osteonecrosis in a dramatic way.
Nevertheless, severe patients with COVID-19 are recommended to use with caution short courses of multi-dose corticosteroids.
To date, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, in the case of an American patient with COVID-19, neocleotide AnaLog was found to be effective with a stroke relapse in the stomach.
Remicade is an anti-viral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlberg viruses.
Subsequently, Remicade was potentially blocked to block other single RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead provided China with a compound of it for a pair of trials on people affected by SARS-CoV-2, with results much higher than expected.
In addition, patients with severe symptoms of shortness of breath have been prescribed barecitabine, interferon-a, lupenovirus/retonovirus, and rabaviren as possible treatments.
In combination with lupenovirus/retonovirus treatment may result in diarrhea, caia, methyl, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The combination of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be monitored with caution.
Healthy patients and antibody generation plasma
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients who recover from this multiple disease to treat other patients with this disease or save healthy people from this disease.
In fact, most healthy patients have relatively higher amounts of antibodies against pyrogen in their blood.
Antibody is an amyoglobin (Ig) that through B-limofytes helps to fight peto genes and other external things and identify unique molecules on the peto and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 severe patients.
Their symptoms such as burning and viral load and blood oxygen deficiency improve within 24 hours.
However, no specific treatment has yet been developed, so it is necessary to confirm and clarify it before it is recommended to use on a large scale.
In addition, while looking at the effects of treatment, some damage associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies enhance defensive reactions, and can cause sitokoene execution syndrome, which is possibly John Levi's syndrome.
Generally, the number of antibodies in the blood decreases, and the demand for plasma for treatment of severe patients increases.
It is difficult to prepare a specific antibody so quickly to fight the World Wide Web.
Separating B cells from patients and screening effective antibodies against the genetic code identification of the virus’s essential infection to encode effective anti-inflammation is a delicate and difficult process.
This way we can speed up the antibody preparation process.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various diseases.
However, its effects depend largely on a multi-component compound in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or unknown because such ingredients or their best combination are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the Zhou Feng Ghui Capsule and Li Hong Chang Wen Capsule Car have been proven to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.
In several provinces of China, COVID-19 patients, including Guangzhou (63.7 per cent), Nigeria (50 per cent), and Han(50 per cent), saw a higher rate of improvement in their treatment using 87 per cent of traditional Chinese medicine, while the Hubei province, which used traditional Chinese medicine in only 30 per cent of their COVID-19 patients, had the lowest rate of health recovery (13 per cent).
However, this is quite a tough comparison, as the effects of this analysis should also include many other factors such as the number and severity of patients.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study on the comparison of Western medicine (WM) treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that compared to only the Western medicine group, Western medicine + traditional Chinese medicine group was unusually shorter than the required time to restore physical temperature, eliminate symptoms, and stay in the hospital.
Most impressively, the symptomatically increasing sign (slightly severe) was low in the WM group alone compared to the WM+TCM group (4.6 percent compared to 7.4 percent) and the mortality rate (3.9 percent compared to 8.8 percent) was abnormally low.
Nevertheless, traditional Chinese medicine is still expecting better and more controlled trials of its performance and protection in larger and larger centres.
It will be interesting to identify the process of treating traditional Chinese medicine, to describe their effective components or, if possible, to describe their combination.
Patients who are suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 are mostly afraid of extreme multiple and even contagious illnesses, and people with cardiovascular disorders experience bullying, loneliness and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as vomiting, shocks, and starvation, as well as carotenoid steroids can cause adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia, more drowsiness and mental distress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients received reports of constant mental pressure, anxiety, anxiety attacks, psychological agitation, psychological symptoms, depression and suicide.
Identifying and curing COVID-19 as a part of public health can make people more careless and guilty about the effects of stress, curing and body harassment affecting their family and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them, as well as general people who also need mental health monitoring should be provided.
Psychological assistance should consist of establishing clear communications with constant and accurate updates on the use of multi-functional mental health teams, SARS-CoV-2 and its treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Vaccination should be effective in preventing the transmission link from affected animals and people to sensitive representatives, and often antiviral treatment is necessary to overcome the onset of the virus.
Efforts have been made to develop S-Carbon-based vaccines to produce long-term and vent-neutralizing antibody and/or protective strength support against SARS.
Vaccinations that directly affect animal samples for SARS were analyzed.
However, the usefulness of these vaccine candidates in protecting adults, malignant challenges samples and animal viral infection can not be corrected before medical studies have begun.
This is because SARS ended 17 years ago and no new case has yet been.
In contrast, in other regions besides the Middle East where there are areas with independent sources of animal viruses, the series of MERS viruses to be detected continues.
Vaccination strategies have been developed to deactivate viruses, protect against MERS using DNA plasma, viral vectors, nano particles, viruses-like particles and recycled molecular subunits, and some of these have been tested on animal samples.
Preparation for a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-protective individuals is an urgent and important task to overcome the ongoing outbreak.
However, overcoming this difficulty is a challenge due to the need for long periods (at least 18 months) for the preparation of the vaccine and the dynamic changes of the CoVs.
COVID-19 has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients as a neural disease.
In most cases, the patient can gradually recover without any connection.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with more illness and death in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, health surveillance agencies need to establish disease diagnostic models to prioritize their services in areas with low resources.
Based on previously medical studies, the following factors may be associated with the diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 or their incidence (Table 33).
Age: Age was the most important factor for diagnosing SARS, which is now also valid for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affected people aged 65-30 years, with 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the study described above being over 50 years of age.
Patients who are more likely to have primary hypertensive complications are more vulnerable to extreme surveillance, and are more vulnerable than those who do not have such complications (51 years rather than the average age of 66), who offer age as a diagnostic procedure for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As described above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
Retention and Complications: Patients with COVID-19 who need extreme care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory infections.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2 positive cholecystitis, which can cause liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It is reasonable that age and the underlying disease are strongly linked and can interfere with each other.
Laboratory Outcomes: The level of C reactivated hemoglobin (CRP) present in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been suggested as a possible analytical procedure for the treatment response and final recovery of the disease.
The C-reactive hemorrhoidal level association has been recommended for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
In addition, Elevated Lactate de Hydro Genes (LDH), Spray Aminotransmitters (AST), Ala-Nine Aminotransmitters (ALT), and Cretein Kenas can also help predict results.
The expression of these seeds occurs in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and they come out through tissue damage.
It is the heart or the heart of the wicked.
Key Medical Symptoms: Temporary improvement in breast radiography and medical symptoms should be considered in combination with other tests to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroid support pressures are commonly used to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage as a supportive treatment in multiple diseases.
Since large amounts of carotenoid steroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors experienced avascular osteoncerosis with age-long disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, patients with COVID-19 should use very small amounts of steroids for a short period of time.
Mental impairment: As outlined above, many patients during the COVID-19 epidemic experienced unusual impairments due to long-term intolerance to heartburn and observing the irrational deaths of close relatives and fellow patients.
These patients need psychological counseling and long-term assistance to restore and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies done so far, it seems that COVID-19’s web characteristics are different from SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can also stick to the upper tubes of the breath, in addition to sticking to the lower tubes of the breath, and cause mild or no symptoms, such as common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, in the early stages or during the growth period, affected patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which makes it very difficult to overcome this tissue.
However, the delivery of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is severely ill, whereas in the initial stage there is no more delivery.
In comparison to SARS, COVID-19 is far more severe and difficult to overcome.
At the same time, in China, hopes and efforts continue to disrupt the transition of SARS-CoV-2 in the cities of Wuhan and the vicinity of Lockdown and the entire population.
Although these measures are damaging the domestic economy and other sectors in a dramatic way, it is reducing the number of new patients, indicating a slowdown in tuberculosis.
The most delightful thing is that the web will end in March and its duo swing phase will be in 3 to 4 months.
However, some other experts do not have such hopes.
Paul Hunter, Ethan, has estimated that COVID-19, which seems to be a much more multiplex disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
ARA LONGE ETAL, establishing a model for predicting the outcomes of global WPA, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A group in Canada that patients who had recovered from the hospital two weeks earlier learned from mid-trichin and throat symptoms that they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be the trigger of influenza.
However, based on the decrease in the number of new cases, there are promising indications in China, indicating that the current strategy is working.
Ebola killed half a million people.
However, through severe carnations and isolation, the disease was finally overcome.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is also weak in spreading the affected disease and eventually ends up or remains present with humans like a less-infected virus.
The following form compares COVID-19 to SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted by swallowing or scratching and potentially by direct contact with a virus-infected substance.
This virus is also found in the spleen, which creates the possibility of transferring it from the spleen to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41 percent of cases were potentially caused by non-neurological infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, people, especially health care providers, social workers, householders, partners and even those in contact with patients or affected persons should be very careful.
To reduce the risk of infection, the first step of defense is to wear a mask on the face; the use of both the circular mask and the N95 respiratory mask (Series # 1860s) helps to overcome the spread of the virus.
The surgical mask prevents any potentially affected person from traveling through the air or splashing on the surfaces of objects, from where they can reach others.
However, only the N95 (Series #1860) mask alone can prevent 10 to 80 nm from engaging in the breathing of small wires, only 5 percent of the wires can enter completely,SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, both about 85 nm.
Although five surgical masks are coupled together, the particles can still penetrate them, so those who are in direct contact with patients should wear N95 (Series #1860s) masks.
In addition to the masks, those who care for health should wear separate clothes to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also affect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing the N95 mask; often the virus entered through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, those who care for health should wear a clear blanket on the face when working with patients.
It is strongly advised for people in affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with toxic soap, to try to curb themselves inside the home and to limit contact with potentially affected people.
The distance to the patient is 3 feet.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is highly homogeneous to SARS-CoV, according to a report released on 7 January 2020, and should cause a high rate for China based on the deep remembrance of the 2003 SARS spread.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Center for the Control of Wuhan’s Disease reassured citizens that the virus has a low multiplicity and limited productive capacity in humans and that preventing and overcoming the disease is not a problem.
The message calmed the public’s alarm, especially when they were preparing for the Spring Festival, and wasted time to overcome the disease to a minimum in Wuhan.
Agencies dealing with diseases in China may have learned from this difficulty to bring significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be cautious when making public announcements as each word matters to citizens and can change their behaviors and decisions; (2) be sensitive to and react to clinical routine information instead of warning official reports from doctors or relatives; (3) ban the overcoming of potential waves in their early stages rather than reassuring the public; and (4) use targeting and influencing practices to increase public awareness about web diseases frequently and timely to test and improve the system of reaction of society.
COVID-19’s outbreak began in December 2019 via SARS-CoV-2.
The service release, in less than two months, spread across China and around 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is transmitted to SARS-CoV and the symptoms between COVID-19 and SARS are also transmitted, the spread of COVID-19 has created a sense of re-expanding SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the maintenance of the tissue and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults and women more than adolescents and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older adults than adolescents.
SARS has a higher mortality rate compared to COVID-19 (compared to 10.91% to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are severely ill, which makes it harder to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads relatively faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have regular RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, the virus may be positive once again in healthy patients.
These results increase the fear of spreading the virus in a dramatic manner.
In view of rapid progress in the investigation of COVID-19, a number of key problems are now left to be solved, such as the following:
What is SARS-CoV-2?
Although SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoV bits are 96 percent genetically identified, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from the skin.
The original representative, from the skin, who was the middle species of virus transmission in humans?
Without the response to # 1 and 2, we cannot effectively reduce the transfer process and it can spread again at any time.
Although biological modeling and biochemical testing show that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does this virus enter the respiratory tract cells and how pathological changes result?
Does the virus also interfere with ACE2 expressing cells in other members?
Without correct answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this continue?
How does the virus genetically develop during transplantation in humans?
Will it become a global wave, end up like SARS, or continue to run out of time like a burden?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, there are expenses on it, and we have no problem but to quickly stop this web and bring our life back to normal.
Animal sources of human coronavirus
For thousands of years, change and consensus has advanced the mutual growth of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host animals, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronaviruses (HCoVs) went to common colds such as mild disease C.
The Serious Respiratory Disorder System (SARS) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory System (MERS) have been researched to show how devastating and life-threatening the HCoV infection can be.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and surprised us by its faster transition and decrease in pyogenesis compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an infection transmitted from animals to humans and it serves us to understand the animal source of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originate from skins where they are non-pyrogenic.
Some HCoVs inventory intermediate hosts are also known to be alive.
Identify host animals that directly affect the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating CoV-hosted organisms in animals gives important insights into petogenesis CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of existing knowledge about seven HCoVs, in which we focus on the date of their discovery as well as the origin and transition of their animal species.
Importantly, we compare and patent different HCoVs from the perspective of promoting different viruses and restoring their genes.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be discussed in the context.
In addition, successful hosts have highlighted the impact of preventing the virus on the changes in animal requirements and the severity of the disease.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of hypofyses, positive senses, and single trapped RNA viruses.
These viruses, using large genes such as 26 to 32 kilograms base between RNA viruses, were called "CoV" due to the appearance of coronary morphology from the electronic microscope.
Structurally, CoVs are non-divided genes that participate in a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of genes consist of two large open frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polarity chart of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polar metals introduces an additional 16 non-structural metals, named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genes include ORFs for structural chemicals, including Nuclear(S), Melophop(E), Zelyma (M) and New Kilo (N).
A large number of specific chain support mines are also encoded through different chain CoVs.
Based on differences in coherence settings, CoVs are classified into four generations (Alpha-CoV, Beta-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV), where the Beta-CoV generation mostly contains HCoVs and is divided into further generations (A,B,C and D).
Evidence of phylogenic genes revealed that the majority of skulls and cattle are sources of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV genes, while the largest reserves of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed various kinds of barriers and some of them have emerged as important human petroglyphs.
So far, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been known.
These are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Generally, HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause common cold and/or constipation-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, which can cause lower respiratory tract infection with increased likelihood of manifestation of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary explanations in more and more patients.
In the mid-1960s, the influence of HCoV-229E, B814 separated those with colds from those with rhinoplasty.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before SARS spread, the notion was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS was the most devastating event in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with 10 percent death rate.
Ten years later, as a result of the spread of the respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Middle East, the islands of Mumbai continuously spread to the Arabs which spread to the whole world.
2019 HCoV (2019-nCoV, later called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) released from 2019, which kills more than 3,120 lives by March 3, 2020 and affects more than 91,000 people.
The world is preparing for the global virus SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are derived from cattle, cattle or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence confirm that all HCoVs are derived from primary stem cells, where the viruses exhibit well-compatible and non-pituitary genes but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 virus has presented unprecedented medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
HCoVs Animal Origins Analysis provides a framework for understanding the natural history, spread power, and transfer restrictive factors in various species.
This may also help or guide the finding of hosts for SARA-CoV-2 reserves, medium and breeding animals with key contaminants in the prevention of recurrence in the future.
In this review, we will provide an overview of animal origin, mixed species transfer and HCoVs pathogenicities.
In particular, we adhere to this common idea and discuss that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally non-pituitary in their natural reserve host animals and become pita zinc after transition to their new host organisms.
We also review the upward trend of HCoVs, which often increases the transfer with a decrease in the drinking zinc.
The results of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak have also been discussed in this context.
CoVs have been known for animals since the late 1930s.
HCoV-229E was first separated from B814 before the substance out of the nose of patients with common colds, different animals affected by different CoVs including Turks, cattle, cows, frogs, butterflies and dogs were separated.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs were identified.
Taking into account the historical arrangement, a brief summary of the date of the HCoVs survey (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
In 1966, HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper vein infections, and later WI-38 was adopted to grow into the cell lines of the fungi.
In 10 to 20 percent of cases, patients affected by HCoV-229E experienced symptoms of common colds including headaches, cracks, restlessness and throat inflammation with vomiting and swelling.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was separated from the member culture and subsequently placed in the serial pathway of the small mouse brain.
The medical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection look similar to those with HCoV-229E, which are not symptomatically different from other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhino viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and they are spreading more in temperate climates during the winter.
Typically, the growth time of these two viruses is less than a week, after which the disease lasts for about 2 weeks.
According to volunteer studies in humans, the influence of HCoV-229E in healthy people produces common cold.
Only a few patients who understand strength support show severe infection of the lower portion of the respiratory tract.
SARS, also referred to as “a common sample”, was the first well-documented global virus due to HCoV in human history and is the SARS-CoV etiological agent, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS could be recorded in the Chinese province of Zhuangdong in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic, which spread to many countries and continents, resulted in 8,096 cases with 774 deaths.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and the 10th day of the disease, occurs at the limit of viral load and this can increase by about two secondary cases.
Patients affected by SARS-CoV initially experience symptoms of muscle pain, headache, vomiting, numbness and colds, followed by shortness of breath, eating, and breathing difficulties.
Lymphatic panic, SARS’s unusual laboratory tests involve random liver function and some high creatine quarries.
Patients with SARS also observe widespread damage to the ulcer, proliferation of epithelial cells and an increase in microfages.
After that, about 20 to 30 percent of patients need extreme surveillance and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, lower breathing can affect multiple organs, including the kidney, liver and throat, usually with cytokine streams, which can be common in patients with low strength support.
For the first time, the virus was separated from the biopsy of the open flare of the relative of the index patient, who had traveled to Hong Kong from Zhuangzhou.
Since then, strong efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
In late 2004, HCov-NL63 was separated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
Initially, it is found in young children, elderly and low-strength support patients with respiratory disease.
The disease caused by HCoV-BL63 is common in inflammation of the neck, swollen eyelids, veins and neural glands.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from the nose sample of an eight-month-old boy in the Netherlands.
Although its identification occurred in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is approximately 4.7% of common respiratory disease, and its symptoms intensify in early winter, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with rocket-laying food, also known as crap.
In the same year, Hong Kong mother separated HCoV-HKU1 from a 71-year-old man who had been admitted to the hospital due to sampling and nasal inflammation.
With inflammation in community-derived samples and nursery tubes, HCoV-HKU1 associated with severe hemorrhoidal disorder was.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which causes mild respiratory disease, were found around the world.
These HCoVs derived from the quadruple community are very well-compatible with humans and generally have very little chance of causing changes to produce extremely pathogenic disease, although incidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as the more severe subtype infection case of HCoV-NL63, which causes severe infection in the lower respiratory tract, recently in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit and sustain themselves continuously within humans, they become low-intensity harmful or drink ginkgoes.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the outbreaks of a 60-year-old Saudi patient who suffered from severe sampling and kidney damage.
Where most of the laboratory-certified cases are found in the Middle East, and sometimes in close contacts with secondary spread, import cases are found in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a secondary web spread with 186 confirmed cases in South Korea.
MERS's medical explanations differ from SARS, which has developed characteristics of severe sampling.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have severe kidney failure, which is very unique to MERS in HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have urinary symptoms such as constipation and tenderness.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 cases confirmed by the laboratory accounted for 34.4% of deaths, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
During the mid-to-end of December 2019, a large number of patients with a sample of SARS-CoV-2 infection from the province of Hubei, Wuhan, China were recently identified.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency, calling it COVID-19.
By March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, of which 3.4% of those treated have died.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the deaths in these cases are 4.2%, while outside it it is 1.2%
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as vomiting, swelling and dyspnea.
Some patients have also been diagnosed.
It is one of the most severe symptoms and can increase severe shortness of breath syndrome.
Although 82% of the high nucleotides meet SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to continuous similarities, this is a cluster of different branches of the pyogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has symptoms of affected non-symptomatic subjects that could contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
There are many interesting similarities and differences in comparison and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2.
First, HCoVs are very similar in terms of duration and duration of disease growth.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the other four obtained from the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, it has been commonly observed that during infection with HCoVs derived from the SARS-CoV-2 community, including with non-specific, mild or no symptoms, it shows the characteristics of its infection.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen as a SARS-CoV infection, although this ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 shows interesting features such as HCoVs and SARS-CoVs derived from the transfer community.
On the one hand, the lowest transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after entering humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can also be found in chemical samples.
Although at least in some cases, future studies remain to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a major role in oral coronary transmission, such as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 will also appear temporarily like HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, after entering humans, the properties of SARS-CoV-2 including transmission, phytogenesis and sustainable spread will affect the final outcome of the COVID-19 transmission.
Four HCoVs obtained from the community that are well-consensual in humans cause mild symptoms.
From another point of view, it may also be true that humans are well-compatible with these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types of old HCoVs can be avoided by the global web.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who suffer severe HCoV diseases have been eradicated.
In order to do so, hosts will have to transfer HCoVs to humans to a sufficient extent to compete with the animal ban and collect the custom-made change.
In this regard, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts and the more people it affects, the more likely it is that humans will take it completely.
If it is taken properly, then it will be difficult to stop its transmission in humans through other measures that overcome coronavirus or infection.
For several years, four CoVs derived from the community have been circulating in the population, causing common coldness among defendants.
These viruses do not need animal storage.
Conversely, humans from the extreme ginkgo ginkgo SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not tolerate well and their transmission in humans could not be sustained.
They need to grow and grow in their animal stockpile, and possibly find opportunities to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more medium and extensive host animals.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs derived from the community.
At least at this time, it has more capacity to move like HCoVs obtained from the community.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs derived from the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether man will take it entirely and it will travel among humans without any stock or intermediate host animal.
Before talking about the animal origin of HCoVs, the host of HCoVs would be better to talk about animal promotion, nature, stockpiles, medium and extensive determination and their characteristics.
An animal, if it has a closely related racial involvement, acts as a host host of HCoVs by sharing a higher-type similarity at the level of the sequence of the nucleotide.
The genetic virus generally is well-compatible with this host animal and is non-pituitary.
Similarly, the host shelters live HCoVs continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the host is naturally affected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parent virus.
On the contrary, if HCoV becomes known to humans at the time of introduction or before the intermediate host organism, it is not better accepted by the new host and often becomes a pitch jink.
This intermediate host can act as an animal source of living human infection and then play the role of a host that massively accelerates human infection in humans.
If HCoVs do not maintain the transmission within the medium host, it will go on the path of infection.
Conversely, HCoVs can also consistent in medium host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In this case, the middle host becomes the natural reserve host.
Web disease figures have revealed with disappointment that the SARS index cases have a history of contact with sports animals.
The subsequent non-proliferation survey revealed that animal traffickers were more prone to anti-SARS-CoV lgG than the general population.
In the market for live animals, the first masks identified SARS-CoV, similar to SARS-CoV, were the Pygoma Larocha and a ricoon dog.
This promptly confirms that no SARS has been after all the markets have been killed.
However, it has been that masks from forests or coves were largely negative for SARS-CoV without appearance in the live animal market, suggesting that masks from forests or coves are only acting as widespread intermediate host animals but are not the natural storehouse of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80 percent of different animals in Zhongzhou’s fields have antibodies of SARS-CoV, it cannot be ruled out the possibility that many small dairy breeding animals act as widespread intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
They all show the closed path of SARS as host animals.
The natural host of SARS-CoV has resulted in the disintegration of the near-related skull CoV, called the SARS-related rheumatoid skull CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), which is present in the Chinese horse flare skull.
These specimens are positive for anti-SARS-CoV and the genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bits of CoV share a 92-88% nucleotid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have founded the new notion that skulls are the hosts of human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from specimens, but none other than a designated WIV1 can be distinguished as a live virus.
The human enzyme ACE2 is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from stem cell samples has been demonstrated to be used as a receptor for skin, cellular and human ACE2 intake cells.
Interestingly, Sira’s health was related to disabling SARS patient WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest SARS-CoV associated with the generation of shellfish, which shares 95 percent of the neocleotide sequence similarity.
Nevertheless, despite the extreme similarities between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the parent virus of the direct SARS-CoV and that the host of the immediate storage of SARS-CoV is not a survivor.
The same group’s MERS-CoV hemorrhoids as the CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 hemorrhoids were philo-genetically analyzed.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same representative receptor, Diphthyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) for virus entry.
MERS's RNA-dependent RNA polymers, identified from Europe and Africa, are closer to our positions in beta-to-CoV.
Until now, no live MERS-CoV can be found in forest shells.
MERS-CoV and its near-related bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, the host of the immediate storage of MERS-CoV may not survive.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East revealed that in many African countries, such as the eastern Middle East, there is a coupon of onto-siro positions for MERS-CoV-specific ineffective antibodies.
MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, has been separated from the nose of a coveted eagle by the finger, and this further indicates that the actual hosts of MERS-CoV act as reservoirs of life.
It is worth noting that, experimentally, mild symptoms were generally observed in MERS-CoV-affected ulcers but large-scale viral outbreaks were observed.
In particular, the virus spread from the affected ovaries not only through the respiratory tract but also through the artificial oral pathway, which is also the primary pathway of viral flow from the skin to the skin.
However, questions remain because there is no date of association with the outbreak of multiple confirmed cases of MERS before the onset of the symptoms, including the species of human-to-human transmitted or unknown animals that hide MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the isolated CoV RaT13 bat.
Like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are great for preferential parent relationships.
I mean, the host of the direct deposit of the SARS-CoV-2 batch may not survive until almost similar batch CoVs are found in the future.
Often, the bulk of Hunan seafood, which is associated with many early cases of COVID-19 and which potentially indicate a transition from animal to human, will be the intermediate host animals of the SARS-CoV-2 species of wildlife sold and killed.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have suggested that a group of dangerous dairy breeding small animals that go by the name Penguins (Manus Giovannica) may also be a haven for SARS-CoV-2-related paternal beta-CoVs.
They share a 85-92% similarity of the nucleotid sequence with the SARS-CoV-2 CoV gene.
However, these are as close associates to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
These file genetic trees are subgenetic herbs of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, one of which shares 97.4% of the amino acids with continuous identification, similarly with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD).
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite the continuously higher degree of similar genetic range, are more diverse.
Previous studies of patients with pegolens correlation of viral transmission from hepatitis samples, which are similar to related SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted a partial genetic sequence, which is approximately 86.3% of the full-length viral genes, adopting different assembly methods and manual protection.
We cannot rule out the possibility that Penguin is one of the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2
However, currently there is no evidence of direct support for SARS-CoV-2 from the source of Penguin due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and Penguin SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the existing distance between SARS-CoV-2 and Penguin SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
The advanced pathway for SARS-CoV-2 in shrimp, penguins and other dairy breeding animals remains to be established.
While, the best sequential similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Penguin, SARA-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs have been found in the receptor binding domain, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best wider genetic sequential similarities.
It is extremely disappointing that SARS-CoV-2 and Pegulin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-coVs are carried out through selected third-party cautious promotion of advanced similarities in the receptor-binding domain.
In the third species of wildlife, a response was proposed in favour of a combination between BTA CoVs related to Penguin SARA-CoV-2 and RaTG13.
The widespread spread of re-combination between BTA CoVs exists as a driving force in promotion.
The direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
File genetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can be the original source of bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
It has been that a bite of CoV in North America’s turmeric bite, literally ARCoV.2 (Applied Reggae Cove) showed a close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically linked to another bat CoV, literally HEPOSIDRUS/GHANANAPHEROMY/19/2008, which is suspected to survive on onions.
For explanation, the current knowledge about the animal origin of identified HCoVs is abbreviated in Figure 1 and Table 2.
File genetic analysis has provided evidence of events of mixed species transmission of HCoVs in history.
When domestic live stock HCoV-OC43 surpassed species to affect humans around 1890, the world recorded respiratory infection.
HCoV-229E's mixed species transfer date is less clear
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an Alfa Alfa CoV.
Many evidence supports the transmission of viruses directly from skeletons to humans.
The first, common environmental disasters can be contacted by skeletons from humans but not by alps.
It is closer to human beings.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related beta-alpha coVs are varied and non-pituitary in beta-alpha coVs, while alpha-alpha coV causes the spread of respiratory disease in affected animals.
Finally, Alpha Alpha CoV was not found in pets.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that alpacae obtain the HCoV-229E-related Alfa CoV from humans.
In fact, human pathogenetic viruses, including the Rabies Virus, Ebola Virus, Nephvirus and Hendra Virus are the direct sources.
So it’s no more surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans.
As an alternative, where beta-alfa CoVs act as a genetic transponder of a HCoV-229E, there may be alpha and onions that act as intermediate representatives, just like MERS-CoV cases, which transmit viruses to humans.
MERS-CoV acts as the best example of the transition of mixed species from skeletons to humans.
The primary source of MERS-CoV in the sperm is known as its initial identification and is also reinforced by subsequent results.
Obviously, genetic fragments and intermediate fragments provide a wide range of skin viruses for the transfer and exchange of intermediate fragments.
Longevity, treasured colonies, close social interaction and strong capacity for flooding, are suitable conditions for becoming an ideal 'virus spreader' for herbs.
On the other hand, for several decades, MERS-CoV has been introduced in a hilly wave.
It is well-compassed in those ounces that have changed directly from host living organisms to stable and host living organisms of natural reserves.
MERS-CoVins very mild disease and relatively low rate of change in these animals.
Its occasional transition in humans is an accident and humans are closed-path hosts of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transition.
Unlike the role of ovaries in the transfer of MERS-CoV, in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2, the role of Penguin, if any, is different.
In particular, Penguin BTA-CoVs are extremely pyogenic in Penguin.
Per they are the closed-path hosts for SARS-CoV-2B-CoV that meet the seizures in the SARS-CoV case.
Future studies may include or reject multiple possibilities of mixed species transfer of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, SARS-CoV-2 may be a host source of life, similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans share the environmental fat with skulls by playing crabs or coal mining.
Second, Penguin may be one of the fastest intermediate hosts, with the SARS-CoV-2-related virus newly introduced.
Human beings are caught with food, and they are caught with food.
It is possible that multiple dairy-breeding animals, including domestic animals, are affected by SARS-CoV-2.
Antibody is guaranteed in domestic and forest animal surveys.
Third, as outlined above, SARS-CoV-2 re-combination and consensus can occur in the third species that contacts both dermatitis and penguin.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
In addition to the different types of host animals, CoVs are important in facilitating three major factors by wireless in crossing many types of barriers.
The first is the transition of RNA.
Compared to the second single-trapped RNA viruses, the estimated rate of change of the CoVs can be considered to be "high" from "moderate" while the average rate of alternation per year on each site 2 depends on the stage of acceptance of the CoV of the zero-hosted organisms, as a 10-4 alternative.
CoVs contain pro-reading external banners, resulting in removal of which is better modified, requiring attention even becoming inexhaustible.
Interestingly, New Cleo Tide Analog Remedium is known for suppressing the transfer of CoVs by inhibiting its external BONCLES and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remedium is an extremely intelligent agent tested as an antibody SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
Nevertheless, the rate of change of CoVs is one million times higher than its host species.
Additionally, often times when CoVs can’t fit well in the host, the rate of change is higher.
Compare the highest rate of change of SARS-CoV, so apparently the rate of change in well-compatible SARA-CoV-2 in humans is lower.
Most of the time, it has already been agreed upon by another host in the nearest human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV is applied to those who are well-compatible in a couponed oval.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that the aged genes will quickly disrupt vaccine and antiviruses against SARS-CoV-2.
Secondly, the genes present in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional resilience in genetic modification for conversion and re-combination into large RNAs, thereby increasing the likelihood of mutual promotion of the mixed species, which is beneficial for the appearance of nucleic CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
It is supported by numerous unique reading frames to the end of the 3' of the genes and by helping them to code the healing function.
Third, through the unique mechanism of "copy selection", often CoVs randomly switch to RNA templates.
During the transfer of CoV RNA, in host organisms acting as a mixture, the doors change frequently.
To produce new CoVs, full length and subgenetic RNAs of extreme homology can be re-combined.
Evidence of the natural synergy of phylogenes has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as Bets SL-CoV and Bets CoV-HKU9.
Communications of the host of the virus in connection with the transfer
In addition to the three factors of the above-mentioned wireless, the host is an important factor in the active wireless interaction with the live receiver and the mixed species transfer.
With this, the reverse combination of SARS-CoV is taken as a common example, which prompted positive selection during mixed species transition.
In addition to the interactive analysis of the separation of SARS-CoVs in humans and cells, it is conceived that SARS-CoV will rapidly disintegrate in various host organisms, especially with changes in the receptor binding domain of S-cells.
Typically, the receptor binding domain in the CoV's S cell interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host animal's antibody reaction.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor binding domain on S1 pieces is 318th to 510th amino acids, which human ACE2 also binds its cursors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptors are able to identify ACE2 receptors for binding domains that allow the transfer of mixed species of the virus from various animals, including shellfish, caterpillar, caterpillar and ricoon dogs.
In fact, only the remains of 6 amino acids in the receptor binding domain were found differently in human and cellular cells, of which 4 are found in the form of receptor binding to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV has variations of K479N and S487T, which can enhance the interaction of spondylitis with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can prove to be important subalternatives to viral consensus in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit indicates that the essential dependence of human ACE2 on the S unit may change.
Certainly, a subsequent study of electromagnetic fractures indicates that this dependence is -10 to -20 times higher than the dependence between human ACE 2 and SARS-CoV S fractures.
It will also be interesting to determine whether or not another sub-receptor will be needed to transfer SARS-CoV-2
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also associated with ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors here, such as amino peptides N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can calculate the successful acceptance of these CoVs after the transfer of mixed species from their host animals to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of HCoV mixed species transfer is monitored, depending on another host organism and through binding factors.
The spread of these host species between humans and HCoVs natural reservoirs of host species, such as skulls, a mountainous owl and rats, can hinder the transfer of mixed species.
HCoVs include angry host animal dependence factors for a successful mixed species transfer and disruptive host animal binding factors.
In this regard, the identification and psychological determination of the characteristics of this important part of the virus’s host interaction with the living remains.
Extensive genetic testing of host dependence and SARS-CoV-2-binding factors may prove beneficial with the use of CRISPR’s latest technology.
Zero HCoVs Discharge: Go Back to Zero Ground
The variety of bat CoV provides sufficient opportunities for the emission of neutron HCoVs.
In this regard, bat CoVs acts as a counterpart of the genes of a HCoVs.
In addition, rapid change and genetic synthesis also boosts the promotion of HCoVs and acts as two key steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of the nucleic coding gene leaves the ability to rapidly change the phenotype of the wirel.
In SARS-CoV-supporting viruses, ORF8 is considered important in human consensus, as SARS-CoV-related beta viruses were being separated but the ORF8 viruses encoded differently.
In the early stages of human tissue, the separated esters discovered the properties of SARS-CoV’s 29 nucleotide termination.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and it is a consistent modification that promotes transition in host animals.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible re-combination with the alpha- and gamma-CoVs association, where small areas of re-combination in large numbers of RNA-dependent RNA polymers have been identified.
Recurrence locations were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV wave, which occurred in a hilly wave in Saudi Arabia, had to experience re-combination events between different chains.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re-combining events have also come to be seen in other CoVs, where HCoVs re-combine with other animal CoVs with their unstructured genes.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unidentified changes in viral genes, potentially avoiding selective pressures, such as the host animal power support system, resulting in getting rid of the virus.
An example of its effects is the loss of the full length of ORF4 in the prototype ester of HCoV-229 E, causing the removal of two nucleotide.
Although the persistence of ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-related herniated and ovarian viruses, Alpha-Alpha-CoV shows a single new chelotid entry, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the promotion of Nol HCoVs is also carried out through selected deployments in their reserve host animals.
When cysts are affected by CoVs, one goes without symptoms or mild symptoms, indicating mutual consensus between CoVs and cysts.
It turns out that the skin is anatomically and physically well-compatible with the CoVs.
For example, deficiencies in activating the inflammation-supporting reaction in the shells effectively reduce dynamic pythology through CoVs.
In addition, the skin is under pressure due to the low levels of expression of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the large host compatibility complex class I.
Furthermore, reactivating the higher levels of the oxygen type (ROS) generated by the high metabole activity of the shells, both by pressing the transfer of CoVs, and by influencing pro-reading through exorbitant bulbs, to create extreme petech zinc virus esters, when a new host animal is introduced, provides the selected depression.
Further pyogenic CoV esters can be produced by re-combination, which can increase the host for the acquisition of nucleic or nucleic properties for the consent of the animal.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-drinking ginkgo or mild symptoms in their reserve host animals such as skulls and eggs.
They are preparing to move strongly without the defensive reaction of the host.
In it, the secrets are hidden of why symptoms are shown and what causes severe cases in human infections are hidden.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by the hyperactivity of the defensive reaction and the site-caine stream, in which the stronger defensive reaction, more intense damage to the fungi.
In contrast, in a non-symptomatic disease surge, the defensive reaction has become de-cold from the transmission of CoV.
The same strategy of disassociating defensive reactions in the treatment of the antibody SARA-CoV-2 has a beneficial effect.
Especially in the skin, the reaction of interferon is powerful.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferon should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, the inflammatory activity of NLRP3 in the skin is poor.
Therefore, NLRP3 inhibition of inflammation in the treatment of COVID-19 with MCC950 may be beneficial.
The excretion of SARS-CoV-2 follows the public opinion derived by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a slice of beta-CoV has been found to share a %95 neo-cheloid similarity with SARS-CoV, there is a bat-CoV that shares a %96 neo-cheloid similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While cows and other animals in the pond have been found to shelter viruses like SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to be identified.
Penguin B-CoVs have surprisingly been discovered to be the homologists of SARS-CoV-2, meaning that Penguin is either acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or that Penguin B-CoVs may participate in the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
Though questions still remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was consciously or accidentally created by humans.
The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has caused CoVs to return to light.
The study of CoVs in herbs and other animals has unified our ideas about animal sources and animal stocks of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the skin and have been transmitted to humans through an intermediate host.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and the cell in the body, the SARS tissue can be effectively eradicated by closing the meat cell and killing the cell.
For the same reason, in anticipation of the discovery of multiple chains of Penguin BTA-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, Penguin should be removed from the meat bodies to prevent transmission from animals.
However, it remains to be clarified in future investigations when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through penguins and other dairy breeding animals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present for a long time in a hilled hive.
For locals, they also serve as the main means of meat, milk, leather and wool as well as a major source of transportation.
They are widely found in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, just like what has been done in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, it is impossible to sacrifice all of the waves to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, together with other measures to overcome the infection, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS for ounces.
Because we are not able to eliminate these viruses, they can cause the emergence of a new genetic type.
CoVs of species and species of animals are circulating in the forest.
Particularly, coVs with talent in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the discharge of new CoVs that are more transferable and/or vulnerable to humans in the future, there are many opportunities for the development and recovery of new CoVs.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
With the tests of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until they have a time to grow up.
Although shellfish have many features that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, chances of contact with human shellfish and other wildlife species can be reduced.
Continuous monitoring of dairy breeding animals is essential for a better understanding of CoV and its natural host, which is proven to be effective in preventing the transmission of the virus from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by staying away from the environmental breach of the natural reserve of human-to-human-transmitted disease viruses, the virus of disease transmitted from animals to humans can be prevented more effectively.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is still missing.
First, if the skin transmits a native virus of SARS-CoV-2 to Penguin, it would be interesting to see that the skin and Penguin can share the same environmental power in the circumstances.
Second, if the skin plays a more direct role in the transfer in humans, then it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with the skin.
Third, if the third dairy breeding animal acts as a real intermediate representative, it will have to explain how it interacts with other species including humans, skulls and penguins.
Finally, because many other dairy breeding animals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and testing should be conducted for infection.
If the chickpeas, penguins, or any chickpeas are dairy breeding animals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its parent virus, which are roughly the same, will be identified in its natural representatives.
Continuing research in this field will explain the development of SARS-Cov-2 in animals, as well as the significant impact on the inhibition and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to renew the diagnostic quality of COVID-19's "suspicious case" and "confirmed case"
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Fast Advisory Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Neural Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting widespread global coronavirus around the world.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, it is increasing gradually based on our awareness and scientific results of ongoing research and medical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, in response to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of China, we say that COVID-19 (Seventh Version) provides the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the final guidelines for assessment and treatment.
In December 2019, the 2019 neural coronavirus (2019-nCoV) spread, which is now officially listed as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been named severe respiratory impaired coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global virus.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed an accelerated advisory guide and it was published online in Multimedical Research on 06 February 2020.
He received a lot of attention after the publication.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, it is increasing gradually based on our awareness and scientific research results and medical practice experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the Republic of China has issued the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with a total of seven figures released from January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020, which is undergoing some fundamental changes in its design.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao Etal, who has proposed easy scores based on his medical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance book and this is a valuable reference to this worldwide web.
We will be grateful to them and will be grateful to them.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with COVID-19 (the same trial version) and the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of recent studies.
According to the seventh figure (3 March 2020), confirming the suspected case requires a comprehensive analysis by combining one feature of the history of the disease with two objects of medical explanation, or combining three objects of medical explanation without a clear date of the disease:
Web disease history: (1) travel or residence date to the city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) date of contact with several cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nicotine test); (3) city and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) date of contact with patients with fever or breathing symptoms; (4) confirmed cases of contact with anemia (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or breathing symptoms within 2 weeks in a small area such as home, school class, etc.)
Medical descriptions: (1) vomiting and/or breathing symptoms; (2) with the imagined characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) white blood cell count at the initial stage shows the number of normal, vomiting, or reduced lymphatic sites.
A confirmed case with any of the following elements should be assessed in python ginkgo or surgeological evidence: (1) be positive for real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) be positive for a sequence of entire viral genes showing high accuracy of identified coronaviruses; (3) be positive for lgM antibodies and lgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or be negative for lgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 or be ≥4 times higher than the recovery phase in the severe stage of the tire.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was included in the other (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) figures.
Pathogens in blood samples were included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) numbers; and neurological evidence was included in the seventh.
The investigator-based revision is continuing to find the most molecular acid-detecting kit to quickly diagnose at certified quality, as well as taking blood samples including the respiratory tract that enhance the availability of various samples, and assist in bringing positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there are many other evidence that reminds us to be careful with patients with traditional symptoms and without symptoms.
Therefore, Joetall’s flow chart should be updated, because he has classified the individual in “low risk” without medical symptoms.
The scoring system also needs to be confirmed in further medical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope for more direct evidence and urge readers to present their impressions.
For the assessment of “suspicious case” and “confirmed case”, we advise them to review and comply with the most up-to-date guidelines in their country of origin.
In order to provide assistance, our team is updating our guidebook on a timely basis.
Bangladesh has five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest ever.
Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the largest number of deaths in a single day.
Until last year, Bangladesh’s Institute for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) that the number of recorded affected cases included 114 active cases and 33 health-related cases at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
Speaking in detail in an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meredith Sabrina Flora said four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mary Jedi, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He said that two of them were killed.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global virus.
A family member of the hospital told the Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Shiloh Seif Rahman, who was the director of Bengali’s insurgent, who was monitored at Kuwait’s Metropolitan Hospital.
On Sunday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh Road Transport and Tower Minister Abdul Khadir said public transport will be shut down for a long time from this coming week under initial planning.
Initially, the shutdown of public transport started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on April 4.
Transportation of essential items – medical supplies, fuel and food – was still permitted.
On March 8, the first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in the wife of two people who had returned from Italy and one of them.
Until March 19, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has more than 10 million infections worldwide.
On Thursday, data from John Hopkins University indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded ten million.
Approximately 52,000 deaths are associated with COVID-19, the disease that coronavirus causes.
The message came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and the first coronavirus-related death in Zimbabwe.
On Friday, North Korea claimed it was one of the few countries that has been free from the coronavirus.
As of April 4, the World Health Organization 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases after 10 a.m. on mid-European time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, more than 5,900 cases of coronavirus were recorded.
CBS News on data from John Hopkins University that the coronavirus infection has resulted in more than 1,000 U.S. deaths.
Worldwide, countries have announced harsh measures to stop the spread of the disease.
On Friday, the mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, extended the town’s lockout to 1 May.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin has announced that payments will continue until April 30 without working to the Russians.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency to 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 backed, and one against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the Karefu for a full day in the holy cities of Mekkah and Medina: before that, the Karefu day was effective from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand will apply the crucifix from 10 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Dewey has announced that the state has extended the residence order to May 1.
In the shops of Australia, the limit of the tissue paper of the house cell was reduced in every transaction.
During the spring and weekends, Australian store chains Wall Street and Queensland reduced restrictions on the purchase of white paper tissue in all stores at the national level to two and one packs per transaction.
Aldi also presented a package limit on Friday.
These boundaries were checked out and posted as messages on the chain’s Facebook pages.
COVID-19 was to have been stored by buyers in case people needed self-construction isolation due to fear.
At the same time, Wall Street also limited the purchase of housework paper to one pack on each order for home delivery.
These changes are followed by four pack restrictions on each transaction announced by Wall Street and Quicks on March 4 and 5.
Quales, in a media release on March 8, said that with a four-pack ban on the same site, “many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery,” and that the request was considered “example,” while ALDI called it “unanticipated” on a Facebook post on Monday.
According to a spokesman for Wall Street, last week’s sales had a “great increase”.
Costa Rica’s store in Canberra also limited last week’s allowed number to two packs.
In order to reduce the quotation, Quales ordered large packs from suppliers and increased the sequence of deliveries, Wall Street ordered additional storage, while ADLI stored the plan for special initial availability on the day of closure.
The executive director of the Australian Retailers’ Association, Messel Zimmerman, said retailers are trying to increase stockpiles, but a ban on delivery trucks by the local council has made it difficult.
In addition to increasing production costs, because suppliers try to fulfill the request and do something special.
On Monday, ALDI announced that after the storage was closed, some stores could not go to a specific location.
Dr. Warren Martimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said in a News.com.au report that the store fills up storage every day at night.
He said that house cleaning tissue paper is a big thing, which leads to a small amount of storage in its number, and, when sold, leaves the vast space of the shelf empty, which makes it feel like a tough word.
The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in ABC News, “The Quotes and Reviews of Wall Street are [that] if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products such as Bethlehem and Synthesizer can be purchased and if they are in quantity, you can reduce the fear.
A creep-giving re-cycled home-shaped tissue paper maker said to the previous day that they will be without storage.
According to News.com.au’s report, Cambridge Clark, which makes the cleansing beetle tissue, and the Solaris that makes the sorbit, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A property purchase and sale site Domain.com that some property sellers in Melbourne offer free white paper to the first callers in New Zealand, when shoppers had time on the occasion of the World Workers’ Day due to the long weekend.
Hidden in the diary Darun, NT News’ Thursday numbers included eight pages of insecticides, which meant they were cut and used as a tissue paper.
According to a report from ABC Australia on March 3, the store was actually reluctant to impose these sanctions, about which he said there was no plan to introduce a ban on their purchases.
The messenger also said that the demand for other products, including masks, sanitaries, dry items, hand washers and other products, is also higher.
Similarly, on Tuesday evening, outside of Australia, British supermarket purchases were observed to be limited to two to 12 roll packs.
The World Health Organization has announced the recognition of COVID-19 as a global virus.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the continued spread of COVID-19 — the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — as a global disease.
Although the elevator “biological disease” refers to a rapidly spreading disease, not to the extent– how dangerous specific cases are, the World Health Organization has stressed the need for action by governments.”
All countries can change the world.
If countries react to identify their people, test them, treat them, separate them, focus on them, and move them.
We are deeply troubled by the construction of these two types of disease due to the speed and severity of its flow and the disturbing limit of its activity against it.
Former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Tom Friedman, said the global web is “unusual.”
In his remarks published in CNN in February, he said: "In addition to the flu, no such sequence has been found from the beginning of any other respiratory virus until the global outbreak."
He said, “We have not seen a worldwide web site that has coronavirus.”
He continued, “And we have not seen a world wide web that could be controlled at the same time.”
The new status of WHO came in January after the World Health Organization declared WHO an international health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Psychiatric and Multidisciplinary Institute, Dr. Thessonny Fossi, said about the disaster, “It’s true, it’s heading toward further destruction.”
The Associated Press that the number of patients with COVID-19 abroad worldwide was 126,000 by Thursday, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
Coronavirus 2019-20 is a type of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that causes severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak occurred in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and was declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a global outbreak on March 11, 2020.
By April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million patients with COVID-19 were in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364,000 people were displaced.
The death rate in China has risen by 4 percent, while globally it rises from 13.04 percent in Algeria to 08 percent in New Zealand.
Its common symptoms include vomiting, gout and difficulty breathing.
Complications may include symptoms of severe difficulty in sampling and breathing.
The period from the onset of the disease to the onset of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can range from two to four days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Initial treatment is symptomatic and auxiliary treatment – the recommended precautionary measures include tearing the legs, temporarily clinging to the mouth, keeping a distance from others, and monitoring and happy separation for those who suspect they are affected.
Authorities around the world have been advocating travel bans, carnage, the enforcement of karfioka, the control of risks in the workplace and the closure of facilities.
The World Wide Web has referred to various social, religious, political, and religious events in the global economy and has discussed the widespread scope of goods purchased in disadvantage.
Schools and universities in 193 countries either shut down nationally or locally, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world’s population.
Misconceptions about the virus were spread online and incidents of insult and discriminatory behavior against Chinese people, other people of color in East and Southeast Asia and those where the events of the virus were overrepresented.
The low-income went and the closure of large industries caused the density in the air and the emissions of carbon decreased.
Health officials in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubai Province) a collection of unknown-cause sampling cases on December 31, 2019 and began an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of these events belong to the Hunan seafood hole cell market and therefore it is believed that this virus is from the generation of animal diseases.
The virus, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that has no close connection to coronaviruses, pinguin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first person to be exposed to the symptoms of the disease was a person who became ill on December 1, 2019, and the person was not apparently associated with the market giant.
Two-thirds of the initial events in December 2019 were related to markets.
On March 13, 2020, South China’s Morning Post recommended in an unbelievable report that the event of a 55-year-old person in the Hubei Province on November 17, 2019 could be the first – on February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization that although events are declining in China but because of the sudden increase in events in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new events from China has surpassed the number of new events in China for the first time.
It may be unlikely that the number of events will be reduced, especially in people with common symptoms of the disease.
On February 26, comparatively fewer incidents were among young people aged 19 and under, which accounted for 2.4% of global incidents.The UK’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wales, estimated that 60% of the UK’s population would be affected before becoming an effective assault.
According to the official protocol, the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 has been confirmed to be positive.
Until March 23, no single country tested 3% of its population, and the official policy of several countries was that only those with normal symptoms would not be tested, as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, 86% of COVID-19 patients could not be detected and that unregistered patients were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections affected in Italy was considerably higher than the cases.
The initial estimate of primary reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Agency concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not give up, the period from the onset of symptoms of the disease to death is 6 to 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
By April 10, 2020, 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80 percent of deaths in China were in people over 60 years of age and 75 percent in people with pre-existing diseases including cardiovascular disease and shock—the official number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide was generally comprised of those who received their COVID test positive according to the official protocol.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 can be many more than that, because those deaths do not include those who die without testing - for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Part data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths from COVID during this global cycle exceeded the official number of people who died from COVID by x4–5.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that “we know that [declared deaths] have been low,” this statement confirms reports that decline the number of deaths in the U.S. This type of discounting reports are often found during the global Ebola as the first event of a certified outbreak in Wuhan during the 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu Ebola occurred on 9 January 2020.
The first deaths outside China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first deaths outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By 28 February, more than a dozen deaths had occurred outside central China, in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and regions have deaths from every majority except for Southern Armenia.Many common measures are being used to determine deaths.
With the region and time passing, this number varies, and affects testing, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, time after the initial breakdown of the disease, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
Based on June Hopkins University data, the global deaths and events rate by April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The ratio of events and deaths in China (from 1 to 10 January 2020 for those with symptoms from the onset of the disease) has fallen by 17.3% (from 1 to 2 February 2020 for those with symptoms from the onset of the disease) to 0.7% – other measures include the death rate (CFR), which shows the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which shows the percentage of affected people who die from a disease (reported and undiagnosed).
These numbers are not for a particular time and are for a particular population from the infection to the final solution of the case.
Many experts have tried to count this number for a specific population.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford has estimated that infection-related death rates in the global web range between 0.1% and 0.39% combined.
The high limits of this estimate remain consistent with the results of the first differentiated tests of COVID-19 conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the effects of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that this worldwide web can be controlled.
The outcome and end of this disease are different and unusual depending on the location of occurrence.
Mackey Boni, of Penn State University, said, “If not, multiple spread generally increases as the level rises and finally begins to go down when the disease no longer meets hosts.
It is not possible, however, that this will be done at any time, and this will be done at any time.”
Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanchan stressed that "this could end by June" if all countries are encouraged to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to prevent the infection.
On March 17, Charles said to Edm of the London School of Hygiene and Traffic Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 “probably will be circulating for one or two years.”
According to a study by the Imperial College at the time of Neil Ferguson, distancing and other measures will be necessary until "until no vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more").
William Schiffner of the University of Wanderbilt said, “I don’t think it’s likely that this coronavirus — will be completely eradicated — because it’s easily transmissible” and it “will turn into a weather disease, and will come back every year.”
The death will be reduced and the death will be reduced, and the death will be reduced.
COVID-19 disease symptoms can be relatively unspecified and conventional people can be without symptoms.
The two common symptoms are wet (88%) and dry skin (68%)
Fewer common symptoms include swelling, swelling in the throat, termination of sleeping capacity, stopping breathing, pain in the legs and joints, throat disorders, headaches, colds, caia, bleeding in the stomach, swelling or blue rash. The World Health Organization says that one in four people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) include in the list of emergency symptoms: difficulty breathing, frequent pain or pressure in the chest, sudden pain in the chest, difficulty swallowing and face or lips bleeding; if these symptoms are present, urgent medical attention is recommended – the disease can lead to more pronounced severe symptoms, severe respiratory disorders, body clotting, corruption of blood and death.
Some of these rare individuals may be without symptoms, they can be converted to confirmed patients without medical symptoms test results, so the researchers have recommended that people who are in contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to stay away from infection.
In China, the proportion of diseases without symptoms is estimated from a few to 44%.
Typically, the incubation period (the average time for the onset of infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; this usually lasts five days.For example, in a situation of uncertainty, the termination of the sensation of numbness in people affected by COVID-19+ originally occurred in 30% of people who subsequently decreased to 15% of people.
This illness is very common, and its extent is very clear.
It is believed that the disease is initially caused by close relationships and by the twin buds that occur when lying, chanting or speaking; where close contact is 1 or 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) away.
Studies have shown that it is possible to climb from 4.5 meters (15 ft) to 8.2 meters (27 ft) without a hinge.
Many people have advised that the virus can spread from the chubby buds that live in the air for an excessive amount of time that occurs during speech. breathing can cause breathing buds, including during conversation, although this virus does not usually occur in the air.
These buds can swallow inside the mouth or nose of people nearby, or possibly enter the hills when they breathe.
Medical operations such as injecting tubes and artificial mouth-to-mouth breathing (CPR) can take out the moisture of the breath and thus it can be absorbed in the air.
It can be swallowed when someone tastes the surface of the material and then tastes their cheeks, nose or mouth.
Though there are such fears that it can flatten the faces, but its danger is thought to be very little.
The Chinese government has rejected the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the substance that is removed from the body.The virus is very frequent up to three days before the onset of symptoms, although its infection is only possible before the symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people get a positive test three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that the transfer of the disease is effective before the onset of symptoms.
Only a few confirmed cases have been from the laboratory where no symptoms of the disease have been revealed before, but a number of countries have revealed symptoms transmitted without contact during investigations.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that although it’s not entirely clear how easily the disease can be transmitted, one person can generally affect two to three people—the virus can survive for days, ranging from levels to levels.
In particular, the virus was identifiable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, one day on the goat and four times on the straw.
However, this period varies in humidity and temperature, and the COVID-19 test has been positive in pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that this virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, but British authorities advise digestion after contact with animals, as they do when contacting other surfaces that people have experienced.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a non-resistant virus that was first separated from the three people in the sample who belong to the group of severe respiratory diseases in the city of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronavirus – outside the human body, the virus can be eradicated by saponin, which analyzes its protective shell.
It is believed that it is from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that coronavirus relatively belongs to the family of B. coronavirus (N. B.), which is derived from the two species of Chemagader in the subfamily.
At the total genome level, it remains almost 96% similar to the other coronavirus samples (BatCoV RaTG13)
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino axis is found in human and penguin viruses in several parts of the genome chain.
By comparing the full genome so far, it has emerged that 92% of the genetic material is shared in the Penguin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that the Penguin virus is an average host.
Temporary diagnosis of viral infection may be based on the symptoms of the disease, although confirmation from conventional cell tissue or ICT-TCP is done by the final reverse transcription polymers-chine reaction (rRT-PCR).
In a study comparing PCR to PCR in Wuhan, it was that PCR is less specific but significantly more sensitive than PCR, although its photography features contain the process of other samples and diseases.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology suggests that CT should not be used for screens or as a first mirror test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test at the same time uses reverse transcription polymers Chinese reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is done on a breath or blood sample.
The results are usually available from a few days to a few days.
Generally, this test is carried out through the creation of infertility, although it can be used in the throat - many laboratories and companies have been tested for antibodies.
Until April 6, 2020, none of these was sufficiently valid to be approved for widespread use.
In the U.S., a circuit test has been developed by CELEX, which was only approved for emergency use in documented laboratories.
The characteristics of the radiography and compound tomography (CT) in which the symptoms of the disease are found include asymmetric peripheral glass optics and non-present overflow.
The Italian Radiology Society is creating an international online database of imaging results of certified events.
Because of overlap from other infections such as adenovirus, COVID-19 imaging identification without PCR confirmation has limited characteristics.
A large study in China compared breast CT results to PCR which showed that although photography has a low characteristic for infection, but it is faster and more sensitive, it suggested that it be considered to be used as a screening device in web areas.
Artificial intelligence-based build-up neural networks were created so that both the virus’s reproductive properties, through radiography and CT, could be detected.
The strategies for preventing the transmission of this disease include collectivelyining personal health, cleansing the bones, cleansing the ankle, nose or mouth without cleansing the bones, and cleansing the tissue, cleansing and cleansing the tissue directly into the cleavage debris.
Those who have previously suffered from this infection are advised to wear circular masks in public places.
Distance-keeping measures are recommended to prevent the disease from spreading – several countries have restricted travel or banned unnecessary travel to other countries or to travel to areas affected by the disease.
However, the virus has reached the stage of spreading into the community in a large part of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community and how many people in the community do not know how and where it has been affected – people with health problems, who are at risk of being affected by the disease, are advised to adopt standard precautions regarding contact and protection of the infection – contacting health authorities is an important way to find the source of the infection and prevent its further transmission.
For this purpose, privacy concerns have been addressed by governments using location data via mobile phones, Amnesty International and 100 other organizations have issued a statement urging to limit this type of surveillance.
By April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented it or recommended it for voluntary use, a dozen or more groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to get the user’s chance to locate from another mobile.
The user then receives a message if he has stayed close to a person whose COVID-19 result has been positive. misconceptions are circulating in relation to the prevention of infection; for example, putting water in the nose and swallowing the mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, but many agencies are working on preparing one.
It is recommended to prevent the disease from spreading.
CDC often advises people to digest from soap for up to twenty seconds, especially after cleaning or when the bones are apparently dry; before cleaning; and when a nose is cleaned, dress, or chew.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by soap when its protective vessel breaks down.
The CDC also recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol in volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to avoid mouth, nose, or mouth with no tears.
The surfaces should be cleaned in a number of ways (stainless steel level should be held for a minute in front of a bacterial strain), which includes %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 isopropionol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide and 0.2 to 7.5 leaker %povidon-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzoconium chloride and chorohexidric gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC suggests that if a suspicious or certified COVID case appears in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas such as the office, the home, the shared compartment, the shared electrical equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by patients, should be cleaned from the virus.
Health organizations have recommended that people eat and chew their mouths, say their mouths or their tissues, and immediately destroy such tissues.
Wearing a circular mask is recommended for those who may be affected, because wearing a mask normally limits both the volume and distance of the bonds discharged by the person when he speaks, cheats, and cheats.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to the University of Leeds virus expert Stephen Graffin, “Wearing a mask can reduce the likelihood of people touching their faces, which is a major source of infection if the skin is properly preserved without health.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that healthy people wear masks only if their health is seriously endangered, as they are seeing a COVID-19 patient, although they admit that people wear masks to get rid of their faces.
Many countries have encouraged people to wear facial masks.
The U.S. recommends wearing untouchable facial masks made from CDC clothes – China has specifically suggested that healthy people in the public use deteriorating medical masks, especially when they are likely to walk close to others (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong suggests that public income sources use or wear circular masks standing in crowded areas.
Health officials in Haiti are encouraging people to make clothing masks and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have imposed a ban on people going to the public without wearing masks or with their nose and mouth covered.
On March 16, Vietnam has asked everyone to wear a face mask when they go to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has authorized everyone to wear a mask when entering the shops.
Israel has urged residents to wear facial masks when walking in the city.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks daily since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks in buses running between railway stations and cities from April 1.
In Panama, it has been decided to wear a face mask while going out of the house, while in the countryside it has been advised to prepare a mask for those who can’t afford to buy the mask.
Face masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (which is called physical distance keeping) involves actions of disease control aimed at limiting close contact between individuals by reducing the influx of infection.
These measures include the closure of carriages, travel restrictions, schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping centers.
People can apply social distance methods while living in the neighborhoods, escaping from going into attack, not getting blessings and physically staying away from each other.
Many governments are implementing social distances or advising in areas affected by cyber disease.
Recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations, the excess of the congregation was quickly reduced from 250 people (where there was no known occurrence of COVID-19 in the area) to 50 who were later reduced to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.Elderly adults and those who suffer from a condition such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and weak defence system may suffer from severe illnesses and complications, and they have been advised by the CDC to stay at home for more time due to the onset of tuberculosis in the community.At the end of March 2020, other health and health agencies began to change the term "disability distance" from "physical distance" to make it clear that its aim is to limit physical contact whileining social relationships, either practically or remotely.
By the term social distance, people began to assume that they should be completely separated from the world, instead of being encouraged to stay in touch with other people by alternative means.
These include recommendations that they only restrict sexual intercourse with their partner who has no symptoms of viruses or viruses.
Self-structured isolation on the home is recommended for those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected of being affected by it.
Health institutions have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-constructed isolation.Many governments have required or recommended that the entire population in a traditional area go to self-constructed isolation.
The strongest guidelines of the self-constructed Qur’an have been issued for those who are in the most severe danger group.
Those who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where the disease is widespread, have been advised to take a 14 day self-cancellation after the last possible exposure.
It is a matter of understanding, of understanding, of understanding, of understanding, of understanding.
The overcoming strategy is constructed in the early stages of the Ebola and the goal is to isolate people by finding them, introducing other measures of infection control to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the disease from spreading further, efforts enter the relief phase: measures are taken to reduce its spread and its effects on the health system and society are reduced.
Measures to prevent and mitigate effects, both should be taken together at the same time.
The global wave needs to take excessively harsh measures to suppress it so that the ratio of the primary wave inflow will be reduced from 1 to a minimum.A part of the multi-disease inflow regulation is to try to reduce the wave inflow, which is called to reduce the wave inflow.
This reduces the anxiety for health services, which are being defeated, and provides too much time for vaccination preparation and treatment.
External measures that can regulate the influx of the virus include precautions, such as cleansing the stomach, wearing facial masks, and self-assessment; social measures aimed at physically distancing, such as shutting down schools and dismantling social events; engaging the community to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; the same environmental measures such as cleansing-and-preventing the virus have been taken in China, once the Ebola’s intensity has emerged, such as imposing severe sanctions and travel restrictions on complete cities.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures aimed at limiting the influx of the virus.
South Korea has made large-scale screening and locally carnival and has warned about the movement of traditional people.
Singapore granted financial assistance to the traditional people who carnate themselves and those who did not do so reimbursed them with heavy fines.
In Taiwan, the production of facial masks and the authorized storage of medical equipment increased.The comparison between the United Kingdom and the United States shows that relief (i.e. a decrease in spread but not an end to it) and pressure (a rise in global web) are major challenges.
Excessive reduction policies reduce the increase in health demand by two-thirds and the death rate by half, but eventually the death and health system can be defeated by hundreds of thousands.
The pressure can be preferred as a transitional but it should continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or as long as a vaccine is available, if that is earlier) otherwise it quickly returns to health when measures are softened.
The World Wide Web causes long-term interference, social and economic expenses for pressure.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but preparation efforts are ongoing, including experiments on existing drugs.
Using cold medications, drinking excessive amounts of water and relaxing can help eliminate the symptoms of the disease.
Depending on the severity of the disease, you may need to help with oxygen storage, breathing and breathing.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Many of the compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that “traditional and non-traditional strokes” can bring relief in SARS-CoV-19 diseases.
Increasing the capacity and consensus of health care providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key measure to respond to HIV.
The ECDC and the World Health Organization Regional Office of the European Union have issued guidelines for resource change at various stages for hospitals and primary health centers, including focusing on laboratory services on the ability to test COVID-19, rejecting optional practices where possible, isolating and retaining COVID-19-positive patients, and increasing extreme surveillance capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available vaccines and locations.
There are many theories about where the first event (i.e. zyro disease) will begin.
The first case of the new coronavirus was filed in the city of Wuhan, Hubei, China, on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hobby gradually increased.
Most of these events have come from Hunan’s hole cell marine market, where live animals are sold, and there is a theory that the virus came from animals of this kind; in other words, it comes from the generation of animal mutants.Unknown cause sampling of sampling cases was announced on December 26 and treated in the Hubei Provincial Hospital by Dr. Zhang Jacyan, who informed Wuhan Zhejiang CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Central Wuhan Hospital questioned their citizens about “SARS-like coronavirus.”
Eight of them, doctors, including Lee Wanliang, were accused by the police of carrying out joint operations and another, Yi Feng, was accused of carrying out high-ranking operations by his senior officers.
Later on, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission released a public news on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
Until the beginning of January, Wuhan’s health authorities were informed of a number of unknown sampling incidents so that the investigation was ordered.In the early stages of Wuhan’s outbreak, the number of incidents almost doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces of China, which played a key role in China's New Year's arrival as Wuhan's transport sources and railway significant interchanges.
On January 20, China 140 new incidents in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data revealed that by 20 January 2020, 6,174 people had already had symptoms of the disease. by 26 March, the United States has hit China and Italy with the most recent confirmed cases worldwide. by 9 April 2020, there are reports of more than 1.61 million cases worldwide; over 97,000 people have died and over 364,000 have been diagnosed.

World Health and Disease - World Health and Disease Spread Review
A list of deaths and deaths due to various diseases.
Simulation of wildlife and diseases transmitted from animals to humans - health risks associated with long-distance wildlife trade
Laboratory tests for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses include methods that detect the presence and presence of viruses that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCR samples confirm the presence of the virus, which contains coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is only designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (siriology) can also be used for diagnosis and population monitoring.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those who had so few symptoms that they were too common to report or in whom no symptoms appeared.
Based on the results of these tests, the exact disease rate of death and the level of strength support present in a population can be determined.
Due to limited tests, such as the Ebola margin, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population by 2020.
Until March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is also a big difference in how much it will be tested between countries.
This change has led to significant differences in the death rate report, which is likely to be higher than estimated in some countries.
Tests on breath samples can be obtained in a variety of ways using real-time reverse transcript polymer chine reaction (rRT-PCR), including non-transferable barrel or wholesale samples.
Generally, results are available within a few hours of taking 2 days.
The PT-PCR test is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, when it begins to grow in the flowers, the virus disappears in the throat.
For affected subjects being tested for the second week, the sample content can be used as an alternative through the section catheter from the deep airway or the digestive up matrix (heavy).
The first PCR test will be developed in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcript polymeric Chinese reaction (rRT-PCR) based on the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On January 28, 2020, South Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (PowerCheck Coronavirus) test.
It searches for the "E" gene spread by the BTA coronavirus, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI group in China was among the first companies to be approved for the emergency use of the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 poison kit from China's National Medical Product Administration. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is dividing its 2019-null coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RTC-CPR diagnosis panel into public health labs through the International Regent Resources.
One in three tests in the old version of the test ketone failed to correct due to poor chemical interactions, and obstacles in CDC tests in Atlanta could result in fewer than 100 samples per day in February 2020.
Tests using two ingredients were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the option of emergency use and the U.S. Business Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the countrywide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19
Also, Quest Diagnostics has made available -19 COVID tests nationwide by March 9, 2020.
The quantity limits have not been announced; sampling and further processing should be accurately in line with the CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 Test State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR created and developed.
According to Mayo Clinic’s report on March 12, 2020, it developed a test for the outbreak of COVID-19 infection. on March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics obtained FDA approval for the test, which could be done in a large number of 3.5 hours, i.e. a machine could test approximately 4,128 in a 24-hour interval.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the Emergency Use Permit (EUA) for Abott’s m2000 system to the Abott Laboratory; the FDA had previously granted similar permits to Hologic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also obtained the EUA from the FDA for a test that lasts 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it does not require a series of alternate temperature checks, this procedure results in positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
At the moment there are 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to do 50,000 tests per day by increasing the number of machines made.A test that uses a monoclonal antibody that is specifically limited to the nucleocyped protein (N protein) of the coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid flu test.
The final words of the review of the written material in March 2020 are that "the radiographic assessment of the breast in the initial destination is not important, however, the presence of [CT computed tomography] before symptoms appear is possible."
The general characteristic of CT is a two-sided multi-labyrinth glass folded pen that includes an inappropriate and rear-partitioning envelope.
As the disease grows, it manifests complete control, crazy smoothness and stability.
In Wuhan, where this worldwide web was born most, a study suggested that comparing PCR and CT suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, many of its characteristics correspond to the sampling and stages of the disease.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that “CT should not be used as a first priority for the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The reaction of strength supports the infection, including the partial reaction of IgM and IgG antibodies.
They can be used for the outbreak of infection in people who have symptoms starting 7 days ago, for the determination of strength support, and for those who are under close supervision.
In many clinical laboratories, high-performance automated systems will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
A single blood sample is commonly used for CLT, although many samples can be used to capture strength support.
For PoCT, a blood sample is usually obtained by splashing on the skin.
Contrary to the PCR method, pre-release testing is not necessary on March 26, 2020, the FDA listed those 29 agencies that notify the agency and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it is faster than conventional PCR for RNA virus tissue.
Generally, antibodies appear to be detected 14 days after the infection began.In early April, the UK discovered that no one in the purchased test kits was suitable for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that suspicious patients can stand at home, "The emergency sector will give the patient a sample tube", he will squeeze it, send it back and get the result a little later.The UK NHS has announced that these suspicious cases are starting a scheme to test at home on an experimental basis, which eliminates the risk of the patient passing the infection to other people or if they come to the hospital the ambulance saves it from the jets of cleansing it from infection once used.
South Korea has tested faster and faster than any other country thanks to Drive Troocenters.The National Association of Health Insurance Studies in Germany said on March 2 that it has the capacity to perform 12,000 tests per day in general settings and will perform 10,700 tests last week.
When the physical testing is said, the expenses of health insurance are borne.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Until March 19th, drives of these tests were offered in several major cities.
Until March 26, 2020, the number of tests in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were.
According to the first laboratory survey, 483,295 samples tested by Clinder Week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (%6.9) were positive for 2-SARS-CoV. Technion and Rambam Hospitals in Israel developed and selected a method to test samples from 64 patients back in time, in which all samples are collected and further tested only when the samples are positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000-square-meter emergency laboratory called “Huo-Yan” (China: 火眼, or English: “Fire Eye”) was established, which was launched by BGI on February 5, 2020.
and N.
The Wuhan Lab method was immediately adopted by Ho Chi Minh Libraries located in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus in a total of 12 cities across China.
Capacity of 50,000 tests per day until March 4, 2020. Origami Assays has released an open source multi-element design that can test 1122 cases of COVID-19 in just 93 attempts.
By March, the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States had become a barrier to large-scale testing.
This has led some authors to shut down a protocol for sampling preparation that limits samples to 98C (208F) for 5 minutes so that RNA genome or chromosome can be extracted for further testing.The United Arab Emirates is now testing more of its population coronavirus than any other country, according to a March 31 announcement, and is underway on the project to reach its entire population.
It benefited from both the drive-toro capacity and the large population-built laboratory of Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their emergency-floating embryos "HUO-Yan" based in China).
Established in 14 days, the laboratory has performed thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory to work on such a large scale outside of China.
Different tracks of testing have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German compound for low-income countries, which do not have the resources to cut,
The German compound, released on 17 January 2020, was unavailable until 28 January for the U.S. Gee Protocol to overcome the disease, which made restrictions on the quality of test kits in China and the U.S. in the early days of delayed Ebola-related tests available in the U.S., and could not be cut despite recommendations and requests from countries and Australian health experts.
In contrast, experts say that the large supply of South Korean testing resulted in a decrease in the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean government has expanded its testing capabilities in private-sector laboratories in recent years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization (WHO) urged to strengthen testing programmes to reduce the global spread of COVID-19, which led to increased demand for testing and thousands of millions of tests in U.S. private laboratories, and pressure on the supply of soap and chemical interactions for wound cleaning.
In March 2020, China its test kit rating.
In the U.S., the CDC made cuts with “cuts”, the government then overturned office barriers that prevented private testing.Spain bought cuts from the Chinese Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were not correct.
The formulation explained that the wrong result is not to use the shell or cuts correctly in sampling the sample.
The Spanish Ministry said that false-resulted cats would be removed and replaced by a test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% purchased from China by the State of the Czech Republic gave false results.
Turkey’s health ministry said Turkey’s cats bought from China had “a high rate of mutilation” and they “were not put into use” and the UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
The test results showed positive results in attempts to identify people who were carcinated and those who were in contact with patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.
In Vo, Italy, where the first deaths of COVID-19 occurred, working researchers tested the entire population, consisting of approximately 3,400 people, twice over ten days.
Nearly half of those who were tested had no signs, and all the investigated cases were incinerated.
Restricting travel to a particular human group resulted in the new infection case being completely terminated.
The global coronavirus outbreak of 2020, full of contacts with affected individuals, travel restrictions, testing and carnival, has had far less impact on Singapore than developed countries in the world, where there were no strict restrictions such as shutting down the business of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore has started advising citizens to stay limited to their homes from March 28, but opened schools on March 23 after the holidays ended.
Many other countries have survived this global Ebola by strict measures such as identifying patients, travel restrictions, testing and carnival, but have not imposed a harsher lock-down, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical survey, those countries that have tested more, by calculating the rate of death, have a lower rate of death, because these countries are able to contain people with little or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that do not have national laboratories capable of testing COVID-19 should send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to WHO’s 16th National Laboratory for certification testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column "% of participation tests" refers to a country's testing policy.
The country that tests only those who enter the hospital, there will be a higher percentage of positive tests than the country that tests all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, they will all get the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing) is also known as hand health, the process is aimed at cleaning your hands from soil, garlic, pesticides or other unnecessary materials.
On some “necessary occasions” a day with soap and hand washing repeatedly prevents many diseases from spreading, for example, the genetic pathways of the mouth of the spleen and the hives.
People can also be a victim of respiratory diseases such as flu or common rash, for example, if they do not wash their eyes, nose, or mouth before touching (i.e. mushrooms).
There are five essential times in a day when washing hands with soap is imperative: before and after cleaning the home, after cleaning the baby’s bottom or changing the depot, before feeding the baby, before and after cooking the food, or after cutting the meat, fish or chicken.
If water and soap are not available, the hands can also be cleaned from rubbish.The World Health Organization has given the following advice for hand washing:
Before, during and after eating.
Before and after the patient’s treatment.
After changing the dipper or cleaning the child using the toilet.
After cleansing, swallowing or rubbing.
after the breastfeeding of animals, animal food or animal milk.
Health care should be carried out in accordance with the principles of health care.
Washing hands before eating or taking medication may stop or decrease the spread of the disease.
The primary purpose of medical hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other food contaminants that cause disease) and chemicals that can damage or spread disease.
This is especially for those who are affiliated with the food or medicine sector, but it is also a good habit for the general public.
Hand washing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other multiple diseases; preventing causes of respiratory disease; reducing respiratory infection;
And the children who are born in the house will have to die.
A 2013 study shows that hand washing habits are slightly better for children under five years of age.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce child deaths from respiratory and respiratory diseases, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple procedure can reduce deaths from these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can lead to a third reduction in the rate of death from stroke events, and can be compared with the provision of clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing by soap is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent heart disease and severe respiratory infections (ARI).It is an automated procedure that can be used in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Ammonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under the age of five, killing approximately 1.8 million children each year.
Sickness and sampling both cause the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, by changing the habit of washing hands before and after eating into a natural secondary, more lives can be saved than by using a vaccine or introducing it in medical terms, i.e. half the deaths due to stroke and a fourth decrease in deaths due to severe respiratory infections.
Hand washing is generally part of other health and cleaning things, i.e. water, sewage water and health conservation program (WASH).
Hand washing also protects you from rapid tumors that move straight from the mil-joule.
A small damage to washing hands is that it can damage the skin quickly from washing hands again and again.
According to a 2012 study in Denmark, handwashing can be more prone to irritation, which is known as skin burn, and is commonly found in people related to the medical sector.
Repeated hand washing is also seen as an OCD (Over-needed Discomfort Symbol).
There are five subtle times a day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the disease spreading through the stomach and mouth: after using the bathroom (e.g. the bathroom), after cleaning the baby from the bottom (the change of the depth), before eating the baby, before and after eating and before and after preparing the food or before and after cutting the meat, fish or chickens.
Other occasions when hands should be properly washed in order to avoid the transmission of the disease include: before and after the injury; after cutting, eating or cleaning the nose; after handling the animal's air or animal care; and after hand-lacking the cricket.
In many countries, the rate of washing hands with soap is very low.
According to a survey of handwashing in 54 countries in 2015, an average of 38.7% of people living in homes were washing their hands with soap. According to a 2014 study, this rate is the highest in Saudi Arabia, 97 percent; among them are the United States, 77 percent; and the lowest rate in China, 23 percent.
The mandatory “Health Protection Program” implemented by sector education in the Philippines is an example of the mass promotion of children’s health and education.
This national program includes washing your hands twice a year with soap and cleaning your teeth daily with fluoride.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
In the process of removing the pests from the skin, soap and detergents are better placed in the water.
The real function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barrier to being analyzed and increase the spread of the solution.
Only water is insufficient for cleansing the skin because the clay and protein, which are components of organic soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning, however, is aided by the proper flow of water.
In solid soap, bacteria may be present due to previous use due to reuse.
Several researchers who have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soap say that this transfer cannot happen because the bacteria goes out with the bark.
The CDC again says that “liquid soap without tooth control is preferable.”
Health-related antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted in the public.
So far, there is no evidence that the use of recommended pesticide medicines in nature produces anti-biotic resistant organic organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic biologies.
So if antibacterial soaps don’t choose antimicrobial resistant, they won’t be as effective as they’ve been told.
In addition to moisturizing substances and skin conservation factors, the more fertile formed can also include PH regulators, bacterially active benzoic acids (acetic acid, scorpionic acid, lactic acid), and skin condensers (loyale, vitamin, mineral, plant proteins). According to a detailed analysis of the University of Oregon, School of Public Health, simple soaps are just as active as antibacterial soaps for all users that produce triglycerides that protect against diseases and remove bacteria from the hands.
The hot water in the hand is not so hot that it can kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, natural oil, which absorbs soil and bacteria, is more effective in removing semi-hot, soap-free water than cold soap-free water.
However, contrary to popular belief, a scientific study says that half-hot water is not effective in reducing harm from hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic non-water-based hand preservation health agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand cleaning agents without water (alcohol-based hand cleaning agents, also known as antimicrobial hand cleaning agents or hand teasers) began to gain fame.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohols or ethanol which are mixed into a car factor, such as carbomer (a poly-healthy compound of multi-acrylic acids) into a gel-forming substance or a moisturizing item, such as glycerin, for ease of use and reduction of the soil effect of alcohol.
The addition of oxides to the dissolved hydrogen increases the anti-microbial activity of the hand-sweetened teasers in which the alcohol content is 60 to 95% effective antibacterial resistance.
Alcoholic sinus thyroids kill bacteria, multi-drug-protective bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhino viruses, vaccines, influenza, hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcoholic teasers with a %70 alcohol content (3.5 decrease in logs, which is equivalent to 35 decrease in decibels) kill %99.97 bacteria 30 seconds after use and kill bacteria 1 minute after use from %99.99 to %99.999 (4.5 decrease in logs).
Alcohol-based hand teasers are almost completely ineffective for neural viruses or (Norwalk), which are the most common cause of multiple diseases of small intestinal inflammation.
Wash the front and rear parts of both hands and the middle and final parts of all fingers for approximately 30 seconds until the material, barrel or gel is dry.
Fingers should also be thoroughly washed and scratched on both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with a teaser, especially when the hands are apparently contaminated.
The reason for the acceleration in the use of such materials is their ease of use and the ability to kill bacteria quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to official handwashing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-based teasers can dry faster than used, until the formula contains cream and/or skin-galling ingredients.
Glycerin and/or other creams may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical experiments have shown that by using alcohol-based hand teasers containing cream, compared to soap or anti-microbial detergents, the skin is less burned and dried.
In the case of excessive sensitivity to various acute diseases or alcohol, or because of the inclusion of toxic substances in the alcohol, sometimes there may be complaints of laryngitis.
Their hands were washed with soap and water, and they tended toward them because they were less likely to be sick than those who were sick.
Despite their effective pen, they can not clean organic materials without water agents, they only clean them from pests.
Therefore, hand-sweetened teasers are not more effective than soap and water for preventing the spread of many bacteria, because the bacteria live on the hand.
Most of the effectiveness of a clean-alcohol hand teaser is dependent on the component and composition, and historically it hasn’t been very effective.
In recent days, the compounds in which benzenic chloride has been used, unlike alcohol, have seen overall antimicrobial activity after use, and a decrease in its performance has occurred after repeated use, possibly due to reactions produced in the skin.
A lot of people in the small households do not buy soap and use soap or soil instead.
Rice and soil can only be more effective than water, but less than soap.
There is a risk that if the soil or grain is contaminated by a germ, it may increase the risk of disease instead of decreasing.
Like soap, garlic is an eliminating agent because it creates an alkali solution after mixing it with water.
WHO recommends the use of soap or soil without soap.
The correct method of handwashing recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, so as to prevent the spread of the disease, includes the following:
Wash your hands with warm or cold water.
The flowing water is recommended because standing water can be polluted, when the temperature of the water does not differ.
Shake hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of the hands, the middle parts of the fingers and the lower parts of the nails.
Soap removes bacteria from the skin, and research has found that people wash their hands better when they only use soap instead of water.
At least 20 seconds.
It creates a fist, which helps to remove the germs quickly, and removes the germs longer than it can.
Clean the water well.
Hands can be contaminated again by washing in the basin.
Clean it out of dry water or leave it dry.
Gals and worn hands can easily be re-infected.Generally left-out parts include the ankle, ankle, spaces between the fingers and the surroundings of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-authentic nail polish can be infected with germs.
Inhaling lotions are generally recommended to protect hands from drought; dry skin can damage the skin, which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Where tons of water and/or soap are not available, many low-cost facilities can be provided for them, such as a sealed container or local vegetable with suitable holes, draining water and/or using rocks in developing countries if necessary.
tippy-tap is a simple technology that consists of a jade that is attached to a strap and a leather that moves through the legs that spills a little water on a speck of hands and soap.
Efficiently drying hands is part of the health process, but discussions are about what is the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
Most research suggests that paper clothes are better than electrical drills, which are often found in shelters.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, hosted a research, sponsored by the paperworking industry, the European Tissue Symposium, which included paperworking, heated hand drawers and modern jet air drawers in terms of preservative health ratings.
After hand washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the rate of bacteria on the fingers increased by an average of 194% and 254% on the arms.
The resulting drying from the Jet Air drill increased the bacterial rate by 42% on the fingers and 15% on the arms.
After handwashing and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the toes of the fingers decreased by an average of 76% and on the arms by 77%. scientists also tested to prove whether each type of drying process resulted in the ability to spread pollution into the surroundings of other washrooms and washrooms.
The jet air detector, which discharges air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has the ability to discharge the infection from the hands and unit and can contaminate the environment of other users of the detector and the detector up to a distance of 2 meters.
The heated hand dryer can spread the infection up to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
No specific pathogens spread from the tissue.In a 2005 study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were reviewed.
The following changes occurred in the number of bacteria after drying hands:
There are many different dryer manufacturers with many hand dryers, and the comparison of dryers is made from paper tiles.
In the absence of soap and water during travel, hand washing is an alternative to sliced paper.
Alcohol-based teasers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing was made necessary by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1846) after discovering its effectiveness in the hospital environment.
There are electrical devices that feed back the staff of the hospital so that when they forget, they are reminded to wash their hands.
According to a study, their use resulted in a reduced rate of infection.
Medical handwashing is for at least 15 seconds, soap and water or gel should be used in a certain amount to wipe and rub each part of the hand.
The fingers of the hands are attached to each other.
If there is mildness in the nails of the fingers, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since pests can remain in the water in the hands, it is necessary to rinse them well with water and dry them with a clean cloth.
After drying, the paper can be used to shut down the water (and if necessary to open the back door).
After this, the hands will not be contaminated again.
Handwashing in health care arrangements aims to remove pyogenic microorganisms ("bacteria") and prevent their transfer.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine report, the rate of hand washing in the medical environment is unacceptably low, with a large number of doctors and nurses usually forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus becoming a source of genetic transmission.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple practices reduce the rate of infection associated with prostatitis by up to 66%.The World Health Organization has published a paper showing the correct way to wash hands and meet hands in the health sector.
Hand cleaning draft guidelines from the agency can be viewed on their website for public comment.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can test and verify the health and cleanliness of hands, if it is deemed necessary.
The World Health Organization has identified the “five ways” of handwashing:
Treatment of blood/body moisture
before the death, and
After taking care of the patient, the addition of antimicrobial chemicals (medicated or "antimicrobial" soaps) in the soap is used to kill the bacteria.
There is a need for such antimicrobial treatment where the anti-biotic resistance is much higher before or after surgery.For the operation, it is necessary to have a hand "break" that can be opened and closed without being touched by the hand, sprayed with chlorhexidine or iodine, sprayed with chlorhexidine after hand washing, sprayed with chlorhexidine after washing, sprayed with chlorhexidine after washing, sprayed with chlorhexidine after washing, and sprayed with chlorhexidine after washing.
All jewelry is removed.
In this process, the hands are washed from the mouth to the limbs, usually 6-2 minutes.
There is no need to wait for 10 minutes.
When the water is drained on the side of the arm, it is believed that it will not return to the hands.
When the hands are dried, the hands are dried with clean clothes and the circular garments are worn.
To reduce the spread of the bacteria, it is better to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or put bacteria on the hands.
In order to overcome staphylococcal infection in hospitals, research has found that the most benefits of hand cleansing came from the first %20 dust, and that when this rate was increased by %35 there were very few additional benefits.
In addition to bacterial multiple disease transmission in the diet, the use of simple soap showed three times the effect of antibacterial soap compared to the use of simple soap. Alcohol-based solution and antibacterial soap compared each to 30 seconds of handwashing, it was found that antibacterial soap compared to alcohol by handwashing caused a 26% decrease in bacterial contamination.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based solutions to remove H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands. If hand health and cleanliness are improved in health-related areas, this will require staff training for hand washing, alcohol-based solutions available for hands, and staff written and verbal reminders.
In addition, more research is needed to see how measures are more effective in different health-related settings.
Handwashing from soap in developing countries is considered to be a source of low cost, good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of constant supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities in people’s homes, schools and workplaces is a major challenge to adopt the global handwashing habit of all people.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is very common to have a hand washing toilet near a private or public toilet, while many low-cost cases of making hand washing spaces are possible.
However, the rate of hand washing may be reduced due to the use of soap and water instead of the habit of cooking.
Handwashing with soap can influence the promotion and promotion of decision making, generate awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and generate profound changes in population behavior.
It is necessary to be vigilant and vigilant to do so.
An official study of 70 students found that LMICs are more effective at working in a particular community, whereas the social marketing chain is less effective.One of the ways in which UNICEF promotes handwashing in schools is the “three-star approach,” which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students are washing their hands with soap in addition to other conservative health principles.
When they reach the lowest level, the scale can reach the second and then the third star.
Making hands-washing spots can be part of the cleansing chain of handwashing, which aims to reduce the number of diseases and deaths in children.
World Handwashing Day is another example of awareness-raising, aimed at changing behavior as a result of the 2019-20 global outbreak of the coronavirus, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Some researches have suggested that the overall cost of hand washing is lower in developing countries by ignoring DALYs.
However, according to a review, promoting hand washing from soap, compared with the management of water and its output, carries less cost.
The importance of handwashing for human health—especially for those in unsafe circumstances, such as those who have just given birth to a baby or wounded soldiers in hospitals—was first recognized by conservatives in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian fictionalist Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the second Englishman Florence Nightingale who is “the founder of the new nursing.”
At that time, most people still thought that infection was the cause of malnutrition.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to food-related diseases and public health-related infections further promoted hand cleaning as a major source of preventing the spread of the infection.
Swedish flu in 2009 and the global spread of COVID-19 in 2020 have promoted the awareness in many countries that handwashing with soap is essential to prevent multiple diseases.
For example, posters with “right-hand washing techniques” were attached to hand-washing spaces outside public homes, to the toilets of office buildings and to the airports in Germany.
The phrase “washing one’s hands of” means that no one declares responsibility for anything or does not say anything.
This term relates to the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed disrespect for the decision to put Jesus on the seat, but it later became commonplace in the English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare’s drama Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to keep her hands washed in an attempt to clean up an imaginary thunderstorm, which reveals her conscience shattered by the crime of killing her husband.
It has also emerged that people, after reminding of unethical practices or considering them, wash their hands more than others, and attach great importance to handwashing.
More evil is that those who wash their hands after such thoughts will take part in other activities of "freedom", such as pleasant work.
Madhab conservatives also recommend hand washing under health and symbolic purposes.Sign hand washing, i.e. the use of water without soap for hand washing, is characterized by many Madhab: for example, the Buddhist religion, Hinduism, Toila in Judaism, Nathelite Memorial, Lavrov in Christ and Islam.Madhab conservatives suggest hand washing according to health, especially after some activities.
Handwashing is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
Do not wash your hands before and after every meal; in Judaism and Islam it is mandatory to wash your hands before and after every meal.
Overcoming risks at workplaces for COVID-19
Practically shape occupational safety and health-related measures to overcome risks at workplaces for COVID-19 to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate management of risks in the workplace depends on the workplace and the nature of the workplace, the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and those workers who may be unsafe for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-disclosed risk jobs are those in which there is a minimum of professional contact with the public and other drivers, for which basic measures are suggested to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, breathing habits, and keeping the work environment clean and infectious.
Middle exposure risks are those jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to be affected by COVID-19, but may be affected by social transfers and international travel.
This includes those workers who are in contact with the public, such as in schools, the working environment in the Treasury population and the number of places in which they work.
In addition to the basic protective measures to prevent infection for this grass, high-performance air filters to overcome the danger include air intake, protection from cracks, and personal protective equipment if an affected person is exposed to COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health care of the affected or suspected person and the appearance of the deceased household workers to be a subordinate risk, the risk of exposure is too high if employees perform the process of producing aerosol or collect or process samples from known or suspected persons with COVID-19.
Appropriate measures shall be taken for these workers to cope with the risks, such as negative pressure rooms for air intake and exit, and personal protective equipment depending on the nature of the work.
There are many possible effects of COVID-19 on the workplace.
Workers may be out of attendance due to the prediction of the risk of getting sick, the protection of others, or the fear of being exposed to the disease.
The methods of trading can vary, both in terms of demand for items and in terms of obtaining them (such as buying at low altitude times, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, geographically, equipment from areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be dispersed to migratory areas, and a plan for preparedness and response to multiple diseases can be used to guide protective actions.
Projects identify risk levels associated with different workplaces and employment tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and fraternity arrangements, and risk factors for individual workers such as aging or permanent medical conditions.
They also outline the ways to overcome and the emergency plans for the resulting situation that are necessary to overcome these dangers.
Plans for preparation and response to multiple diseases may be the subject of national or regional advice.
Reduce the transfer between staffs for the purposes of reacting to a web, protect those at risk of poor health complications, and reduce the negative impact on business activities and supply.
The workplace in the community affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The Risk Overcoming Classification Framework is widely used in professional safety and health, so that group risks can be effectively overcome.
Where the dangers of COVID-19 can’t be eliminated, there are the most effective controlled controls, followed by administrative controls, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Configured control is to separate employees from work-related risks, without relying on their behavior, and this can be the least costly solution for implementation.
The policy and procedures of work relating to administrative control, which require the process from the employee or owner, are changed.
Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is considered less efficient than engineering and administrative controls, but some may help prevent the appearance.
All types of PPE should be selected by workers subsequently based on the risks, properly installed, if applied (such as a solventing device), continuously and properly worn, sustainably painful and replaced, whatever is necessary, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or damaged to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are at least in professional contact with the public and other workers.
Basic measures recommended to prevent infection in all workplaces include repeatedly and thoroughly washing hands, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing habits, including mouth cleansing when eating and cracks, cleaning tissues and cracks, talking on the phone or managing a barrier presence if necessary, removing employees from using other people’s devices and tools, and cleaning and sanitizing the workplace as usual.
The recognition and separation of potentially multiple persons is a worrying step toward protecting employees, customers, employees and others at work.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home until the symptoms of fever, fever, or any other symptoms end without using medications to reduce fever or other symptoms for at least 24 hours, and that disease licensing policies are flexible, allowing employees to care for the sick person in the family, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium-risk exposure are those jobs in which people who are unknown to be suspected or affected by COVID-19 require close or continuous contact from a distance of six feet (1.8 meters), but may be affected either by SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission near the business, or because the individual has a recent international trip where COVID-19 has been widely transmitted.
This includes those workers who have contact with the public, such as schools, work environments in vulnerable populations and more vulnerable locations. This includes installing high-performance limited air filters to control more vulnerable groups, encouraging sick workers to stay at home, changing material barriers from shutdowns to plastic guards, and installing drive tripods for customer service. This and administrative control for high-risk groups is intended to encourage sick workers to stand up at home, turn the meeting in front of safety barriers to talk, come to work on a heavy duty, install locations where COV-19ID continues to prevent unnecessary travel, and use environmental indicators or talk indicators to provide sexual protection plans to reduce threats, to provide and protect employees who want to, in accordance with the type of work, work, formulate and educate employees who have access to, or have access to, COV-19 classified errors.
Risk workers in this group are exposed to the use of respiratory devices.
If a person gets sick on an airplane, appropriate controls are intended to save employees and other passengers, to separate the sick person from others up to a distance of 6 feet, to assign a member of the staff to the patient, and to offer the sick person a face mask or tell the patient to eat or shake his mouth and hand tissue.
When returning from a sick passenger or covering body moisture or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear a disposable handcuff and potentially additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has difficulty swallowing, constant eating, or breathing.
For commercial vessels, including cruise vessels and other passenger vessels, overcoming the risk of being forced to travel in case of illness, and immediately informing the medical center on board of the vessel if the vessel is isolated from the vessels or any other signs appear.
The high point is that medical follow-up is in the patient’s cabin. The CDC recommends shutdown for a short time for schools and child care centers that if any affected person has come into the school building, even if he has not spread the virus, it should be cleaned or cleaned from the infection.
When the virus is transmitted from small to medium-sized, social-distance strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large communities such as physical exhibition or music classes, or discharging food in a cafe terrace, increasing the distance between desks, limiting arrival and vacation times, avoiding unnecessary activities, and using a separate health office for children who have symptoms such as abortion.
When there is a considerable amount of transfer in the local community, shutdowns for the length of the schools can also be considered in addition to the social distance strategy. law enforcement staff who are carrying out their daily activities, according to the CDC, are considered to be at a lower risk of immediate health for them.
Law enforcement officers, who are or suspected of contacting persons with COVID-19, are advised to follow the guiding principles that apply to emergency tech, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during anxiety, workers should clean their duty belt and gear from impurities using domestic cleaning spray or spray before reuse, and follow the standard procedure for importing the use and content of used PPE and the standard procedure for damaging and washing clothes.
According to OSHA, some health centers and deceased household workers are more or less at risk of exposure.
More exposed jobs include health-related delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers facing known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become more exposed when employees take on the virus-making action, or collect or administer samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the operation of producing a serum, inserting the kidneys, eating-related procedures, examining the throat nodules, some procedures and tests related to the teeth, or collecting random samples.
More exposure-threatened jobs in the deceased house include workers who produce the deceased bodies of those who were known or suspected to have had COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional positioned gauge controls, including separate gauge rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when the process of making the virus is followed.
In some health centers and dead homes, special negative pressure air intake and exit devices may be suitable.
The samples should be screened under Biosafety Level 3 protective measures.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated in specific waiting spaces depending on whether they are suspected of COVID-19 cases.In addition to other PPEs, OSHA recommends device respiration for those who work at a distance of 6 feet from a known patient or a suspected individual of SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform the virus-making operation.
In the light of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program in the United States, the NIOSH-approved N95 filtering device should be used for respiration or better, which includes appropriate testing, training and medical examination.
Other types of devices can provide better protection for breathing and improve worker’s comfort.WHO does not recommend completely detoxifying, because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease not transmitted by body moisture.
The WHO recommends only a surgical mask in the place of the entrance screen for staff.
Those who are taking respiratory samples, taking care of or transferring patients with COVID-19 without the process of making a virus, the WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or shells, garments and hands for the face.
If the serum-making procedure is performed, the N95 or FFP2 device takes breath instead of the circular mask.
Knowing that the global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, clean windows such as material barriers, only allowing those who are taking care of COVID-19 patients directly to enter the room, the use of PPE is essential for specific work, the use of the same device without breathing while taking care of many patients, the use of PPE spray China monitoring and management, and the use of masks for people without symptoms.

Subject: [Covid-19] Lower weight and prepare for the future
Date/Time of Submission: 14 March, 2020, 00:24UTC
Lawsing: CC0: No rights reserved
We are facing unusual events this month.
COVID-19’s global web is the one that has made it clear that humans are randomly connected and that we are connected to each other.
We don’t have any previous examples of such challenges, but we know well that our best response is the global sentiment, cooperation, and community-building that brings the spirit of the institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention we see in all of our cars in emails, phone calls and chats all confirm how lucky we are to work with amazing people.
I can’t be more grateful and proud that you are all my work.
Last week, someone thanked me for our work.
They reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to return to Wikipedia now, and how strong a sign for this subtle resource is that it is available online for everyone.
Your work has made it possible, whether you are with the sites or our car payments or our community stays secure.
The world needs information and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
It is not only what we do, but how we do it, which will have a meaningful effect on the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some major changes from this coming week to how we work.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn stated earlier, the C-team met last night to discuss our views and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered what would be the most appropriate response to what we face and how to keep the organization on our feet at that time.
We wanted to make a long-term break and to advance our mission.
If you want to do it, okay.
All staff, staff and staff:
For our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week, up to order second,
We’re not announcing holidays – if you can work according to the usual hours, the mission may bring you into use.
However, nothing can be said about the world at this time, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a trade quote, or go to the doctor, your kindness is our priority.
We are not tracking your time.
If you are sick, don’t work.
It doesn’t need to be said, but we are saying it.
Do not require sick days or PTOs – just tell your manager and help restore your team’s calendar and schedule, make sure all aspects of the work are done.
(If you get a positive assessment for COVID-19, please notify Bryan within T&C Ops, so T&C can help with the grant and make sure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation.)
Those who work for hours will be paid.
We have said this before, and we are repeating our responsibilities to our righteous servants and the staff who work by counting hours.
Everyone will be paid for their hours of meeting during the usual conditions.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we will help you.
Many people work around the world to bring about changes in their mental attitudes.
What we can do is incredibly useful, especially in such days.
Again, it’s all for your personal protection.
We just say that you talk to your manager, that we will estimate what to expect from you and then fix things accordingly.
No work is needed.
There are some things that we should keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (including others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We change our focus with all sectors to test recent goals and support what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot to do, all of us will only focus on extremely important projects.
We won’t be worried at this time.
We are not planning that once it passes worldwide, we will “complete it.”
You are not expected to work extra time to meet the deadlines, which is unrealistic at this time.
We acknowledge that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate we will work to fix new goals and timelines.
What is the plan?
In order to adjust our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we are committed to setting up our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We want to expand our 2019-2020 plan that takes too much time to create a budget where employees are allowed to change their work preferences, and their loved ones will be able to adjust to those in need who want to work for less time.
This expansion of time will greatly reduce the work and pressure of the existing planning in the entire institution.
We will present our plan to the Board next week and receive confirmation and inform delegates and teams about the next move.
Thank you for leading the team.
Office Status, Appearance and Cleaning
Last week, we heard that our one resident friend in the SF could be affected by COVID-19.
However, despite our extreme caution, we recruited staff in the San Francisco office for an anti-virus procedure so that all levels could be cleaned.
They used a hospital-grade herbicide solution to clean the arms of every level of the barracks and staircase through which our chest is accessed.
This building is using its own protocol products that provide the protection of its tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be fully ready at this time, so we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in Weber, where all DC Office staff members and our employees share their own COVID-19 protocol.
Until last week, our DC office went to a far-reaching location, according to San Francisco’s Sixth Joint Guidelines.
As the inhabitants of NWC know, we are renting a place in Brooklyn.
This is a delay, but it is a delay.
Our friends are working for the first time.
Our old-fashioned staff know that this can be a level of adjustment and want to give you a level of advice.
The length of the meetings can be extended from over one to two times.
If long sessions are needed, think about how to divide them over different days.
Clarify the meeting as each agenda, and first submit the reading content.
Create a video by default, using features such as Google Docs and Zoom for direct collaboration and communication.
Gain the advantage of providing cooperation for each meeting, someone should monitor the discussion for questions and follow the list of schedulers and someone to help take a note (or take a note with mutual cooperation).
If you need a relaxed headset, send an email to technical support.
Use your wealth and wealth for sinks.
Join the #Remoties channel in Silk to talk about shared work with your colleagues.
The HR operating team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to cooperate in the distributed car across the entire foundation.
Last week, we told all social media recipients to cancel Wikimedia’s concerned public events, such as Edadethans, until the World Health Organization announced the end of the global Ebola.
They should know that we understand that our cancellation request and other obligations make it possible to complete their accepted cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for adjusting or delaying these goals.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on WikiMania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feelings of the entire world brotherhood are obsessed with this disaster but satisfied with the clear ability to focus on their own brothers, Wikipedia, and so on.
As we move forward, CGT is working on creating a web page on MetaWiki to give the community the opportunity to track their communications and monitor their impact.
Related to Covid-19
We will send your caller an invitation for a special meeting next Friday 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT
We will use this time to share the most up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend as much time in contacting each other.
We will help each other as much as we can.
During this time, you can continue to receive information from this email and other necessary information related to COVID-19 on the office wiki.
This page will contain the most up-to-date and other information in one place.
We are working on establishing regular relationships with those staff members who are currently resident in countries that are sufficiently affected.
If you have travel, events, an important work schedule, or a curious challenge, or anything else you need help with, please do not show hesitation in working with the CRT and obtaining information.
We are here to provide cooperation and contact when necessary.
If you have any hidden or sensitive issue, please email Brian Jordan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of them should be seen as changing our work and responsibilities.
Rather, it is a time of knowledge, of our responsibilities and responsibilities in a way that we have not seen before.
These are measures we understand that they need to help each other so that we can continue to work, provide our movement with the cooperation it needs and the world with the service it relies on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us there.
Now, helping each other is time-consuming and taking the opportunity for important work that will come in the coming weeks but possibly in a few months.
We need all of you to do this, and that is why you all need to take care of yourself and your family so that you are in the best condition when necessary.
Now, please, swallow your bones and don’t chew your face!
Kathryn, the CRT (Amanda, EMI, Brian J. Dorin de, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L. L. L., Ryan M. and Tony S.) and the rest of the team’s leadership (Grand I, Head World), Jim V, Gene U, Lassa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Tobey N.).
B-Inguotensin - Enzyme 2-changing agent (ACE2) is an enzyme that is connected to the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the veins, veins, hearts, kidneys and anus.
ACE2-related enzyme-converting enzyme (ACE) competing by reducing the level of angiotensin II and increasing the level of angiotensin (1-7) makes it a reliable drug for the treatment of heart disease.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
The angiotensin-converting enzyme is a type of 2-chor that includes methalonazole found at the endothelial level and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein consists of an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I molecular protein, which overlooks its molecular active domain at the cellular level in the follicles and other vertebrae.
The domain outside the ACE2 cells is cleaved from the trans membrane domain called shadesis by another enzyme, and as a result the soluble protein is left in the bloodstream which eventually goes out through the vein.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is mainly linked to type II fungal cells, small antineoplastic interstitials, arterial and viral endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells.
The effects of ACE2MRNA are also found in the outer intestine of the brain, body shaped, down to the small finger, in the brain system.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an anti-balance agent of ACE.
ACE inhibits the hormone inhibitor I in the closed blood vessels of inhibitor II.
In return, the ACE2 carboxyl terminal amino acid phenylylene separates it from injectains II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into vasodilator injectains (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides including [DES-ARG 9] -bradecane, aphenone, neurotensin, denorphine A, and chiralene.
ACE2 also controls the transmission and load of the natural amino acid-bearing SLC6A19 and is involved in brain mental illness.
As a protein transgender, ACE2 acts as a central intruder in several coronavirus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2’s spike S1 protein-cell levels in the enzymatic domain of ACE2 cause the blockage of spikes to swallow into a cell’s intestinal material and transport into both viral and enzymatic cells.
In this process of intervention, the representative serum protein TMPRSS2 also requires the priority of propionate, which continues to be a potential treatment under current research.Some have concluded that by reducing the level of ACE2 in cells, it can be easier to counter the disease.
However, many professional professionals and organizational agencies have advised the general ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy not to continue.
A regulated review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 found that “the use of ACE barrier was associated with a 34% reduction in the risk of sampling compared to control.”
Furthermore, the risk of sampling b among those patients treated with ACE blockage, who were at highest risk of sampling b, especially those with heart failure and heart failure, also decreased.
ACE barriers are associated with fewer deaths related to the sample, although the results were less strong than the overall risk of the sample.”
Human-binding ACE2 (rhACE2) is widely referred to as a modern treatment for severe ulcers in the pelvis, and it has been shown that a lipopolycyride milk improves the supply of hemodynamics and oxygen with severe breathing difficulties symptoms.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 minutes and the action begins in 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour effect (durante).
Several findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a better medicine for people suffering from intolerance to the classical run-injection system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in diseases where the circulation of injection II is excessive—the rise in rhACE2 emissions has been diagnosed during medical trials for treating severe breathing.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile apps that help communicate during the 2019-20 worldwide coronavirus cycle, such as the process of identifying people ("links") who have been in contact with a conventional individual.
With the support of the official government, a number of applications have been created or proposed in various areas and sectors.
Several applications frameworks have been developed to find the contact.
Privacy concerns have been revealed, about the system, to find the app’s user’s geographical location.
The low-input alternative includes the use of Bluetooth signals so that the user’s location can be transferred to another mobile phone.
Google and Apple jointly announced on April 10, 2020 that they will cooperate to connect Bluetooth-based apps directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out whether or not they were in contact with a COVID-19-related person.
They are used in more than 200 cities in China, and the app Trace Together is being used in Singapore.
This app was created by a local IT brotherhood, which was released as a free source and will be referenced to the government. Northern Macedonia has launched a blockchain-based app called "Stop Corona!" that identifies the potential proximity of people and can provide immediate response to health-related authorities.
This app was developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
By April 14, 2020, the app is expected to be approved by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-seeking app is in the next phase of preparation and will be available for implementation within a week – in Ireland and France it is planned to install this type of app (“stop code”).
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering the development of applications based on Singapore’s Trace Together App and Blutris Protocol – Russia remains committed to introducing the Geofensing App to patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Moscow, to ensure that people don’t get out of their homes.
Russ Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, identified a number of possible practical problems in app-based systems, including false-positive results and the likelihood of low impact, if the use of the app was limited to a small segment of the population.
Overlooking concerns about the spread of the false or harmful “coronavirus” app, Apple has set limits on the types of organizations that may include coronavirus-related applications in their app store, limiting them to “governmental” or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have made the same.
Privacy experts have expressed their concerns about the countless surveillance restrictions on the Coronavirus app, whether the surveillance arrangements set up to address the global web will be removed after the end of this risk.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on surveillance.
These agencies have announced eight terms on government plans:
Surveillance should be “legal, necessary and appropriate”;
Observation and observation should be extended for a certain period of time:
The use of the data will be limited only to the purpose of COVID-19;
Data protection and non-disclosure will be reserved and protection will be shown on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance must avoid excessively discriminatory behavior and rendering it unimportant;
Any third-party data must be disclosed under the law of sharing;
Protective measures against violations will be taken and citizens will have the right to respond to violations;
All “relevant partners” will be required to actively participate, including public health experts and a non-relevant group, Germany’s Case Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also released monitoring lists.
Google/Apple’s licensed plan intends to solve the problem of independent monitoring by ending the monitoring procedure from its operating system device, when it won’t be needed.
Many countries used a network-based location monitoring system instead of an app, which eliminated both the need to download the app and the ability to avoid monitoring.
Israel has adopted a network-based surveillance system.
Network-based solutions, which provide access to localization data, are likely to have major privacy concerns.
Nevertheless, all systems connected to the central servers do not need access to personal location data; multiple privacy protection systems are designed to use only the central servers to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system is used for connecting.
Instead of using a better app, the system collects surveillance information from various sources including monitoring data and exchanges data from cards on mobile devices, and collects them all to develop notifications through text messages for potentially unusual people.
In addition to using this information, the government has made the location information publicly available to the public in order to inform the potential connections, which is what was permitted due to dramatic changes in the privacy laws of information at the time when MERS’s web appeared in the country.
This information is available to the public through multiple applications and websites – countries like Germany have considered both central and privacy protection systems.
The details were not disclosed until April 6, 2020.
Privacy-protected contact monitoring is a better idea, with a substantial history of research literature dating back to at least 2013. by April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) that would potentially lead the user to enter the location from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a joint effort that consists of both central and non-centric methods, and it is not a single protocol.The non-centric protocol includes: non-centric privacy protection monitoring (DP-PPT / DP-3T), contact temporary number (TCN ,fka event contact number, CEN), sensitive privacy protocol and procedure for keeping in touch with mobile devices (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data is not disconnected from the device at all and is accessible to all.
The privacy group at MIT Media Laboratory is developing secure routes, a platform for collecting and using privacy protection techniques when collecting location or crossroad data to counter the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research by Gartus Abigail "App Goon Rog: Maintaining Personal Privacy in Web" which was released in March 2020.The second attempt to do so is the Safe Track Platform by INGMA MPC, a company developing privacy technology that was originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and visitors without any understanding of the privacy of this data.
On April 5, 2020, the World ICT Alliance founded groups that had been set up with the aim ofining the same views and widely violating protocols to reduce the spread of scores in order to activate the global mutual capability of surveillance and warning apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the government of Singapore announced that it had released a free-source application, the Blurries App, used by its government.
On April 10, 2020, Android and iOS mobile platform controllers, Google and Apple, announced a measure to connect, which, according to their claims, will protect privacy based on the matching of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy.
They also published statements of the original technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system intends to be implemented in three stages:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to deploy official privacy protection applications that search for the coronavirus.
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple intend to solve the continuous monitoring problems to the extent that the system is first distributed through operating system updates, and later removed in the same way when the danger is eliminated.
Changing a drug (which means changing the drug’s purpose, re-profiling, changing the function, or changing the treatment) means changing the medical condition of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease or using it for another disease instead of using it for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway for research into effective and safe treatments for COVID-19.
Other directions of the research include preparation and plasma transfer of COVID-19 vaccines.SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 medicable proteins, each of which is a multiannual site.
The analysis of these monthly sites provides an appropriate plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most promising of SARS-CoV-2 is the hydrophobic protein like popine, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymeris, helix, S-protein and ADP ribofosphate, protein.
Hussein A.A., Ethel, has revised and analyzed several studies of potential compounds with the highest approved drugs for similarity in their range, in order to accelerate the appearance of a strongly induced SARS-CoV-2 drug in its previous medical study, suggesting it to be included in the medical study design.

This treatment has not been approved by the FDA in the medical experimentation procedure and under the FDA only those patients who are admitted to the hospital but cannot be treated in any medical experiment are allowed to use it for preventive purposes.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosage, or periodicity of hydroxychloroquin for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 disease" has not yet been established.
Doctors say that this drug is used when “no other option remains.”
A Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a brief study on the use of chlorokin in the joint use of zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are ongoing at Duke University and Oxford University.
The N.Y.U. Longoon Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and usefulness of the cautious use of hydrochloricine.
Experiments by China in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Flavipiravir is “obviously” effective.
In Shenzhen, an average of 35 patients were negative in 4 days, while in those 45 patients the duration of the disease was 11 days for those who did not take the drug.
In a study of 240 sampled patients in Wuhan, half of the patients were given flavipiravir and half were given eumifenoids.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of this drug is very small and early.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use it through the military in university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China’s Morning Post, Shenzhou Abe has defeated the Trump administration over the purchase of this drug – the drug may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already grown.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant.
A study of Lupenovir/Retnavir, which is a compound of antiviral Lupenovir and Retinovir, has concluded that it has "no benefits seen."
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from being transferred by binding on proteins.
A group of researchers at the University of Colorado are trying to replicate into drugs to find a compound that will be linked to the proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community has criticized the replication of resources to replicating drugs, drugs developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included lupenovirus/retinovirus in the international coagulation test.
Remediation was promoted by Glide Science to prevent Ebola virus disease and to treat marble virus diseases – its subsequent Glide Science immediately discovered that anti-viral activity against multiple philo, fimo, paramyx and corona-viruses exists within Remediation.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the promotion of resistance through changes that can cause more serious disease and transition.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remediator resistance may have a higher genetic barrier, including several medical trials, which are administered by two Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with low illness and the other for people with severe illness.
For severe patients who are admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, there are three medical trials in the vitamin C reg: two controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The state of New York began testing of the Osteoporosis Antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCMM) is planning a medical trial for the Alvisco (Sylsonide) in Taiwan, which is a steroid hormone to inhale diabetic patients, treating patients affected by the coronavirus that did not show symptoms of the disease.
A phase II trial plan of a type of enzyme that changes Inguentin is a phase 2 trial plan that will select 200 serious patients admitted to hospitals in Denmark, Germany and Austria in order to determine the effects of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchamine in reducing inflammation and heartburn complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, which is called cholecourona, selected 6,000 adults over the age of 40, who had COVID-19 and showed normal symptoms but did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or women who are not pregnant, are not spouses.
In Italy, a number of blood tests are being carried out.
Low-physical-weight jiggers and peaches are widely used for the treatment of patients, who have warned the Italian Medicine Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
On April 14, a multi-centric study of 300 patients investigating the use of inoxparin sodium in prevention and treatment was announced in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, all scientific attention has been directed to re-create approved antiviral medicines such as those developed to spread the previously erupted MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin is recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to China’s 7 edition guide.
U. Mefinoir: China's 7 edition guidelines suggested ribavirin for treatment of COVID-19.
Some antibiotics that have been potentially reusable for the treatment of COVID-19:
TOCLIZOMB (anti-IL-6 receiver): Approved by China
Tests also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19
COVID-19 is a vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed medical experiments, there are many efforts to develop this vaccine.

In April, CEIP scientists that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I protection studies include several major platform objectives:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I Developers and Vaccine Candidates: Moderna, MRNA -1273)
Viral vector (Developers and vaccine candidates of Stage I: Mine Seno Biology, Adeno Virus Type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of preparation for vaccine, 78 are certified as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and another 37 have announced but very little public information about them is available (estimated to be in the planning phase or underway by sub-design).
Phase I-II experiments are initial protection and resilience examinations, generally without configuration, controlled by the drug’s harmless substance, and occur on multiple sites, while determining more accurate, effective dosages.
Phase III experiments typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the impact of vaccine testing to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects on higher doses.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active preparation (certified by the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet detectable on humans (already in the "pre-trial" study).

Some vaccines have different effects, which are also called non-specific effects.
It means that they can have the benefits of this disease in addition to what they want to avoid.
4,170 medical practitioners are being enrolled for another random experiment in Australia.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or spread during the preparatory phases.
Initial research to test the usefulness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal samples, such as ACE2-Donsley cattle, other laboratory animals, and non-human higher creatures, indicates the need for international coherence to ensure biological protection measures of grade 3 to deal directly with the virus, and standard protection methods.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in non-human animal models.
Until 2020, no protective vaccine or treatment for SARS has been discovered that is safe and effective in humans.
According to a research paper published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and preparation of Nolvacin and drugs for the treatment of SARS is being preferred by governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS was introduced, it was assumed that current SARS research would be an effective sample in the treatment and preparation of vaccines against MERS-CoV disease.
By the end of March 2020, a MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has completed Phase I medical experiments on humans, and three other released vaccines, all of which are vectorized viral vaccine vaccines, two adrenal vaccine vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vaccinated (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a controversial theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and its vaccine is already available.
Various social media posts have shown patents that refer to existing patents for genetic chains and vaccines and other coronavirus species such as SARS coronavirus.
Bacterial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a multiple disease that causes severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include vomiting, gout and breathing retardation.
Other symptoms include upset, pain in the legs, discomfort, burning in the throat, termination of the sensation of swelling and pain in the abdomen.
From appearance to the onset of symptoms, it usually takes five days, but can last from two to four days.
Although in most cases the symptoms of the disease are of a normal nature, the rate goes to viral sampling and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been from 210 countries and regions, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been infected – mainly this virus infects people through close contact with the public, often in the form of mouth-to-mouth cuddles when lying, chatting or talking.
Although when breathing out, the same buds come out, but they are mostly scattered on the ground or on the ground, instead they can spread illness from a long distance.
Those who suffer from this disease may be afflicted with their bones, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive up to 72 miles on the surface.
It is the most common disease within three days before the onset of symptoms, although its spread can be repeated in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is the RRT-PCR (rRT-PCR).
The use of the mask is advised to those who are suspicious of being affected by the virus and are people with health problems.
There are differences in the recommendations for people to wear masks, how many advocates are against their use, how much they recommend their use and how much they consider it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has recorded local transmission of the disease in most countries in all four regions.
People with the virus may not have apparent symptoms or may have symptoms such as vomiting, gout, numbness and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, frequent pain or pressure in the chest, mental distress, difficulty waking, and the bleeding of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, urgent medical attention is advised.
In the upper part of the breath, symptoms of illness such as sneezing, nausea or throat burning can be seen.
Symptoms of migraine diseases such as methyl, caia and ischias were observed in various percentages.
In China, in the beginning, several events only occurred in the face of breast tension and tenderness.
In many cases, this disease can lead to sampling, excessive organ failure and death.
It is called an incubator.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms of the disease will be affected within 11.5 days.
Without symptoms, the extent of these affected people is not fully known; however, early evidence suggests that they can be carried by the disease.
The proportion of people affected by the disease is currently unknown where no symptoms appear and what is being studied, where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) has that 20% of all cases confirmed during hospitalization go without symptoms.
China’s National Health Commission began counting out-of-symptoms events in its daily cases on April 1st, with 130 (78%) of 166 normal patients unnoticed during the test.
There can be a lot of viral loads in both of them.
There is much more to talk about than to talk about.
A study in Singapore found that without a dungeon, a cane has the ability to walk up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) in a bucket.
Although this is not a virus, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that bioresonance may be possible and that samples of viral RNA have been positively obtained among those collecting air outside the rooms of individuals.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can erosolyze respiratory moistures and thus spread to the air.
Now, while the concerns are that it spreads by air, this danger is underestimated.When symptoms appear in people, the virus is most multiplied; and if the spread of the virus is possible even before the symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that now, while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally affects two to three people.
In particular, it was found to be viable for one day on viruses, for three days on plastics (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for four hours on 99% towels.
However, it does not change in terms of temperature.
If soaps and detergents are used correctly, they are effective; soap products disable the virus-infesting protective frame, as well as cleanse the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, chloride benzoconium chloride and chlorosidine gluconate, are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, bulk samples were taken in an average of two days after entering the hospital.
In five of the six patients, the most viral loads were seen in the first sample, and the sixth patient saw the most viral amounts in the second-day test.
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a severe non-respiratory disease coronavirus, which was first detected in three people in Wuhan with severe respiratory diseases.
All the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus related in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by soap, which breaks out its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is originally similar to SARS-CoV.
Pineapples are the organs that are most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses those host cells through the enzyme ACE2 (the enzyme that converts the angiotensin), which is most commonly found in Pineapples type II pineapples.
The virus uses a specific level of sugar cells called "collagen" (peppler) to infect ACE2 and enters the host cell.
Twelve percent of those who entered hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan suffered from severe heart injury and frequently suffered from severe illnesses.
Inflammation and disease occurring throughout the body increase the rate of heart symptoms due to defensive system diseases, but severe heart muscle damage in the heart can also be associated with ACE2 binding agents.
2ACE are overly visible in the heart and are involved in the action of the heart.
Patients in the extreme monitoring unit affected by COVID-19 had more cases of blood clotting in the intestines (31%) and thyroid bombardment (25%) and could be associated with poor diagnosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 causes ACE2 to cause the appearance of inflammatory cells in the respiratory tract, severe patients affected by COVID-19 have more inflammatory symptoms than usual.
In particular, the SM-CSF-secreted T-shapes in patients affected by COVID-19 were seen to be associated with the use of an inflamed IL-6 cell in patients affected by COVID-19 and severe pneumoniae.
At the time of the post-marathon, information about long-range cell interference has been obtained.
The WHO has published several methods for testing the disease.
The standard method of experimentation is reverse transcription polymers-chine reaction (rRT-PCR) over time.
The test is generally done on breath humidity samples obtained from the creation of infertility; of course, nose humidity or bulk samples can also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
A blood test can be used, but it requires taking two samples in two weeks and the immediate significance of the results decreases.
Chinese scientists have succeeded in isolating a type of coronavirus and published a genetic arrangement so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymer chain reactions (PCR) to detect multiple diseases caused by coronavirus.
By April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which detects active multiple diseases and whether or not someone has been affected in the past) was in the preparation phase, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test experiment showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first care testing center for use in the United States at the end of the month on March 21, 2020.The Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan issued assessment guidelines for the detection of Ebola, taking into account its medical properties and biological risks.
In the early multi-disease, bipolar multi-home, ground-glass optices are clearly environmental, inappropriate and subsequently divided inflammation.
As the disease increases, complete overwhelmingness, crizzy ping (the thickness of the chest is similar to the variable chest) and stability can appear.
Some statistics are available about COVID-19’s hypertension and pathophysology.
Important clinical results on post-marathon:
Microscopy: Burning of the spleen, burning of the heart, stability of the spleen and swelling of the spleen.
Four types of viral sampling severity can be seen:
Light sampling: with fluorescent oxidation, the formation of more neoplasms, large unusual neoplasms, shaggy inflammation with the inflammation of long cells and the formation of multi-strength dioxin cells.
It is the lowest, the lowest, the lowest, the lowest, the lowest.
DHA causes the appearance of symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARD) and a severe loss of oxygen in the body.
Example: The organization of the outsourcing of the elephant ghettos and pulmonary bechwalas in the interests of
Blood: spread of blood clotted in the blood vessels (DIC), white and red blood reaction.
Precautions to reduce the likelihood of illness include staying at home, rushing out of crowded areas, washing hands repeatedly with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, improving breathing and keeping health practices and rushing eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be restrained from the tissue when it is laid or swallowed, and if the tissue is not available, it suggests that the inside part of the tissue be used.
After swallowing or swallowing, proper health preservation for the hand is encouraged.
The CDC proposed the use of clothes to curb the crowd, so as to limit the spread of the virus from people who do not show symptoms.Social distancing strategies aim to close schools and offices, impose travel restrictions and eliminate large public communities by reducing contact with large groups of affected people.
Distance travel guidelines also include staying at least 6 feet (1,8 meters) away from people.
Since the vaccine is not expected before 2021, a key point of comparing COVID-19 is to reduce the highest level of infection called “filter.”
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after having washed their hands or when their hands are apparently dirty, before eating and after washing their nose, lining or cutting.
It further suggests that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers be used, but only when soap and water are not easily available in areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not easily available, WHO forms two formulas for local production.
In these compounds, anti-microbial activity is produced from ethanol and isopropenol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help eradicate bacterial seeds; it is “not an active substance for beneficial germs in the hands.”
Glycerin is thrown as a liquid.
People have been organized with supportive surveillance, which includes intestinal therapy, oxygen support, and other important structural support.
The CDC has suggested that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Non-respiratory oxygen (ECMO) has been used for the solution of obstructive muscle oil in breathing, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal preservation is recommended to improve health and a healthy lifestyle and better nutrition strength support.
Supporting treatment is used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of COVID. The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people admitted to hospitals with COVID-19.
Experts and doctors in the U.S. have organized medical advice from various agencies in a free resource, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts recommended paracetamol (metaminofen) as a major drug instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus infestation, especially in medical settings when there is a medical procedure resulting from a process such as injection by a tube or hand airing.
For medical professionals caring for people affected by COVID-19, the CDC also recommends that the person be kept in an Airborne Infection Room (AIIR) in addition to general precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne infections.
Recommended devices are: PPE wall, breathing device or face mask, eye protector, and medical hands.
The N95 breathing device has been approved for industrial environments but the FDA has only allowed the mask to be used under emergency use permission (EUA).
They are designed to protect against dust such as particles generated in the air but do not guarantee the effects of their use against any particular unauthorized biological agent.
When the mask is not available, CDC suggests using a face cover or home-made mask as the last remedy.
People affected by COVID-19 are often not so ill that they need machining or switching, but some percent of patients need it.
COVID-19-related respiratory failure has been actively studied on the type of respiratory co-operation in persons admitted to hospitals, with some evidence that injection can be avoided with high-flow nasal tubes or double-positive respiratory dysfunction.
They do not know that both of them are beneficial to the sick.
Some doctors prefer stroke when available because this method limits the spread of pneumonia particles compared to a high-flow nose canal. severe illness is more common in older adults (including those over 60 and especially those over 80).
In developing countries there is no per bed vacuum supply, which limits the capacity to handle the increase in COVID-19-affected people in the health system who need to be admitted to hospitals.
One study found that in China, 5% were inserted into extreme surveillance units, 2.3% needed machine ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of people affected by COVID-19 are finally placed in extreme surveillance units.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as COVID-19 increases severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Pressure-controlling modes and high-powered PPE-capable fans need to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of damage and air collapse to the flames related to the ventilators.
There will be no more PEPs available on old ventilators.
Research for a possible treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in the medical experimental phase.
Remedy seems to be the most hopeful.
Although it may take time until 2021, many of the drugs that are being tested have already been approved for other uses or are already in the experimental phase.
In people with severe illnesses, antiviral medications can be tested.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in potential therapeutic effects and safety experiments.The FDA has allowed the plasma of artificially cured individuals to be used experimentally when a person’s life is seriously or immediately at risk.
It did not pass medical studies that proved safe and effective for the disease itself.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to stop the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his name and identification number.
It can identify the “nearest contact” by using app surveillance numbers and thus inform the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If a potential danger is detected, the app not only suggests self-cancer, but also warns local medical experts.The app uses mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and big data analysis on artificial intelligence to identify affected people and those who contact them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track cell phone data of those who are supposed to be coronavirus.
This measure was taken to safeguard the Khartoum and protect those who can contact the affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, the Deutsche Telekom split the data collected from mobile phone spaces with the German federal government agency, the Robert Coach Institute, to research and encourage the spread of the virus.
Russia has developed face-recognition technology to identify those who broke the canal.
The Italian regional health regulator has said that they have been informed by mobile phone operators that “40% of people are moving around.”
The German government held a 48-hour hecaton at the end of the week with 42,000 candidates.
The President of Estonia, Christine Kogolide, also called for a creative solution against the spread of the coronavirus at the international level.
Individuals may have problems due to heartburn, travel bans, adverse effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
BBC quoted Rourie O’Connor as saying, “Growing social distance, isolation, health disorders, mental pressure and economic disorder are complete disruptions to people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can occur mildly with or without any symptoms, which are similar to other common respiratory diseases such as common cough.
Generally, patients are healed within two weeks, while patients with severe or severe illnesses are healed within three to six weeks.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may also be at high risk of COVID-19, but COVID-19 data is not available in some people, COVID-19 affects the viruses that cause sampling.
In severely affected people, COVID-19 can turn into rapidly acute respiratory illness (ARD) that can cause failure to breathe, tenderness of the body or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body clotting, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal blood clusters, COVID-19 patients, experienced an increased period of blood cell aging in 6% of patients, while kidney failure to function normally was observed in 4% of patients in this group.
COVID-19-related hepatic transaminases occurred in approximately 20-30% of people.
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days passed in the hospital.
Of course, the average time for patients transferred to the extreme monitoring unit to enter the hospital and die was seven days.
In a study of initial patients, the median period from the onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full sequence was six to 41 days.
In a study by China’s National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% while among women was 1.7%
After the death of the frogs from the medical examination of the frogs for the presence of air in the frogs in small oils was seen widespread damage with domestic fibromycosides.
Changes related to the disease of the living virus cells have been observed in the neumocysts.
The image of mushrooms is similar to the symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARD).
According to China’s National Health Commission, 11.8 percent of deaths were caused by troponin or elevated heart levels.
According to U.S. March statistics, 89% of hospitalized patients had already had illnesses, and the region’s access to medical resources and social economy could have an impact on death rates.
Estimates of death rates vary due to regional changes, but this can also be due to problems in the process.
The reduced number of patients can cause deaths.
Indeed, this is the fact that these deaths are the result of those illnesses that have already suffered from it, meaning that the current rate of deaths is estimated to be low.
Tobacco smokers were 1.4 times more prone to severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more prone to extreme surveillance or death rates than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital administration saw a 20% to 30% decrease in fungal capacity in some people with the disease, and fungal examiners indicated limb damage.
This can cause the appearance of extreme signs after treatment.
Until March 2020, it was not known that it would support long-lasting strength in patients with past ectopic illnesses.
Other coronavirus behavior-based strength supports are seen as possible, but cases have also been listed where positive coronavirus outcomes will reappear after treatment from COVID-19.
These cases are thought to be worse due to multiple long-lasting illnesses instead of multiple illnesses.
This virus is thought to be natural and originated as a variety of diseases from animals.
Its original source is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the disease was almost entirely responsible for human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 certified events of COVID-19, published in Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first event of symptoms appeared on December 1, 2019.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced the first date of the onset of the disease on December 8, 2019.
Different measures are taken to determine deaths.
These numbers change over time and over time and affect the number of tests carried out, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time from the onset of the spread of the virus to the present and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health factors.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths from laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 viruses and medical or viral deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-certified SARS-CoV-2 viruses to U07.2.
Based on data from John Hopkins University, the proportion of global deaths and events by April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include Death Rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage rate of death in certified individuals, and Web Death Rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage rate of death in affected individuals (certified and uncertified).
These figures do not cover a specific population from a particular time and from the disease to the solution of the leprosy case.
Although antibodies are not shown in all affected individuals, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are affected.
In Italy, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants in the center of Wamba, Castiglioni di Cadà, of which 80 (1.7%) people have already died.
In Ganglotta, the disease has spread to younger people due to Catholic Christian celebrations, causing relatively low death rates, and it is not necessary that all deaths have not been classified in this way by COVID-19.
Moreover, the German health system was not defeated.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of patients can have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 (0,004 percent of the population) have confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The effects and rates of death are different among men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown that the death rate among men is higher.
Men are most at risk after the age of 50, while the difference between men and women ends at only 90.
In China, the death rate among men was 2.8 percent and among women 1.7 percent.
The real cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a cause.
Gender-based immunological changes, reduced tobacco use in women and men, and the generation of other diseases in men compared to women, such as high body pressure at a young age, can lead to increased rates of death in men.
In Europe, 57% of those affected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government would not detect the sex-related number of COVID-19 viruses.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in a more contagious way.
The highest percentage of medical staff, especially nursing women, are at higher risk of being affected by the virus.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the disease was officially named COVID-19.
WHO President T. Edom Graves described the CO from corona, VI from virus, disease from D, and 19 from the day when the first event occurred: 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations for the prevention of coronavirus.
Additionally, the WHO uses “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus responsible” in public literature.
Both disease and coronavirus are commonly referred to as coronavirus.
During the initial infestation of the virus in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as “coronavirus” and “Wuhan virus”.
In January 2020, WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as native names for viruses and diseases, in accordance with 2015 guidelines against the use of location names in the name of disease and virus.
On February 11, 2020, COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were officially released.
Due to the capacity limits of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are chewing out medical devices such as injection rows and ventilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the seller did not provide at the right time, a local worker prepared the transfer to make the desired 100 valves overnight.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, complicated ideas, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset, prevention, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease have spread over the Internet.
Humans can spread viruses to other animals.
This study failed to find evidence of viral manifestations in seals, cockroaches and chickens.
There is no medication or vaccine for the treatment of the disease.
Official organizations, educational groups and industry practitioners continue to conduct research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched a “progressive experiment” to review the effects of treatment from the four most useful existing antiviral compounds.
No vaccines are available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccines candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same source to enter ACE2 in human cells.
Three wisdom practices are being investigated.
First, the goal of the researchers is to prepare for the entire virus.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, develops immediate defenses in the human body against the new disease of COVID-19.
Another strategy, a sub-part of Wixon, aims to develop a Wixon that creates sensitivity to some of the sub-components of the virus in the defensive system.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the center of such research is the spike protein, which helps the virus enter the enzymatic intervention of ACE2.
The third strategy is the nucleus-accelerating vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, the nucleus method of producing vaccine).
These strategies will be tested for the protection and usefulness of the experimental vaccine developed – the first medical trial of the vaccine will start on four volunteers in Seattle on March 16, 2020.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code transmitted from the virus that infects the disease.The preparation of the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 has suggested a potential challenge for antibody-dependent adults, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active medical experiments will be conducted by April 2020.
Seven experiments are testing the drug, which is already an approved treatment for malaria, including four studies of haadronoxic chloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research consists of a re-recommended antiviral drug, and by the end of April several countries will report new phase III trials on remediation.
By April 2020, COVID-19 vaccine preparation and dynamic review for candidates for its use has been launched.A number of existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being tested, including Remediciver, Chlorocane and Hydroxy Chlorocane, Lupenovir/Retnovir and Lupenovir/Retnovir combined with interferon beta.
By the end of March 2020, there are temporary evidence of utility from Remedios.
Medical improvement has been observed in patients treated with reduced use of Remedium.
Phase III medical trials are ongoing in the U.S., China and Italy.Chlorocine, which was first used to treat malaria, was studied on it in February 2020 with initial results.
Of course, in research, we are raising calls for review.
The medical authorities of Korea and China have recommended the use of chlorokin.
Of course, the Wuhan Institute for Virology, although it recommends one gram of daily dosage, only reminds that doubling the dose of the drug can ultimately be dangerous and dangerous.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency license for those doctors who are involved in treating patients with COVID-19 to use their licensed perohydrochloropharm and chlorocyne.China's 7th Edition Guidelines include interferon, ribavirin or omiphene in drugs used against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that higher amounts of rubavirin are necessary to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the organism.
Nitroxandrolone has been recommended for further vevo studies after reduced erectile dysfunction in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that initial nodular priming by transmembrane protein serene 2 (TMPRSS2) is necessary for intrusion into SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Chlorocane and hydroxy-chlorocane have major barriers in the study with or without azithromycin, which prevented the medical class from accepting this treatment without further study.
In the post-COVID-19 phases, the cytokine stream can be complicated.
There is evidence that hydroxyclourocine contains the anti-citogenic strain properties.After completing a brief study, the National Health Commission of China included tosilozomab in the treatment guidelines.
After positive results were shown in people with severe illness, Italy is passing a stage 2 random test at national level.
The common serum ferritin blood test to identify the cochlear bloodstream, aims to counteract such advancements, which are thought to cause death in some affected individuals.
Steroid refractory cytokine released in 2017 for the treatment of disease that causes a different cause, i.e. milestone from CART cell therapy, on the FDA approved the anticancer 6 receptor rival based on past style-based studies
To date, there is no random, overwhelming evidence that toxicomab is an effective treatment against CRS.
The clean and concentrated antibody developed by the defence system of people recovering from COVID-19 is being researched as an inactive protective factor for an inactive vaccine to transfer to those who need it.
This logic was tested with unfinished results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is a predictable method by which inactive antibody therapy can cause defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Certainly, other methods, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fagocytosis, may be possible.
Other cases of inactive antibody therapy, such as the use of an assisted monoclonal antibody, work.
The production of antioxidant substances, which are the liquid part of the blood of patients and contain specific antibodies to this virus, can be prepared for immediate use.
Coronavirus Diseases, Nearly Related Syndrome Group
A doctor at Wuhan’s central hospital, Lee Van Lang, was struck and died of COVID-19 after awakening from the virus’s spread.
