Parliament did not support the amendment to the
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a proposal to abolish the section of the Criminal Code under which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would have opened the way for the release of the jailed former prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at second reading on a proposal to ease penalties for economic offences.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for allegedly entering into an unfavorable contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the convict's appeal is due in December.
Tymoshenko calls the verdict a political revenge of the regime, and the trial has sparked suspicions of bias in the West.
The proposal to remove Article 365 of the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs.
It took 226 votes to pass.
Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, which has its defeats.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert, and without him, the war is over.
It's just a matter of defining the winner.
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists will win the election, but the question is whether moderation or radicalism.
The Transitional National Council has subscribed to customary Sharia law, and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because you cut off your hand for stealing.
Women can forget about emancipation, potential apostates can be executed, and so on.
Instead of the dictator's person, a society of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be order in Libya that we cannot imagine and certainly do not want.
But our way of life is neither the only one nor objectively the best, and it probably would not be suitable for change, for example, for the Libyans just mentioned.
In fact, it's odd that Islamic fighters have taken the fall from infidel dogs.
The only excuse they have is that, from their point of view, the NATO airstrikes were not directed by some American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every intervention.
So when you're looking for winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We've been in gunfights, we've served Islam, and our politicians have been rid of their political ally in the form of a dictator without any guaranteed profit.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we're not occupying Libya militarily.
That eliminates the problem of the locals chasing the crusaders.
But without the oil companies, will they have the black gold of Libya as a bargaining chip?
Perhaps not, and the West will finally be able to boast of its selfless protection of human rights.
Unless those sharia law-abiding people get in the way.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have become the focus of investors
The statistical downpour swept across Europe on Tuesday.
The individual countries published their GDP data for the 3Q.
The Czech economy stagnated quarter-on-quarter, Germany and France are growing.
But the bond market is breaking records today.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries have published preliminary forecasts for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted the data for the second quarter, in which Germany was in the next better than expected position (up by 0,3% from the original 0,1%), while France reported a slight decrease of 0,1% (the original data indicated stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated, confirming the trend of a gradual slowdown in the growth of economic performance, according to the CSU.
The results are worse than the analysts' estimates.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
The German economy grew by 0,5% in the third quarter, according to preliminary and seasonal data.
The euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September, in line with analysts' expectations, compared with the previous quarter.
The Greek economy contracted by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on her 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical levels.
The problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields on Czech 10-year bonds remain below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, there are voices that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs have qualified for the EURO.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate the 200 million mark.
The football team has done the hardest thing of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Jiráček, she won 1:0.
Czech football, with a great deal of luck in the second half, defended a luxurious lead from home revenge and will not be missing again at the European championship.
IHNED.cz has been following the match in detail.
Hardly any excitement in the first half and a big dose of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home defeat in the final, great Czech and hero Jiraček won in Montenegro happily 1: 0 and celebrates the progress to the European championship.
The Montenegrin team was under pressure in the second half due to the precise defense of the Czech team.
The losers of the match were Damjanovic and Vučinić, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Peter Čech, the Czech national team will not be missing the European Championship next year, and the prize money of about 200 million crowns will be added to the national football fund.
There was a lot of fighting football from the first few minutes.
Both teams were hard to get into the mix and played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of the home players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense precisely repelled the long kicks for the defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a live shield.
Several hundred college students have built a live shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
They're using their gesture to show their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed outside the facility at noon Tuesday and then chanted the death of the United States and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Isfahan, Iran, set up a live shield around the Isfahan nuclear technology center, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They're showing they're prepared to defend their country's nuclear program with their lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently concluded that Iran does not appear to have given up its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.
There's talk in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then chanted death to America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran's nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press reports that in addition to the Isfahan facility, the Natanz uranium enrichment facility would also be targeted.
Diet of an obese child: no breakfast and no dinner
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent being obese.
Obese children, however, tend to come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, as a recent survey showed.
Once again, the importance of the environment and patterns surrounding one's growth for healthy human development is being demonstrated.
For example, obese children have up to half the incidence of bedbugs on the tables of normal-weight families.
It's no coincidence that fries were eaten at dinner the day before a research-related awareness campaign called Obesity, more than 19 percent of obese people.
And in families of obese children, sports are not the norm, as is the case in most families of schoolchildren today - only 15 percent of the children said that their parents would take time to exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year of the Obesity Is Not a Chance campaign, sponsored by the General Health Insurance Corporation and Unilever.
So far, more than 12 000 pupils from 4th to 8th grade have been involved in the project.
Proper diet and exercise in the family are among the factors that are causing the dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children.
"For example, only half of those surveyed reported eating five times a day in the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner mode, which is one of the basic requirements of proper nutrition", says one survey.
No breakfast and no dinner
Experts point out that relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are also essential for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of schoolchildren's families have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst was finding that one in ten households didn't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that unhealthy fries are much more common in families with obese children.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweetened soda every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly exercise, less than half - 15 percent - of their parents did.
Make your own menu
The next part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own menus according to their own tastes and opinions from the options offered.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition".
Their favorite foods include many meaty, meaty, and sweet dishes.
"The popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming", says the final report of the survey.
Pasta was the main meal, just above the chicken.
But the children were virtually unwilling to eat any peas, and fish and vegetable lunches are not popular.
Health Benefits
The survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if given the right information.
"It is not by chance that the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the Obesity awareness lecture had a significant shift in preference towards healthy eating principles in a number of cases", the project results state.
This was particularly noticeable in the case of sweetened sodas, where more children began to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to check the questionnaire for poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and to limit sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the opening article on how stylists learn, I complained so much that there was already a lot of that in the opening lesson.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Three lectures from industry experts, dressing up problem figures, and a seminar on how to do things on the court.
It's going to get worse.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even though the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it's really "trampled on".
This time, the principal, Alenka, and I were discussing (there is no boy in the class) how to dress a woman who is not in perfect proportion.
And that's the vast majority of them.
Some have short necks, some have a boyish figure with no curves, and some are overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically smooth the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how to make a woman like Jennifer Lopez, with bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, look good and not dress too provocatively.
For example, if the gap between the waist and the hips is such that the skirt or pants don't really fit, it's worth having at least one of those pieces made to measure.
You won't regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are priceless.
You'll feel much better in a custom skirt than one that keeps moving, twisting, pulling back in your waist and so on.
The boy character can afford to wear clothes with embroidery, makeup, or embroidery.
There's a lot of information and characters out there, of course, so I'm glad I have all week to sort through all the information in my head.
And I'm afraid, with all the homework I've been given, it's just too much.
Each student was assigned a celebrity to design two outfits: a daytime outfit and an evening outfit.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the personality, and the type of character.
I'm going to be dressing up Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaigns.
I'm a lot better in spirit, for me personally, than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who has gained maybe 100 pounds recently (please take the hyperbole into account), or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut the clothes out of magazines or search the Internet and print them out and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
It's important to think about the graphic side of the design.
A stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific tasks, such as trends in handbags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture, loaded with information on character types, was immediately spread by three industry guests.
The stylist is Honza Pokorny, the fashion designer is Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer is Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a good stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key here.
For example, a trenchcoat (or if you want to call it a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a shirt as a cape, but you can also wear it on your bare body, bootstraps, and as a dress.
Or you just pull the sleeves or the collars and the whole look is different.
"Play with it", he insisted.
But what I appreciated most was the following advice: "To work, you need to know the rules perfectly".
"Then you can start breaking them", said Jacob.
So I finally understand why we're all so overwhelmed with all these lessons about what to combine with what, what to do with, why, when even in fashion magazines we often see something else.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to Ben's photographer, I know that a stylist has to have a lot more options than there are to photograph.
So for a fashion story that's going to be 10 pages, I have to be ready to "fit" at least 15.
And also that the clothes in the photo look and function differently when combined with other pieces of leckda than they actually are.
So we have to think about that when we're designing outfits.
That image and style make up half of success, Honza the Humble confirmed.
You just have to look at Madonna, who's not exactly a miracle singer, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (I'm good at something, my looks are secondary).
And if someone is going to let us create a styling, then we should expect that they will very likely dictate a completely different size than they actually have.
Then all you have to do is google and see if the tabloids have written about the celebrity getting fat or losing weight or whatever.
Honza and Mario told us on Sunday that it's not enough for a stylist to know how to dress and how to dress.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he wears, so it's important to be a good psychologist, too.
To judge people, not to be judged, to stand by your own opinion.
"If some manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw her the whole closet out and say, 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.'"
"Find at least a few things you can recommend and wear", says Mario.
He also showed us in detail what a so-called "placebo", or bag, must contain.
It's the one you put around your waist and you have all the properties.
In addition to the obvious things like scissors, hair rollers, or closing pins, there are also silk thread (used by the stylist to help photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips to be used to sew the back of clothing if it is larger (a pin or other clasp is not allowed, it would damage the garment), or stitches.
To not only listen but also to experience something, we learned how to properly glue our shoes.
Even in a studio with a flat surface, the base could be damaged, let alone outdoors.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch the shoes with scissors, so they don't get damaged.
So it takes real skill.
Mario was delighted when he complimented my work without reservation.
That skill is not really my friend.
This is just a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
I'm starting to realize that styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the park, no matter who says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run, they race across America.
The reviews
A careless ride turns into a routine morning shift because of a series of unnecessary lazy mistakes.
The ambition has been largely fulfilled, but it is not valid if nobody is clearly willing to do anything extra.
The new installment, subtitled The Run, was highly anticipated upon release.
He promised to take this year's Need for Speed series in a new direction, and from the playable visuals, it seemed like a game that might not be limited to the action racing genre.
We were also curious about the inserted passages where the main character gets out of the car and runs off.
But as is the custom with the NFS series, many things turn out a little differently than we expected.
They're potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing is dragging down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for at least a few years now.
So they're not really bugs, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story in which the protagonist Jack has certain personal problems and the solution is offered by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get behind the wheel of a car on the West Coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get to New York City first.
The idea has several interesting elements.
The course is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
This means that each race is run on a different track and the stages are set in different, quite different and interesting environments.
You don't get the feeling for a second that the game is always the same.
Some of the environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to previous parts of the series.
So it's not a worldly thing.
But riding through the desert, through the autumn landscape, or high in the snow-capped mountains is visually very pleasant.
And the races are occasionally marred by some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you'll wind up in a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to get hit by an avalanche.
Besides, the individual races are quite well-arranged.
There's only a few types, but that's enough.
For a moment, you are trying to overtake the required number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you catch up (a classic foot fight), and then you are faced with a duel with a single opponent.
The police will also intervene from time to time, further undermining your efforts.
The new thing is the off-road passages.
It's more like an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
Nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, though, there are far fewer of these passages in play than you might expect (perhaps even just three in particular).
But in the end, it's a good thing, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying, and in the context of the above, it's one of the elements that diversifies the game.
The ride model follows in the footsteps of the previous installments.
That means it's definitely not a big deal nowadays, but it's not a negative.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
But for the more action-packed racing, the car still fits the bill, although we could have found a better one.
So far, everything is perfectly fine.
But problems start to appear after a while.
Unlike the road model, the crash model is not very good.
We don't expect this type of game to count complex deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how your car will behave before you hit any object, then you're probably not doing it all right.
Typically, in a close-up or in passing cars in normal traffic, you will sometimes only lick each other slightly, but other times in an almost identical situation your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even to attack directly.
The restart system doesn't make it any more difficult, but it'll keep you in a good place.
The restarts are designed so that if you break down or go far off track, the game throws you back to the last rest stop on the track.
But there are only five restarts available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race all over again.
So it's more of a fallback aid than a reliable one.
Sometimes even a restart won't help, it'll solve them by having to learn a certain section of the race by heart.
The great disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns require a specific route, or you simply cannot get into them.
Other times, you will encounter "civilian" vehicles in the same configuration at a given location, whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see the two opposing cars passing in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in a position where you have to overtake or brake.
It doesn't matter when you get to them, because it's "calculated" so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
The opponents have another advantage.
You'll come across several places throughout the game where, again, regardless of the time, you'll always be overtaken by the same opponent at the same place.
It's the most striking at the end of the game on the long bridge, where you're going in opposite directions.
The adversary must get there before you at any cost.
If it's in front of you, it's going to make your view of the other cars worse, so you're going to be a little bit of a mess at first.
The intention is understandable to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-fueled, but the execution is so obvious that it will surely disgust you quickly.
And that's a shame, because even with a simple ride model, it's fun and so action-packed that sometimes you can't quite see where it's going.
And it doesn't really matter whether it's a concept with 50 unique tracks, or a race schedule where boredom doesn't have a chance, or whatever.
The unconventional idea is to switch cars during races.
You have to be careful of the gas stations on the roadside, because that's where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you'll be satisfied with what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American bullfighters for straight highways, and exotic super sports for technical riding, such as on winding mountain roads.
And along with the main story mode, there's also the challenge mode, which is racing in the locations you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but experience points for your profile, which is shared by challenges and stories.
To get a higher level of driver, different subjects are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for profile.
It is also linked to the online Autolog feature, which among other things compares your scores with other players and provides additional community features.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
Your car will take you into the subway tunnel (buzz) where you will ride the tracks in the dark (buzz).
The speedometer flashes the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (buzz) and the meter sets in from behind and uncompromisingly knocks you down.
So we're gonna have a debate in the editorial board for the next few days about whether or not anyone really thought about the game or whether the writers really think we're such a big jerk.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes, so at some of the most intense moments, the image drops, and in some cases, quite tragically.
But this is especially true in crashes with a large number of participants, where continuous imaging would no longer be of any use to you.
The soundtrack is fine, and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a wider audience, the soundtrack was created from the "every dog's a different story" category, but it can be assumed that listening to the music will not necessarily make anyone buy the game.
The overall feel of Need for Speed: The Run is so much more disconcerting.
If the game were to avoid making any unnecessary mistakes, then we wouldn't be afraid to say that The Run is the best NFS game in years.
That's how the game works.
The fun is sure to be great, but be prepared for mistakes to be smashed in your eyes by the force of airport headlights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicen:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
'The Treaty of Lisbon has seriously disturbed the balance between the various institutions.'
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war".
"It will take five or six years for the situation to settle down a bit, to calm down and for all the players to get used to their new roles", Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She showed how serious she is about her motto 'Comprehensible and open about Europe' in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the various EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many of the UK Law School lecturers might envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was inconspicuous, that he was a gray-haired official, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that it took everyone by surprise that he was doing a great job".
'He is a man who can listen to 27 Member States, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go.'
She explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?" as a significant step towards unification and greater visibility of EU policies towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from the cheesecake.
Vicen also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency called the previous meeting a success.
The Czechs were tackling the impending financial crisis, solving the gas crisis or organizing the Eastern Partnership summit.
The fall of the government at this time was a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is very busy at the moment.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact" was not only the presidency but also the ensuing financial crisis, which continues to this day.
In addition, the new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is particularly complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be lean and frugal, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogan for her visit to Brussels: 'Europe is understandable'.
"I really don't like ugly acronyms, foreign words, nonsense that no one understands.
How can the citizen understand that Brussels is not really making curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that we really have to be banned from cheesecake".
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is upon us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
She believes that many factors are to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also the low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, she highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak comes, the Frenchman next to me says, "Hey, what are you doing there, your Visegrad Four?" and he doesn't look too excited about it".
The future of the Union, according to Vicen, will be marked by new hard rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
It sees the concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation" as very real.
"We have the euro area countries and the countries outside the euro area".
"We have the Schengen area, we already have the institute for enhanced cooperation".
"First, it was said, only countries that want to cooperate, and those that don't, stay out of it".
"There will be more of these institutions and it will be a strong two-speed Europe", she expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the Union as a whole should be negotiated between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM's innovator begins its second century
If you were looking for a word that best describes IBM's strategy, the closest word would be "long-term".
IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution to the general public, a company that is seen as very modern, and yet it has been a hundred years since its founding.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by the company's first CEO, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world's problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold (and also the name of the internal magazine that began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson's carefully constructed corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, thinking long term means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values, while not being afraid to change everything else around it.
It has allowed us to transform technology, business and society in our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the next 100 years", noted Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Refined system
Watson in the 1930s approached his employees in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in the Czech Republic - IBM people were among the first American employees to have paid leave, employer insurance plus elegant work uniforms and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM has a long-term relationship with its customers that is just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in the early days in the development of talent - as one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, so that they could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is to replace Palmisan as IBM's CEO next year with a woman, Virginia Rometty.
She's been at IBM for 30 years, still holding the position of head of sales, marketing and strategy.
IBM has been doing what's called a pit in recent years, an online brainstorming, which has resulted in many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder there's a lot of ideas -- almost half a million people work at the company.
Institutions with a good reputation
The firm's strong internal and external image ensures its position in the business.
"From the beginning, IBM has had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company", Harvard Business School professor and IBM author Rosabeth Moss Kanter told The Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using technology", added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company says, there's a difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM, or "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States for its logo, has grown into one of the world's largest companies in a century.
It is probably the most versatile technology company, developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won Nobel Prizes.
Her inventions include the ATM, the credit card, the cash swap, the barcode, and the floppy disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest tech company by market capitalization this year (first behind Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations were to the taste of customers and the times - IBM did not, for example, bet on its own OS/2, Prodigy online service or IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is built to move forward, you cannot be emotionally tied to the past", notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building their infrastructure on multiple platforms -- and if they don't work, they abandon it.
Unlike competing Microsoft, which is basically running on Windows.
The future technology
Services account for the largest share of IBM's revenue, with software and hardware accounting for about one fifth.
And yet, back in 1990, it was the strongest hardware player, with more than half of the market.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, and during that time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis first hit the world.
IBM is following the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to be going through the current crisis unscathed.
IBM's stock price has skyrocketed 120 percent since the beginning of 2008, and the company's net profit is continuously growing.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but its values.
So it's to be expected that even if another crisis comes, this resilient giant will handle it.
The history of IBM: From cheese-cutting to space flight
IBM, the International Business Machines, was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally under the shorthand name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 - originally it was a brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for later IBM was the merger of four companies, with a history dating back to the 1880s.
They had technologies like the famous "pushers", or clocks that recorded the arrivals and departures of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who also served as chairman of the company's board of directors until 1930.
Flint hired the head of a rival firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the IBM founder - Watson's ideas are still built on an unbeatable corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started out manufacturing and selling all kinds of machines for businesses -- from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During Watson's first four years at the helm, the company doubled its sales to $9 million and began a massive expansion into every continent.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost 40 years in the chair, he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began work on artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, humans and computers from IBM helped NASA navigate the flight to space -- to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous manned flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "coin", which set the computer standard of the day, called the IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to Lenovo, a Chinese company, and instead bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to devote itself fully to consulting and high value-added services.
A strategy that's been paying off for the last three years at IBM -- it's called the Smarter Planet concept.
It aims to make smart use of technologies in areas that are not yet planned, for example in transport and urban management.
For the business sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which helps merchants manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the domestic market.
It established its branch in what was then Czechoslovakia as early as 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM, the Czech Republic also operates a strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and also has a world-class voice recognition research team.
The knight's wife, the unfaithful husband.
Ivette, keep the donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Knight (53) has said the end!
After her husband Josef Rychtar (53) became not only Iveta Bartošová's protector (45), but also her lover, Darina still hoped that Josef would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she's not going to wait any longer and she's set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", explained the Knight.
When Darina Richter gave Bartoš a home in her summer, she probably had no idea how her marriage would end.
Although Iveta moved out of Riverton after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, accepted her husband's relationship, and even said goodbye to him forever.
A knight doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If the Knight and Bartocha had broken up, he wouldn't be waiting for his wife at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons, and if he wants to live out his life in our house together, no one will turn him away".
"But she will live it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties", revealed the Queen, saying that she had already separated from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind that Darina closed the back door.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Ivette and I'm not going to change that".
"My wife arranged a paper marriage and I respect that".
"The company's moving on, I'm doing the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I'm buying".
"Darina and I are talking normally, except we don't share beds", said the Lightning Knight.
If the Knight had found a new love, he wouldn't have stopped her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she goes with, or if she has any friends.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
Worst Habits of Women: Are They Affecting You?
If you ask men if they can name any typical female vices, they're usually all very quick to drop them off the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, which list several female vices that can perfectly pump blood through the veins of men?
Purchasing
Does your other half blame you for being a shopping addict?
Do you have to buy at least one robe a week?
Do you like to shop in bulk at a discount?
Then in your case, shopping can be described as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their shopping spree.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around the clothing store, looking for a good fit, and then trying them all out (ideally in different color variations) in the booth?
While shopping is a hobby for most women, it can be a living hell for men.
Just think how many times you've told your man to wait for you outside the door...
Constant Discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you even like me?"
Do these phrases ring a bell?
- You did, didn't you?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with their looks.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are just allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their looks.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequent the complaint, the more annoying the women are.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an endless roller coaster.
She washes windows, vacuums, wipes floors, wipes dust, rubs the bathtub - at least twice a week.
You blame your partner for stepping on a clean floor with a dirty foot, the kids for dirtying a scratched sink and patting the stained-glass living room wall you went to all that trouble to polish?
If you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should certainly not come first in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships and your family well-being.
The roasting
"Throw your used sweaters in the trash".
"Are you gonna wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towel doesn't belong on the ground".
If you rub your partner like this several times a day, you can sure spin him.
Of course, you don't mean anything by it, you want to make things right.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to go through all that stuff with them.
Slander, gossip, and other things.
For some women, it is also the habit of slandering, gossiping, but also of insulting and conspiring against someone.
Women are relationship-oriented, so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how, and why.
Hopefully, each of us will be able to spread a little harmless gossip or slander here and there.
Hand on heart, it's the way of all women.
On the other hand, the gossips of the coolest grain, who like to gossip and often do, are perhaps despised by everyone and are particularly dangerous to their surroundings - especially within the female work collective.
Jagger and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with assists
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr contributed two assists in Monday's NHL game to Philadelphia's 5-3 win on Carolina's ice and is once again leading the Czech players' productivity in the competition.
The 39-year-old star's performance was rewarded in both cases by Claude Giroux, who added another over and was named the best player of the match.
Two assists in the match were recorded by Jagr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jagger told overseas reporters after the game that he was predicting a big night for the Giroux.
"I told him before the game he'd get a hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you get that feeling", explained Jagr, after Giroux scored the Flyers' first goal.
A little later, the second strike had a Czech trail.
Voráček fought the Hurricanes' goal and presented it to the scoring man, Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first half, the Flyers were down by home run Patrick Dwyer, but the Flyers were back in the second half.
Specifically Giroux.
After working with Jagr, he scored the third goal, then his shot was passed to Wayne Simmonds' fourth goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said of his center.
"I never thought I'd end up playing hockey with a guy like him".
"I'm happy about that".
"I want to play him".
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's all turning around", Jagr added.
Carolina made a drama of the game, with a goal from Tuom Ruut and again from Dwyer, who had a penalty shot, and he scored a goal.
But no further complications were allowed by Matt Read, who finished the two-on-one conversion.
"Excellently hit our Pronger belt".
"He pulled the trigger, I picked up speed, and (Read) drove to the farthest pole".
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out", described the last goal of the match from his perspective.
Philadelphia has won the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play the game against Buffalo, in the second quarter he retired due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, along with the experienced defender, lost the double-header and lost on penalties to the Spurs, 2 to 3.
One of their raids didn't turn Tomasz Plekanec.
The home coach was more concerned with the back-row's vast squad than with the points lost, with the game being played by only five defenders.
"This is bad".
"We only finished the fight with one experienced player, the rest were young men".
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it", said Jacques Martin.
"It came down on us one by one, and we couldn't resist".
"We should have simplified the game, moved the puck out of our zone".
We had gaps in that", added one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 shots to Winnipeg's 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals, which ended a five-game losing streak, were shared by five different shooters.
How fares have developed since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned travel agencies were allowed in what was then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were selling overwhelmingly only trips to the countries of the Socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on a seaside holiday to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea by the Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
The clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia was subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely individually even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but you had to stay overnight with a sleeping bag or have "good acquaintances" at the travel agency.
But it wasn't won.
The so-called currency pledge, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) for the journey to the West.
By far the most common holiday destination was the Czech lands, which resulted in a large number of huts and cottages that the Czechs built for themselves, a practice that still persists today.
Travel by Czechs has thus experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
The enormous paradox, which we no longer realize today, is that it was not possible to travel freely to what is now the most popular country in the world, Croatia, until 1989 because it was part of what was then Yugoslavia.
The abolition of visas to neighbouring Western European countries in the late 1990s triggered a huge wave of short-term visits, particularly to Vienna, Austria, and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovaks could not afford to travel to the West, and everyone wanted to see it for a while.
In Paris, for example, the Czechs' camping trips to parks and tents were not worth the cost of a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech travel at this time was to bring their own food, canned food, salami, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech koruna, which allowed our tourists to buy Western currency freely after many decades.
But our standard of living and with it the average wage were rising, leading to another important moment around 1997.
The increased demand for travel has led to tour operators regularly offering charter flights since 1997, which have made flights incredibly cheaper than in the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating quantitative discounts.
By the late 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free access to virtually all the developed countries of the world except the United States, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to exotics was made from the Czech Republic, thanks to a significant demand, it was to Thailand.
From this year, direct charters to warm distant countries are flown every year with Czech tourists, this winter they will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The exotic country is now visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, symbolizing our post-revolutionary evolution, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US abolished visas for Czech tourists, and our country was definitely ranked among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czech Republic also spent more than half of its holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than CZK 15 000 per person on a single holiday abroad, including costs at the place of stay.
The General Assembly is to find the Chairman, again but there is a danger of a pat
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and there is a danger that Ivan Haškov's successor as head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general assembly, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement on the electoral procedure.
Without her, the vote won't even begin on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík are interested in running the Czech football.
Hasek resigned from his post in June and, in his departure, urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
But in the post-Hask era, football has slipped back into the fray between the two chambers of the federation, which can't agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16, when a new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly gathered in vain in the National House in Prague on Smíchov, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a matter of the method of election.
There was no agreement on who actually had the right to vote in the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or even officials with full powers.
On this one point, there has since been partial agreement, helped by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law that full representation is not possible.
But there are still disputes over the electoral process.
The situation has not been made clear enough by the Executive Committee, which no longer deals with anything else in its deliberations, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of the option has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is, how do we proceed in the third round to eliminate the possibility of a tie?
"The question is whether to follow the rules or find another model", said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Football Association, which represents professional football.
According to the rules of the proposed model, in the third round, the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Morava is reportedly willing to make concessions to win the candidate who gets the highest percentage of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Republic also imposes a condition that the winner must have a two-thirds majority in this percentage count.
"But that would make no sense of the two previous rounds, it would completely negate the two-chamber concept", he understands the objection of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best to vote according to the current statutes.
Tomáš Paclík agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral system determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all the candidates.
"I wish the vote to be held as strictly as possible".
"So that no nonsense like the last general assembly is invented", declared the owner of the property, Viktorie Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his remarks was mainly against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said the new chairman would be well known and he believed the candidates would work together constructively in the future.
"All the passions will be eased by the possible European Championship qualification of the national team today".
"Football will be on the upswing again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate", says the official from Jabloneck, who has the most experience of all three in managing football at both professional and regional level.
The Reich is more reserved.
"I hope there's a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided".
"Not among the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to adapt the regulations to their purpose".
"This may cause the general pile to block again".
"But I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some of the talks were supposed to take place in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generalship will be complete by the game.
The flight crew, which was to travel to Podgorica, among others, Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucher and Rajchl, did not fly from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and an alternative option was sought to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
Finally, there may be a crucial ministerial meeting, which may reportedly take place on Wednesday.
Education, Youth and Physical Education Minister Josef Dobes would like to bring the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general assembly of ČSTV, which will solve the new direction of Czech sports after the financial problems of Saška.
Paclick goes into the race for president because he can't see a suitable candidate.
If the head of the football players of Pilsen, Tomáš Paclík, had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary general assembly, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even registered for the fight for the top position.
"If there is a quality adept, I fight for him and I don't vote".
"But under the current situation, we have not been able to find anyone like that", Paclík told CTC.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jindřich Rajchl, Paclik is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite in the election, on his way to the head of the Czech Republic.
Paclík also stresses that if he wins, he would only remain in the role of chairman until 2013, when a proper general assembly is on the agenda.
He would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager in the position who is not too involved in football.
"I've spoken to some people who might be of use".
"It was crazy for me when some people said that they don't even want to identify with Czech football at this moment".
"That's the view I'd like to change", he said.
Paclik says that what bothers him most is Pelt's connection to the president of the Plzeň Regional Football Association, Roman Berber, a man with a controversial reputation who is known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general assembly.
It's so unacceptable to Pack that Pelta should be in the chairman's position.
"If he wins, it will preserve the status quo and nothing will move forward in football".
"Combined with the support of Berber, who is a capable businessman, it would not be even more beneficial to football", Paclik said.
He also mentions that Pelt's name was mentioned in the intercepts of the corruption investigation years ago, but Pelt got away with it.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's win would bring to football".
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Paclík, who also takes into account his previous statement that he would "sell the Plzeň club if Pelta became president".
But if Paclik wins Thursday's election, he could imagine a future partnership with Pelta.
He's also considering another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I'd go to".
"He has great powers".
"I could imagine him as the head of the representation".
"But he couldn't manage the association".
"I don't stick my nose where I don't know how", said Paclík, who attracted a lot of attention in September by standing behind the dismissal of the jury committee headed by Lucek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclik says he'd be brave to lead the association.
He has been in charge of Pilsen since last summer, which with his support celebrated its Premier League triumph in May.
"I have the power to make a change in the football environment, to contribute to its certain cultivation".
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which may tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which is done in unpleasant situations", said Paclik, who does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel Kretinsky.
He would also consider as a priority the strengthening of relations between the Czech Republic and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political elite to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things a new chairman should be doing".
"If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their argument, but they have to be straightforward about where the money is going", he noted.
As a burden now Paclík does not even take his connection with the Plzeň club, although he himself claims that the president of the FAČR should be "non-party".
Pelta is again connected to the Jablonski, the Reichchl to the Prague Dukla.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see the point in me hypocrisingly transferring my shares in a Plzeň club to someone and then returning to it in a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes for the FACR that would eliminate the electoral pat
Two days before the general assembly of the football association, one of the candidates for president, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would sit down so that the FAČR would have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral rules in the future.
The Jablonski official is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will significantly dampen the football team's eventual success today.
Pelta had already promised before the failed election in September that he would focus on representation and fundraising if elected.
He decided to go to the last minute before the last general election, so a two-month delay could be useful to him to defend and present his ideas about football management in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday".
"They feel it is high time that someone takes the lead", says a man who is primarily associated with the apple orchard club but who has served for many years in Sparta and on the association's executive committee.
That's why he thinks he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems with choice are due to the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the June general assembly, statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed".
"If they don't allow for different interpretations, we've had the chairman since September", Pelta pointed out.
He's just reworking the most important document of the civic association as a crane for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, I will take it as a personal mission and I am willing to take personal responsibility if I fail".
"It's a fundamental thing that we can't live without", says Pelta.
He's trying to keep his head down from his opponents.
He has previously indicated that he could imagine working with Henry Reichl, whom he recognises for his legal education, and knows full well that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He didn't attack Tomáš Paclik for long, who didn't leave Pelt's threads dry.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's had some success".
"His attacks, however, were unworthy and many people were taken by surprise in the way the campaign went".
"That is why many of them now doubt his true character", he told his opponents, who said Pelt remained true to the proclamation he made in September.
His most powerful weapon, he says, is his knowledge of football from the lowest leagues to the national team.
That's supposed to be the football showcase.
"And I would also try to end all affairs beginning with the Bohemians case or the echoes of last year's corruption scandal".
"I would immediately go into negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football", the 46-year-old candidate told CTC two months ago.
He also promised at the time that his arrival at the helm of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I must first get acquainted with the staff", he said of Strahov, where the long period of unrest has caused understandable nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios that accompany the upcoming general assembly, they believe that delegates will not travel to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If the only issue is how the third round is going to be, we can get through it".
"Football needs credibility, and it will only gain it by finally having its leader again", Pelta remains optimistic two days before what may be the decisive day of his career as a civil servant.
Rajchl promises that under him, the FACHR will start working hard
If the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic were elected at Thursday's general meeting, the previous vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl, many people in the association would not be pleased.
The Reich has promised to work hard if elected.
He wants to push for systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for the different football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hasek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football as a whole".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to national teams, professional football, performance football to youth".
"I'm not saying I'm going to do everything myself", Reichl said in an interview with CTC.
"I'm a team player, and I want to divide the executive committee's powers so that each member is dedicated to a specific area".
"And I'm going to give the tough assignments to make sure that football moves forward one mile in every segment".
"A lot of people wouldn't be happy about it, because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others", he added.
He's been thinking about not running again because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement.
"I'm known to work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw clubs at me and question my every move", he explained why he hesitated.
"But many people told me not to give up because then others would give up".
"It's a trust I can't just throw away", he said.
He's also motivated by continuing the work he started with Hash.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away".
"There are processes that are underway that will have a ripple effect in a few years, and I don't want anyone to stop them", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Peltya, is elected, the situation in the union could return to the pre-Hashik era.
"I believe in systematicity, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do".
"He's primarily made up of people who would make football for the chosen".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but I can't be blamed for being a sidekick".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to do football for everyone, because then everyone will be happy and not just the chosen ones", Reichl noted.
He's also denying that he's only the Czech president.
"Although some people try to say the opposite, I plan to do my best for Morava".
"For example, it is time to consider dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian divisions, the winners of which would go to the first league".
"There would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian squads in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", said Rajchl.
Since the head of the Plzeň club Tomáš Paclík has also been involved in the fight for the presidency, the Reichl does not dare to estimate his chances of election.
"But I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees clear achievements behind me", said Rajchl, who credits saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law as his achievements.
On the contrary, he blames himself for the union's failure to pull together.
While he declares that Pelt is "disqualified from restoring confidence in Czech football", he considers Paclik's other rivals to be a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year".
"If elected, he would probably continue the things Ivan Hasek started and not change the staffing of the committees in any fundamental way".
"He wouldn't want to turn it to his advantage", the rivals of the Reichl rate.
The Most Beautiful Pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
The following is a list of the names of the persons mentioned in the Annex:
The Octopus, the luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Travelers to Europe can experience its blue wonder - and after sightseeing or traveling, let their tired legs rest in thermal baths.
The book will show you where water wellness is the best.
When Iris Meder set out on her exploration voyages last year and a half, she had to have something in her suitcase: her swimming suit.
Lying on the water, she gazed up into the artistically shaped domes, swam past the marble putti (the figures of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)), which waited for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored secession floats.
If she liked a washing machine, she would quickly put it in her diary - with remarkable details about the building's architecture and history.
More than 200 floating baths have been explored in this way by architectural historian Meder, and are now presented in her newly published book "Badefreuden": the Folk Baths in Munich, the historic palace of the floating baths in Schwarzwald, the "Hard Core of Concrete Buildings" in Taunus.
She has been to 13 countries on her "Road to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of the rafting culture.
Sports are not so extreme, says Meder - only in the water it's different.
The only irritation is that the swimming fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while the health runners can breathe in the intoxicating scent of fir forests or listen to the cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
"One day I asked why the floats had to be so ugly", says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting pretty floats".
Water level doubles the architecture
The plunge in the swimming pool and the essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And if the founders tried, the plungers can be a real treat: "You have the water level in the bathroom instead of the floor".
"It's transparent, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is optically doubled: high vault, colorful stove, jump board.
The small-format picture booklet "Badefreuden" (The Joy of Bathing) provides everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historic oasis of Wellnes - but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by a collector of plague-bearers, Mrs. Meder, during her search in Hungary.
Besides the beautiful medicinal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found water with nitrate content in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
While the whole city is visible from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, the outdoor pool at St. Anton's offers a view of the snow-covered Arlberg - and: The steam-bath has a window from which the ski slopes can be seen.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits guests at the Längenfeld spa: The Ötztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From the top of three open pools in winter, steam rises as the Ötztal mountains in the background glow towards the sky.
The Alhambra in the Schwarzwald
Not every sink Mrs. Meder's pool collector smelled of chlorine in her crunches.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, and the Árpád spa in Békescsaba, Hungary, smells of heating oil to the point that you can hardly believe you've entered the thermal baths.
The scent comes from the medicinal water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a rather peculiar wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spas of Luhačovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902 the baths designed by the architect Dushan Jurkovich were closed.
Looking through the crumbling windows of the red-white-yellow Secession building, Mrs. Meder saw the weeds grow in the tiles.
They stood in the sunset in the magic swimwear shop in Schwarzwald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
The baths have already undergone three phases of construction; one can discover not only the neo-Romanesque elements dating from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a favorite spa spot for pool expert Iris Meder, and not just because she's from Schwarzwald.
"It's quite a feat to combine such diverse structures into such a beautiful complex", says Mrs. Meder.
In a palace like this, diving into a thermal pool is probably a peripheral matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank has its commodities business checked
I 'm not sure .
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a task force to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor world.
Then in January, the CEO wants to draw conclusions.
- What is it ?
For German citizens, the point is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one survey, for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of those questioned even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from the deal because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
That's according to a survey by Force on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges is driving up prices and that banks are therefore complicit in the global hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is specifically aimed at Deutsche Bank CEO Joseph Ackermann, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also doing the same.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
Meanwhile, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk transactions have turned away from supply and demand - and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Ackermann responded to criticism differently from competitors in the United States: he promised to investigate the complaints and said that no deal "was worth putting Deutsche Bank's good name on the line".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is checking the complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be completed by the end of the year, after which the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
The bank's officials then want to announce their conclusions by the end of January.
In the end, it could be a reduction in commodity trade or even total rejection.
Ackermann is working on his own image.
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the report but heightened his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way how ruthlessly banks are today harming the common good".
Let Ackermann, as the top bank lobbyist, be given his duties.
"Deutsche Bank must cut out all items from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned about starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's vision may seem surprising at first, but it's clear that the CEO, a few months before he leaves office, would like to leave a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not be joining the supervisory board, contrary to plan.
By moving away from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about any losses - he should let his successor deal with that eventually.
Every second person would say, "I'm not investing in raw materials".
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode released a poll that the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 11 per cent of respondents considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments involving food price bets.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would be asked to cancel all investments where money is diverted to speculation in raw materials.
Forty-three percent would warn their acquaintances about such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing their account and switching to another institution.
21st-century house in Vienna
Moving pavilion
The following is the text of the Decision:
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World's Fair won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern postwar architecture, to the clear forms, glass halls, bold scales and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a fitting and celebrated example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and impressive steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the Austrian Pavilion for the next World's Fair.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder palace plus a key by-product in Munich, 1973 eventually became internationally famous.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building after the World's Fair, was located in the Schweizer Garten at the Südbahnhof (Southern Station) in Vienna, and was renovated and opened in 1962 as the Museum des 20e Centuries - it was named the "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Yet it was used until the new stand in Vienna was given to contemporary art.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and more and more dilapidated.
Now the pavilion has been reconstructed by the architect Adolf Krischanitz, now bearing the name "House of the 21st Century" and will be used in the future as the Museum of Contemporary Art.
Tuesday night, the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, will open its first exhibition - a happy occasion in every respect.
A new beginning has taken hold, with Agnes Husslein-Arco becoming the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a graduated art historian with a distinguished career, a skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, pushed for a major reconstruction at politicians and monuments, provided public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruby were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to be built, and an office building was to be built.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was the perfect cast to perform.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and extend the Secessionist buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but also because Schwanzer studied with him at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was "an extremely important place" for him, where he viewed exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original project and also the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and changed its use.
The current reconstruction was far more problematic: The building was "a catapult for energy", says Krischanitz.
The windows of the glass facade were replaced, glass fibres reinforced with insulating glass were used and the glass roof replaced with special safety glass.
Cold steel beams were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings were repaired.
Two basements have provided space for new uses, a folded lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, and a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish brown tone.
And the theater is still exactly the same as it was before.
All under the strict supervision of the memorial service and a low budget.
"Often, the materials had to be found that were good and cheap and also liked by the museum", says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and renovations, the building has remained flexible and airy.
The difficulty was with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet to "have the proper self-confidence".
In this case, however, the 21st Century House is not in a bad place, as an urbanist coincidence has occurred: in the ring around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City district at the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and is already reportedly negotiating with the city for a neighborhood in the Schweizer Garten.
The railroad is planning a million-dollar winter crisis package.
The railway has devised an emergency plan to prevent train disruptions during the winter season.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It's going to cost millions.
In order to combat winter-related train disruptions and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional €70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The 'Bild' newspaper provided a preliminary report, citing an internal group plan, that a total of around EUR 300 million was expected to be invested by 2015.
It is said to improve the use of trains and the rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
The plan includes doubling the number of internal and external staff to 16 000 to remove snow from railway installations and platforms.
The aim is to free up the platform for the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary turns over four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, after a high-level meeting with government and industry representatives, the head of the railway, Rüdiger Grube, warned of train disruptions and delays during the winter of this year.
Last winter, the line experienced significant difficulties in passenger traffic, due, among other things, to a lack of reserves in difficult weather conditions.
So many new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railways Authority.
Added to this is the delay in ICE train departures.
The track has also been struggling for years, having to have the axles of ICE trains checked more often by workshops, when one ICE train at Cologne Central Station had its axle destroyed.
Deutsche Bank is paying a million-dollar fine in the US
After the riots over the boss, Joseph Ackermann, there is a new setback in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank had not had enough problems at home, the giant in the industry has caught up with its past in the United States: The Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (€106 million) in settlement proceedings to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage notes.
The NCUA, the financial market regulator, blames a number of large banks for misleading the cooperative banks with false promises to buy financial products; that they may have reduced the risks.
Such securities lost much of their value during the crisis, and the banks were swept along with them.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the matter without having to drag the parties to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank is settling for no fault of its own.
This includes Citigroup, which has committed to paying out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the hospitality of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and helps in bankruptcies to protect customer claims.
NCUA is trying to recover billions in damages.
The settlement now completed is the first of its kind.
The regulator has also taken on other big banks, and this summer it sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The questionable mortgage notes are so-called Mortgage-Backed Securities.
They're based on bank loans.
When the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007, it became a disaster for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-investment bank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Although the events took place several years ago, the banks are now facing a storm.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to punish the irregularities.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
It points out to 18 major international banks that two state-owned American real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have disadvantaged about $200 billion in mortgage transactions.
Deutsche Bank also faces a lawsuit from FHFA, involving a series of transactions totalling approximately $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The Authority asks the Frankfurt Institute to account for 'substantial losses', without however specifying any precise amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unfounded and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
He's bought over $10 billion worth of stock since March.
Until now, the prominent American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
Now, however, he had read IBM's business reports and had changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investments are considered a knight's match in the financial world.
As a result, the IT parent company IBM may now be referred to as 'Sir IBM'.
Because Buffett revealed on the American economic radio station CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM hadn't heard about his involvement.
He praised the management for trying to make even decent returns during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job", Buffett said to strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as running data centres.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has been more than a little shy of tech companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies whose activities he understands.
Instead, Buffett reached out to the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine manufacturer.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway, in addition to its own 80 subsidiaries, also owns shares in a number of large conglomerates such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
The 81-year-old took over a small textile firm, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and, through wise investment, built it into one of the most valuable businesses in the world.
Yet his way of life is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "The Oracle of Omaha".
When Buffett's investment became public, IBM's stock went up 1 percent before the IPO.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also known, has a market value of more than $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the most valuable technology company in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett would not want to step in.
Bill Gates is said to be a close friend of his.
The threat is tangible
After the revelation of the "Zwickau cells", the Turkish media are questioning the German rule of law.
The newspapers even talk about a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was met with fear and concern in Turkey and among the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, it is a return to a horror long thought dead: there has not been a comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993.
There was xenophobia in Germany, but there was never any doubt about it.
But the discovery of a right-wing extremist network reveals a scale that has long since been unseen.
"Is bloody ideology alive again?" was the headline of the Turkish online edition of the newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the department for the protection of the constitution and fears that the German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with caution: It remembered the weekend of demonstrations in silence outside the Brandenburg Gate by victims of racist violence.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish Municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Agreement on recruitment.
In bright colors, life together was staged as a history of success.
The box is the news of several Turkish media: "German gift to the 50s" is the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the serial murder.
The publication of the newspaper "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot fail to make this connection.
"It's starting to smell", is the title of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
It emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made important contributions to the reconstruction of Germany were murdered.
The most critical discussion is in the German-Turkish Internet forums about the police's procedure and its late success in the search.
Why the German authorities did not think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Many thus present themselves as rhetorically ready to use drastic means: "If this superficial activity continues, the immigrants will have nothing left but their own defense and armaments".
"That's probably the best defense".
"The quality of the clarification and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network is very much dependent on the internal peace in Germany", writes "Selen".
Which means if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, they explain the murders in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the Solingen crematorium is deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and alienation can lead to right-wing violence
But the assassinations made the feeling of reciprocity on the Turkish side more apparent.
Not Repeating the Mistakes of the Past
The Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in Mölln who survived.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, but he was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel calculated in his speech what taxes the Turks were paying.
It's as if a man's worth was measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deeply distrusted many German Turks are of the Turkish constitutional order.
In addition to trying to clarify and re-evaluate the far-right terrorism in Germany, this time it requires an open word.
The Bank of Lake Zurich scandal
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS suffered near bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has been slipping from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now some German has to clean it up.
I'm sure that's not what Axel Weber meant.
Following his high-profile departure from the board of directors of the Swiss Federal Bank, it became known in July 2013 that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new position: chairman of the board of UBS, the Swiss banking giant - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was publicly delighted, praising both Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity, and making friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has reached a turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But by September, it was clear that things were going to be different.
One dealer from UBS in London bypassed all the bank's security systems and lost approximately 1.7 billion euros.
The chairman of UBS, Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The chairman of the board of UBS has also been a bit of a scarecrow since then - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already been known that Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over as chairman of the board in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's an economics professor and an emission banker, and he'd definitely need time to work out.
He will then take over responsibility for the strategy of the bank, which has just once again proven itself worthy of the title of "Europe's most scandalous bank".
Because UBS is huge -- until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world -- and it's been sliding from scandal to scandal for years.
Nothing, it seems, will spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a quiet and solid but also cunning asset manager combines with ambitious goals: She also wanted to make a mark in investment banking.
So UBS managed 2007 on the one hand with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it's emerged as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a longtime professor of banking at Zurich, relates: "I always cited UBS as a model of a good bank to my students back then".
"From today's perspective, one asks, 'How could I have been so wrong?'
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the surprisingly stepping down of the chairman Peter Wuffly, who had been considered a highly intelligent and also a brilliant banker.
A few months later, it was clear why he had left.
The bank's investment division squandered the Subprime bonds and had to write off billions.
To counter this, UBS has recommended a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
Instead, she did find investors, but one she would have been covering her nose over recently: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so discreet that you didn't even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
Things were worse in April 2008.
The bank had to admit new billions of losses, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second best paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster struck: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its misinvestment during the financial crisis and had to be bailed out by the State.
Nationalbank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds, which allowed it to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - for they noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to have such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS for 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
"Once again, we could not save UBS", says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For months, UBS had been capitulating in a tax dispute with America, and was willing to release the data of wealthy customers, who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - in return for the unlawful profits from these deals, including a penalty surcharge.
UBS has thus admitted more or less openly that it has contributed to tax cuts.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the holy grail of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
The Chairman of the Board and the President of the Board of Directors resigned.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost credibility in both of its core business areas: investment banking due to bad speculation and asset management for tax relief.
And just as things had calmed down, just as UBS was thought to be recovering, here comes this unfortunate business anabaxis: One dealer lost 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
And what's clear is that risk management in investment banking is still not working.
"The Adoboli case seems to have shown that too little has changed in risk control", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also convinced: "The problem with UBS is that it cannot control risk".
And that was exactly the idea of prudence that the Swiss bankers took long ago to become the custodians of the world's great wealth: no too big risks, but safety for money - again from this side of the Alpine Republic the world collapsed.
The Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli for their high-quality chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich is still a good cliché Swiss private bank - it's just a little bit bigger.
The position is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the rents for the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry stores like Tiffany's can be found here among traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli.
For centuries, it has been home to Swiss banks, from the Nationalbank to the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-covered, and in front of them are massive leather chairs, with a large sign indicating the "safe" next to the bank's logo.
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has been suppressed or betrayed by both the big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but sometimes, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds out.
He would rather not see his name in the papers, and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, he also makes deals with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too big, he finds out, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
I don't think the Swiss have anything to say about it.
"And if they did, they'd adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago".
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that UBS transformed, bringing it first high profits and then disaster: no European financial institution lost as much money in the Subprime jungle as Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was obvious.
"That Wednesday, the coalition government of a small country of seven million decided to launch the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
As much as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, were approved by politicians to rescue a failing superbank.
How could this happen?
If you talk to the Swiss bankers, they see the problem primarily in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a large conglomerate.
The merger created a bank that was already too big for a small Switzerland - and it kept growing.
It helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS were complementary: one rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and a poorer but more internationally involved one.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers had the advantage of a lot of money to spin the big roulette wheel with.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, modest man who knows a lot about models and statistics and Ospel, the man who runs his stomach around feeling, who's worked his way up from banking science".
But I heard that Ospel was counting on Wuffly to finish.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He probably thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, I suppose.
Pride was before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings where CEO Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: "Blow Goldman Sachs down".
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a ranking that documents the success of banks at the time.
In it, UBS was trying to place itself at the very top.
She's done a few steps already.
She was at the top of her game in the foreign exchange and stock markets.
But the business advisers who were in charge point out one weakness: In international interest rate trading, in the bankers' phrase "fixed income", there seems to be a large gap behind the largest banks.
UBS seems to have a gap in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a massive machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgages and passed them on - but also kept the risks to itself.
Also, when the other banks were looking for a way out.
"Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was in flames, UBS was buying", says banking expert Geiger.
The greater the euphoria, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the cleanup efforts were harder than expected.
The UBS position became a catapult seat and is still swinging today.
Whoever's running the supermarket now has a job that's almost impossible.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that all the nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger has an idea: end investment banking, concentration on wealth management, return to Swiss roots.
That's exactly where the bank doesn't want to go.
But investment banking is going to be hit hard, that much is clear now.
Next Thursday, the new CEO of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Swiss Ital was seen as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with its predecessor, Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has insisted he will lead UBS's business in the long term, the Zurich-based bank said Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats are being cut.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to do for money?
These are questions that Axel Weber is asking himself right now.
But so far, all he's said publicly is that he's going to find an apartment in Zurich with his wife first.
I'll see you next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe is weighing on the U.S. stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has discouraged American investors from starting the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not have the intended impact.
The sluggish industrial output on the Continent has stifled the seed of hope for stabilizing the debt crisis.
General facilitation by the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be implemented
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glasses were thought to be half full last week, not half empty - but now problems have come to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
The financial value was mostly on the sales tickets.
The Dow Jones index of standard values was down 0.6 percent at the close of trading at 12,078 points.
During the trading period, the market barometer oscillated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The S&P 500 index, broadly speaking, ended at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index dropped 0.8 percent and exited trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2 percent at 5,985 readers.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has reduced production significantly and is preparing to end the boom.
The figures for the month of September were 2% lower than the previous month, as reported by Eurostat.
"We are not an island, we are dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is not likely to recover from the recession so quickly, and there are other signs of weakness in banks.
Investing legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this view: He said in a CNBC interview that it might not be clear yet whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis.
So it's probably too early for him to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM boosted the stock price of the traditional corporation, leaving it trading against the trend at first almost one percent higher.
The paper ended up almost unchanged at $187.35.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, experts say that these highly intelligent animals have long been unable to be driven out of cities.
Some people like them, others want to get rid of them pretty quickly: Crows have been a part of the city's image for centuries, yet in some communities residents complain about the noise and dirt they cause.
However, no controls have been put in place to control the "problem birds".
Field crows may no longer be able to be driven out of cities, experts said at the first-ever crow symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
Conservationists have also attributed the problems of cities to the exodus of the specially protected field ravens: The use of chemicals in agriculture seems to be destroying traditional habitats at an increasing rate.
The persecution, the growing construction, and the felling of typical nesting trees make life difficult for the birds.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies of more than 600 nesting pairs are found in the northwest of the Westphalian Soest, including in the Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There, a controversial 2005 project to mass-kill crows in a rural district made negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals in bird traps and the beating of the rods particularly brutal.
"Normal chasing, scaring, brings nothing", found urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has unwanted consequences, said Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals retreat, large colonies are split and split into other places".
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out".
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
A combination of driving animals out of sensitive habitat and luring them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws", in contrast, promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One bump in the face is the best way to end up with no self-esteem".
Mrs Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg scientific raven trail in Schleswig-Holstein, which provides information boards on the life of the highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to be already being taken up by tourists.
Mrs Jürgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the bird: "It's all volume of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: The field hawk not only uses a tool to get the grain, but even makes its own tool as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four field ravens to see how far the birds' intelligence had reached.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to cause the stones to collapse to get to the moth larva.
Without much training, they figured out what size and shape a rock must have to cause a platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the spoiled crows then had to solve a more complex problem.
In the vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a mole's larva.
The birds could not reach their prey by the tail.
But the researchers put bits of wire in there.
She used them to form hooks for all four animals, using them as a hook to catch the vessel by the handle from the tube.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do it with a pledge.
Cristiano Ronaldo is shooting Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup have failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are taking part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by two-time superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8.53) Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) to make their fifth consecutive European Championship appearance after a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
The Czechs were able to get a 1-0 (0:0) result in the play-off with the outsider Montenegro, when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia also failed to score with 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland reached a 1-1 draw (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the following goals for Portugal.
Former professional from Wolfsburg of Bundesliga Zvezda Misimovic converted a penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) have been twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was given a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already disappointed Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal has made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo quickly took the lead by suspending a free kick from about 30 metres into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his skills in long-range shooting, adjusting his 25-meter shot to 2-0.
The Bosnians, who didn't play in the first half, had their first clear shot at goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
The former Wolfsburg player from the English club Manchester City, who is at the top of the table, put the ball on the bottom edge of the net with his head, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Finally, the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was in the center.
After the intervention against Helder Postig in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36)
On the other side, Stark made a controversial penalty kick after Fabio Coentraa's action, which Misimovic definitely turned.
But after the break, the 2004 European vice-champion made it clear with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This is the 1976 European champion's fifth consecutive trip to the European Championships.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomáš Pekhart (1 FC Norimberk) also had luck and had to overcome a terrible second already in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech reflexively prevented the possible own goal of Tomáš Sivok (9.) at the last moment.
Montenegro had its best chance when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot from the penalty area in the 40th minute just past Chekhov's goal.
After the break, the cross-country skier had to save the place of the already knocked down world-class Czech goalkeeper, again lowered the forward FC Soul (50.).
The door finally cleared up shortly before the end.
Turkey missed the football miracle in Zagreb.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks are 0-0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to leave his place on the bench for third place at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can rejoice at their fourth appearance in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost epic start.
Sel Incukan hit only the bat in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, the striker Kazim also could not hang the bounced ball in the goal.
After that terrible second, Croatia was taking more and more control.
Also, after the interruption, the Croatians didn't get the gate.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who released Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni is going to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had taken a 4-0 lead in the first leg of the preliminary, into the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57) tied for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defence prevent a possible lead goal.
But in the 32nd minute, it was a long way.
After a failed defense by goalkeeper Paul Londak, Ward was in position and pushed the ball over the line to 1-0.

SAP wants to double its workforce in China.
Europe's largest software maker SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double its workforce in the country.
By 2015, it is said to have reached about $2 billion (about 1.5 billion euros), Dax said on Tuesday.
"We're going to build more research and development facilities and we're going to hire the right people", said Bill McDermott, the deputy director, at a consumer trade show in Beijing.
The staff has now grown from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of branches of the world's number one enterprise software company will double from five to ten or eleven.
The Commission also notes that the Chinese exporting producers have not been able to demonstrate that the measures in question are compatible with the internal market.
About 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are in a booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of Dax's strategy for 2015.
SAP wants to increase its turnover to EUR 20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfs embezzled about 12.5 billion euros.
Today, the software maker, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is doing almost as well as ever.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We would like to expand our activities (...) ", said McDermott.
"Our goal is to support sustainable growth in China through extensive research".
The massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a list of characters that will make your head spin.
One tip for the moment: Carefully tear this page out and make it a bookmark.
You will get to know all the characters in Mr. Englund's novel very well, and this list will serve as a navigation - a beacon - for those moments when you, like the men and women in the story, feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new vice-president of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are discussing here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite aptly, as "an anti-historical work".
It contains several well-known names, important treaties or famous battles, but it is almost missing ambassadors, energetic journalists, and discussions of tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, explains the author, as it is "a book about what it was like". It is mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 or so men and women on both sides of the barricade, from female students and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people are gonna be heroes.
Others will become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives are fading like the flames of a candle lit in a church - new ones are being added to the web of destinies while others are dying out.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
It distorts the idea that the First World War was all about the terrible trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" also expertly explores other places where war dramas have taken place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book deal with problems like being hit by bee nests, having to spend Christmas in the shadow of pyramids, or dealing with the presence of much tsetse.
Almost from the beginning, it's a very moving read.
War will consume people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling of gunpowder.
If gunfire starts in the distance and you're a woman at home with your children, will you run or stay?
Who's coming?
Almost no one understands what's going on, even why the whole war was started.
"The vacuum created by the lack of facts", Mr. Englund observed, "was filled with conjecture, conjecture, hope, fear, prejudice, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are widely adapted from biographies, letters, and other published material.
The accounts of their lives may sound frightening and fascinating, but the incorporation of minute moments and details makes them absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them are about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says, "Stuff, everywhere substitutes".
"Coffee cask, imitation aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons. " I was just wondering if you could help me out.
He goes further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in skimmed fat (and supplemented with a false bone of wood), dried root tobacco and dried potato skins, wooden-soled shoes".
It mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in sausage making and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
One American finds an innate drive for savagery and brutality, and then says of war: "Eventually you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, the evening paper or a good book, and pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization, and that behind the starched self inside you there is no barbarian".
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he will most likely die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When one finally accepts the sacrifice, one would expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience", he writes.
Instead, he feels like "a convict being secretly hanged".
Further remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the advent of new horrors.
"Conflict became more and more an economic competition and a competitive struggle", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
He captured what he called "a new kind of beast of the coming century: a verbal and ideologically committed mass murderer in tailor-made clothes, who sheds his blood without getting up from his desk".
People act in a way that's totally unexpected, villainy alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexually transmitted disease from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonokok pus, which soldiers bought and applied to their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"The most desperate rubbed it in their eyes, often blinded for the rest of their lives".
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is fleeting but not flashy, which is a perfect fit for his human theme.
In dozens of small performances, he captures the way the war "unleashed forces that were completely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books about World War I have mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as "World War I and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussell or novels like "Silence on the Western Front" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers the unconventional concept.
His book has the most crushing ending in popular science literature.
But I won't tell you.
But you'll feel like the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped a page from your hero list out of your hand, and burned it.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute, a precisely planned raid
Hundreds of police officers participated, some wearing street riot helmets.
Monday-Tuesday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park should be almost empty by then.
No one knew about the operation except a few high-ranking officers, who were told at first that it was a training exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in charge of the operation, and his presence highlighted the problems faced by the police department during the operation.
There should be no repeat of the cases of the past few weeks, where pepper spray was used against demonstrators, which violated departmental rules and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy shifted to the squatters.
Thus, the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was only launched after two weeks of careful planning and practice.
The leaders were inspired by the operations in other cities.
A massive emergency behaviour exercise was held at Randalls Island in preparation for the Zuccotti Park event.
Officials have stepped up so-called riot control training - counterterrorism measures involving rapid deployment of large numbers of police - with a focus on Lower Manhattan.
The final part of the training took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move into the park literally came "at the last minute", said someone who was initially told the operation was just "a drill".
"I know a few police officers who were called in to the operation, and they certainly weren't told they were going to Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew about the Zuccotti Park trip".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned once before.
On October 14th, the city officials planned to clean up the park, but then they backed off because as soon as the protesters heard about it, hundreds of them joined the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action involved police from various units, including task forces from around the area - dozens of police officers who are routinely used to reinforce high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day, a large number of people come and go in the park, so one o'clock at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do it at a time when there are few people in the park", he said.
Before the troops left, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, with emergency vehicles with arc lights and amplifiers.
The lights and recorded messages from the amplifiers frightened many demonstrators.
When law enforcement officers in blue fancy dresses entered the park, many protesters packed their things and left.
Police say they didn't touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving the protesters time to pack their things.
Additional police teams have been seen gathering at the edge of the park to break in if any arrests are needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne claimed that it was for their safety.
However, many journalists believe that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their troops in action, and that some police officers treated them roughly.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street leading along the western boundary of the park could shoot without any problems.
Police advanced westward, intertwined with a thick confiscation of the protesters' personal belongings, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the sanitation department, who immediately cleared whatever was left in the park.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and documentary footage surfaced on the Internet shortly after.
The most violent group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen of their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some of them created a roadblock and the police began their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp joined each other.
And two people tied to a tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly reported.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, according to police.
Mr. Browne said that approximately 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "organizing riots and resisting arrest", he explained.
The highest ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the police department's commander, the highest ranking uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the division's chief of detectives, was also personally involved in the operation.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the management of the operation", Mr. Browne said.
A second group of officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south of the park, were barricaded.
From these locations, police then developed a security belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many with shields, were seen pushing people even further across the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., one protester was seen south of Pine Street jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were seen blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of the splinter flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for the dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month plan to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
A court appeal is probably the last option left to the unions in District Council 37 in their quest to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, 672 school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, some of the city's lowest-paid, were laid off, described by union leaders as retaliation by the city for not allowing them access to the squad-run health care fund last spring, which the city used to fill a budget gap.
City officials have categorically denied the accusation.
At a city council meeting last month, Education Secretary Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget passed in June.
One member of the board immediately countered by saying that there was no specific mention of redundancies in the budget.
City officials from District Council 37 announced that they had already filed the required paperwork and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him, and they are holding a press conference on Wednesday to formally announce the lawsuit in Manhattan's state supreme court.
The defendants in the case will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city has not yet seen the lawsuit, and will not comment on individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of layoffs in poor parts of the city, in order to support their claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied sufficient funding for a long time.
They point out that while there was no school closure at all in Staten Island and only minimal in the Upper East Side, 17 school assistants were laid off in Brooklyn, in District 23 in Brownsville, and even 46 in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that Public School 36 in Harlem lost five of its eight assistants, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. "This is not a neighborhood full of poor parents who can afford to pay for the budget deficit", the lawsuit says.
Public School 36's budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated bonus funds for every poor student who signed up.
The unions claim, among other things, that the principals of secondary schools may have been confused by the way the document authorizing the dismissal of the parent coordinators was written.
The document used the word 'excess' to describe the action, i.e. to abolish the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of a teacher from the school payroll to the database of available staff whose wages are paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators were laid off", the complaint states, "and not merely moved to the database as available staff".
Mission is complete, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya.
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are coming to an agreement on something concerning the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of U.S. troops had to be ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on a statement endorsed by Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.) in which she should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and thank U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"With this statement, we want to recognize the courage of the Libyan people who have begun to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express support for their democratic efforts".
These sentences may seem innocent, but no debate that has ever touched on Libya has been easy.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both parties have been in constant debate with each other and the White House about the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States' military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the House because of differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the House rejected the bill, the House also rejected a measure that would have stopped funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the U.S. mission in Libya was literally in a legislative purge -- Congress criticized the way President Obama was running the mission, but members of Congress obviously didn't get upset enough to stop supporting him in his efforts.
The weight of the congress was eventually overtaken by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and on October 20th, Gaddafi was killed.
NATO officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the Commission on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "commends the men and women of the United States armed forces and their allies who have taken part in the operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism".
The statement also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new proposal gain the full support of the International Relations Commission, or will the legislators be split in half again, as they were when the June proposal was passed?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the Republican Party's top representative on the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday he hadn't seen the final version of the new bill yet.
The House is voting this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, championed by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other subject to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far, despite considerable efforts, not succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the Constitution that were introduced in Congress, touching on a wide range of different issues.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal put before the House and the Senate - and others are just minor modifications of the others.
In the House alone, there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
While some of the proposals are identical, their proponents - especially the Republican nominees who want to improve their reputations - can boast of their "authorship".
The budget adjustment bill, which was approved in August, required the House and Senate to vote on the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of terms congressmen can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of terms he can serve as president.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a series of amendments that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage and the amendment banning burning the national flag remain permanent.
Some lawmakers also want to allow for the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in proposing various amendments, they do not deviate significantly from the average compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress, they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress, there were 66.
In fact, their activity pales in comparison with the early 1990's, when, according to Senate Library statistics, members offered more than 150 supplements every two years.
But they were not much more successful than the politicians of today.
The last amendment that was added, the 27th amendment, was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Breaked, but not defeated", says Gifford in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after being shot at close range at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, singing along to a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow", and declared that she needed to recover more than returning to Congress.
Giffords appeared on ABC News's "20/20" with Diane Sawyer, and it was seen that she was still having trouble making sentences and needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a gunshot wound that had pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left hemisphere of her brain, and ejected from the back of her head.
Three months ago, she made a surprise return to the House to take a triumphant vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 others were injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords replied: "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special on "20/20", which aired the night before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
Special ops has been tracking Gifford's recovery since the Jan. 8 shooting.
The videos that Kelly shot during the first few weeks, you can see Giffords in a hospital bed with her head shaved and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can't do more than lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair, and the therapists are teaching her how to perform simple tasks.
A nod of the head.
Spitting lips.
And then, her first word: "What".
Within days, Giffords had uttered another word - "toast" - when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
The videos shown by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords' recovery: the congresswoman and her therapist singing to the tune of Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
During the interview, Gifford, who spends two hours a day in therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she has no memory of the day of the shooting.
Her husband said that Gifford had read newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12th, when she first asked him who the six who had been killed in the incident was.
The suspect in the shooting is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison under the influence of a violent drug pending trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Wow, that was awful, awful".
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during his recovery, his wife declared, "I lost".
"So I told her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose,'" Kelly described.
"You just got your ass kicked.
But you'll get through it, you'll get back together, and you'll come back stronger than ever".
Military units are met with more compassion than respect
The event was a gala event on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for veterans in New York City who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness and frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines gathered around him.
The crowds, dressed in formal attire, rose and applauded enthusiastically.
"The men and women in the military were considered heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
The ceremony was attended by the then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, who had a somewhat different view of the role of the military.
"They were all presented as some kind of orphan", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was pity.
So the very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes celebratory American public.
The military is boundlessly enveloped in praise for its sacrifices.
But the praise is worth something, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting as if they're pitying the individual in uniform.
"We're not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unfortunate souls".
This is a sensitive issue for military commanders who don't want to appear ungrateful or to ruin their relationship with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by troops returning from Vietnam was far worse.
As a result, most words of remorse are said in silence and in private among war veterans.
When two sons of retired Colonel Mark Canciano returned from combat service in the Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles by those outside the military.
From the perspective of some, he will feel respect and awe, having defeated hostile rebels and visited exotic places.
Others, however, will wonder if "under the surface there is an evil, violent veteran", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to Washington to take a seat in the government.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people he interviewed subtly suggested that he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your ministry, you must expect negative reactions", Cancian instructed his sons.
The army's discomfort stems in part from American indifference to war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely recognized in a country that has little knowledge of its own military and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we did during World War II", declared Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the main focus of political and public recognition is the suffering of men with guns.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military faces mounting pressure to crack down on rape
This week, the court will decide whether to prosecute 28 men and women against the military for alleged inaction in a rape case.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are ready to sue.
Private Elizabeth Lyman, first class, was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague.
It was October 2008, and she was on her way to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego, and after dinner with a friend, she came across a male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if he could join her, if they could have a few drinks in her room.
"A warning light flashed in my head", Lyman described.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, "No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts".
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will await the verdict of a hearing that could have historic impact in Arlington, Virginia, and will determine whether the charges against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The indictment says Gates and Rumsfeld failed to fight the spread of rape in the military, which violates the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington attorney Susan Burke, and the plaintiff party had 17 members at the time, but over the following months the number grew to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their fellow soldiers and that the military had failed to investigate, punish or seek any justice after reporting the attacks.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking military commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a directive system", he says.
"Who are the people in a position to prevent efforts to implement measures against such acts?
Burke also claims that since February, she's contacted at least 400 other survivors, many of whom could become part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: Rather than lump all the charges into one case - putting all the eggs in one basket, as she says - she will file multiple lawsuits in different cases if necessary to keep the pressure on.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who, along with his associates, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense strategy - basically, current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under the Supreme Court's 1950 order known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs", the document says.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
Things have changed since the 1950's.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is just a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in communicating with civilian women in war zones.
The result: 150 female soldiers died in these wars - two thirds of them directly in combat.
It's time to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and there are three other lawyers on the case.
At Yale Law School, veterans of the legal services seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly fostering an atmosphere of misogyny.
In addition, a nonprofit organization of American Vietnam veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military, which focuses on diagnosing "personality disorders" that were allegedly detected in rape victims so that the military can have a pretext to release them - a practice that activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network say is commonplace.
Her group filed a motion to sue a state veterans' organization in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in processing requests for assistance from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the workplace.
Nine separate motions were tabled in the Congress by a group of senators and members of parliament from both political parties, proposing a range of remedial measures.
According to the Department of Defense Office for Sexual Violence Prevention and Response, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, these types of attacks remain largely unreported, and according to the Pentagon's own estimates, this number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The March report also analyzes the rate of criminal prosecutions of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported to the military went to court - half as many as in the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the assaults as just the first of a series of traumas.
For example, Lyman, a private first class, reported an alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to have occurred.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat the details of her rape 11 times to various police, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the tests necessary to determine rape, and her bed was found to contain the assailant's blood - from the wound she had inflicted on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing where she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six individuals were called as reputed witnesses in favor of the alleged offender, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down", says Lyman.
"I felt like I was about to give birth - I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"I was placed in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'This was not his trial. This was mine.'
The Lymans ordered her to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged from the army, thus without any right to serve.
Whether or not the Lyman and other plaintiffs move on to the next phase is a long-term process, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
Of course, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next phase of the negotiations".
But between them and the verdict stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized since it first saw the light of day.
I myself have been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their duties do not allow them to maintain the same level of incentives and deterrents.
He adds: "The odds are stacked against them... but it's important for them to try".
Change will only come when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not end in their favor, Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will assemble hundreds of other individuals ready to sue and begin work on further cases on the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, where reform will not come from", he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Study You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to the July killing spree that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public trial.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was certainly not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites, during the preparations for the attack.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists are eager to learn more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy - just go to Facebook.
"We realized that getting them isn't that hard at all", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The personal data on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that researchers could simply use the ads on the page to pinpoint the target demographic with absolute accuracy - something marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, and they targeted them with ads, but instead of inviting them to join the new group or offering them dietary products, they asked them to fill out a questionnaire asking about their education level, their attitude to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries - without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: the online followers of right-wing groups are mostly young men, driven by the rising rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen".
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers are using these sites to study everything from health issues to social trends hidden in status updates, wall posts, and "like" buttons.
Facebook has over 800 million active users, each of whom provides three different pieces of data on average every day, making it a social networking "information supernova" that is literally driving a lot of new research, and the number of academic papers with the word Facebook in their names has increased by almost 800% from five years ago.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it allows them to study people without having to harass them on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You'd have to get to a party where they'd never let you in", says Bartlett.
"Facebook is tearing this down -- you just go right to it".
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren at the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that college students who discussed their drinking experiences on Facebook were much more likely to have a drinking problem than students who kept quiet about the subject.
Moren suggests that peers monitor the site and offer to help a student who posts too many drunk status.
"You can't solve a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, Dr. Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington.
"We've found a way to identify at-risk children who we wouldn't have had a chance to discover otherwise".
Facebook itself is constantly probing its users' data.
The site's information team compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day relationship, voter turnout in 2010, and the nation's satisfaction ratio (mainly using information they had access to - proponents of Internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure trove available to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the page is required to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of research they don't even know about?
Scientists have clear rules about how to collect data offline, but online data is available to everyone.
"I don't think most users even thought that researchers could look at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"If it was them, they took it as information between themselves and their friends".
The question of methodology is also to be considered.
Even in an offline research, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
There is no way to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off of Facebook are two completely different things", Selwyn explains.
That is why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, believes that pencil and notebook still remain the best research tools.
"When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it's something that can't be replaced", he says.
"Social research should be about society and social activity -- and hell, a lot of social activity still happens offline".
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to orchestrating two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Knights Templar", he declared in front of a court where 500 people gathered.
"I object to the court's decision that you were given a mandate by an organization that promotes a hate ideology and that promotes multiculturalism".
"I confess my actions, but I admit no guilt for them".
During this monologue, Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to present his views".
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech, the opportunity to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for four weeks, and announced that the authorities would have complete control over all his visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of victims and survivors.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
They all came together to move the case to a speedy conclusion.
"I found him cold and inhuman", one survivor told NRK.
"It was not pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I went a little further mentally".
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing, entering and exiting the building without difficulty, looking the journalists present and the survivors in the eye.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge found him not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplices.
It may be a comfort to some that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically lessen the grief and confusion that still linger in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a monster, but she's not", said a relative of one of the victims.
"If I did, everything would be a lot easier".
7 lessons from a lost interview with Steve Jobs in a movie coming out this week
As soon as Steve Jobs died on October 5th, opinions began to emerge that compared him to Henry Ford and voted him for his genius as the Greatest Modern Inventor.
In the recently rediscovered interview with Jobs, which was pulverized for a special movie that's heading to theaters this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind had a perfect understanding of the business processes and workflows behind his products.
A brilliant designer, dreamer, and self-styled hippie, he was also a pedantic organizer and a man who worked every detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffered from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work . . . [but] there is still a long way to go between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was working on the TV show Triumph of the Computer Madmen, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers, and during the filming, a unique interview took place, lasting over an hour.
By this time, it had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was busy with his new computer company, NeXT, and he was eager to see the general public embrace the Internet.
The TV show ended up using only a short portion of the entire Cringely interview, and the original copies of the interview were rumored to have been lost in the shipment.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This very material, slightly cut, forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to select theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who's famous for his reluctance to give lengthy interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic about being able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And he also turns out to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during an interview, there's a longer pause between the question and the answer -- 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, where you can see Jobs thinking through the answer perfectly to make it as accurate and precise as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, when he seems impatient with Cringely's questions, pushing him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod, or the iPhone, and it's a terrifyingly prophetic thought as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing well and badly, while offering his own vision of the future of computer technology.
It's one thing to read the post-mortem reviews of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here as a keen dreamer in the prime of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
Before long, after he had spoken his thoughts, he began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run the business:
"Over the years of business, I've always asked, 'Why do you do this?' and the answer has always been the same: 'Well, this is just how it's done.'"
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business matters.
I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - they often started with "standard costs", you could only guess at their amount - and at that point he decided to go his own way - he developed an automated tool that guaranteed that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he did the cross-pollination on the pope:
Jobs remembers the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into the phone company and call anywhere in the world for free.
Much has been written about this device in the past, but Jobs' enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as an instrument of power is literally contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the device using a pay phone and during the call, they had it be switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
"We've been around the world like this at least half a dozen times, so when we shouted something into the pay phone, it would ring a minute later from the other phone at the door", Jobs laughs.
"We were young and we realized that we could build something that could run a billion-dollar infrastructure around the world".
We, the two of us, built a little thing that could control a much bigger giant -- it was an incredible experience, and I don't think Apple would have ever been built without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke that he and Wozniak almost got to the end of, where they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via the Blue Box, asking if they could speak to the Pope, making the best of it by impersonating Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, more and more high-ranking members of the Catholic Church were called in to speak with an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before the Pope himself was awakened, the couple opened their mouths and hung up.
How he fell in love with technology (and talked to Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and looking for spare parts to build a meter, he found Bill Hewlett's number in the phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute conversation, Jobs had secured a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had an incredible impact on me. It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees".
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was like a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor, and I fell in love with it right away.
As a teenager, I got higher and higher at HP, and I was hanging around this computer and I was writing programs for it.
How they invent innovation:
In several places during the interview, Jobs talks about how he's coming up with new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he went out to sell some circuit boards, a customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days to design, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
Later, when he was at Apple, he recalls the problems they faced in developing the computer mouse:
"I remember having a pretty wild argument... yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300], when I stopped enjoying it, I went out and found a designer".
90 days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for 15 dollars.
How big companies are breathless:
Long before he led the resurrection of Apple, Jobs had predicted that many industry leaders would falter in their vision and lose market share.
"Let's say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what do you do?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can't be more successful.
At this point, marketing and sales are the norm, so companies are run by people who are in charge of that, while people who are in charge of their own products are being pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has brought the company to its unshakable position is now being replaced by people who have no idea what is good or bad - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could own literally the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, it could be Microsoft of the '90s...
Instead of winning, they lost.
How he sees innovation as an art form:
"There's a long way to go and a lot of work to do between a great idea and a great product... and as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about him in that time.
You have to make a whole range of compromises - certain things you just can't make electrons, glass, robots or factories do.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your head all the time -- different concepts -- and put them together...
It's all about taste, in the end, you try to think of the best things that humanity has ever created, and somehow you try to translate them into what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed of stealing the best ideas.
The reason the Macintosh was so amazing and successful was because the people who worked there were brilliant musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, and coincidentally, the best computer scientists in the world.
Without computers and new technology, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with health care law opponents while their case was being heard in court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether to accept an objection to President Obama's health care bill, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a celebratory dinner sponsored by a law firm that will attend the trial.
The event occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the motions.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the sweeping health care overhaul passed by Congress last year - a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, which will also result in a more thorough presidential election scheduled for 2012 and in full swing by the time the ruling is issued.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the bill rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has long advocated for conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the law-challenging trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business.
The next sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., for which huge amounts of money are at stake in the trial.
The dinner was held at a hotel in Washington, D.C., hours after the court hearing on the case.
Attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a staunch opponent of the health care bill.
And the introduction of the guests?
It's nothing new: these two judges have been involved in the Federalist Society's activities for years.
And it's definitely not anything that's against ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to observe the code of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
If this were not the case, however, their conduct would certainly fall under principle C4, which states that 'a judge may participate in events organised by related and other organisations for the purpose of raising funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honored guest or be included in the programme of the event'.
Yet Scalia and Thomas' relationship to the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code of conduct contradicts the assertion of several justices that the Supreme Court follows the same rules as all other federal judges", stated Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
"Judges drinking and dining at the benefit with lawyers waiting to hear their case in court".
Their presence and help in raising funds through this event undermines the feet with all the claims of impartiality, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little sympathy for their critics, telling them that they too have no problem combining their judicial duties with the actions of groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
The Conservatives also argue that the ethical issue is with Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was acting attorney general under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan's critics are pressing her to renounce her involvement in the case, saying she fought for the law too hard to be impartial now.
Kagan has made no indication that she intends to resign.
Boeing has won a record $18 billion jet order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 jetliners with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Aman Air, for which it receives more than USD 1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of their products, it's usually no reason to celebrate.
But if that company is Boeing Co. and the price of those 50 planes is a record $18 billion, that's another thing.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft over the weekend - 50 two-seater Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Emirates Airline based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing announced that the airlines had the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to USD 26 billion.
Then on Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8, sometimes referred to as the Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel economy and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is excellent news for Boeing as a whole", said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing nations of the region.
That means not only do they have the money to pay for planes, but the increase in fuel prices -- mostly damaging to the airline, because it's one of its biggest costs -- is not so crucial, because the country itself is making money off of higher oil prices.
This is important because it is not as likely as other airlines that they could cancel or postpone airline orders because of rising fuel prices, says Dihora.
"They have such natural protection", he says.
The order from Emirates consolidates Boeaing's leading position in the wide-body market and puts Airbus SAS in a tight spot, which wanted to try to undermine Boeing's dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing's victory comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the first flight of its largest aircraft, the A350, a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The delay was due to customer demands for a larger payload and range, so the manufacturer took time to provide more engine power to the machine.
The share price of Boeing Co increased by 1.5% to USD 67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president has apparently been defeated in the Michoacan election.
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of the PRI, was helped in his quest for the governorship by drug traffickers.
Felipe Calderona's sister, who apparently lost a violent state election for governor of Michoacán, claimed Monday that one of her opponents was helped to win by drug dealers.
Preliminary results have given the lead in the governorship election of the western state to Faust Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The interference of organized crime members in the entire electoral process and especially in yesterday's election itself is alarming not only for Michoacán but for our entire country", Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the opinion polling group... seized polling stations, built roadblocks... and made people vote for the PRI order.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
But he plans to return to power soon, and winning the election in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
It seems Vallejo beat Calderon, who was leading the day before the election, by a very narrow margin.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as the winner.
Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far held the governorship, came in third, with a very unfortunate defeat ahead of the 2012 presidential election for the disputed and unfortunate party.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, has denied any ties to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoacán has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calderon, and it was in Michoacán that he launched a military campaign against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence continued.
The mayor of PAN, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates withdrew from the election out of fear.
But whatever the outcome of the Michoacán election looks like for the PRI, a victory will help the party gain new momentum.
The PRI's expected presidential candidate, Enrique Pena Nieto of Wahington Valley, congratulated Valley and said: "I think this victory could be very encouraging in view of the year ahead".
ADB calls on Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be ready to help rescue the euro area from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall downturn in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must "do everything in their power" to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European problems "too carefully" and said that Asian financial aid combined with European leadership and resources would help to stave off a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is welcome", he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it is certainly not immune".
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it".
The European Monetary Association has been severely tested by the severe debt crisis for several months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The growing debt crisis in Europe has raised concerns that it could push the global economy back into recession, and there have been calls for the emerging leading economies to come together to help the eurozone find solutions.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the bond purchases of the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - would give Asian partners of European countries greater negotiating power.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do what it can" to help the Eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from declining exports and drying up foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he declared.
"We face a difficult challenge and we must maintain high growth rates".
"It's not an alternative, it's a fact, because how else would we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that emerging economies, such as India's, have little to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said that it would be very difficult politically to explain the help for Europe to the 1.2 billion people of India, when 800 million of them live on 2 dollars or less a day.
"One day they might find that Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their vacations on the beaches, which they might find hard to explain", he noted.
Lee Howell, Director-General of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain well-paying jobs for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis was threatening a "dangerous domino effect".
The Bank's forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011 and 2012 now faces a 'risk of decline' due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "contract spending plans" to protect them from a downturn and a significant capital outflow from their economies.
Warning from the Pentagon about possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta put the kettle on when he warned Monday in Congress that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting at the Pentagon and continuing through the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion in budget cuts over the next 10 years, but now it fears another $600 billion if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The consequences of these cuts would be devastating to the entire department", Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach agreement on the budget and the resulting so-called stalemate would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and halt many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, applied in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our building or ship projects - you cannot buy only three quarters of the buildings or ships.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian employees, and since the reduction is going to happen so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet targeted demands".
"These changes could shake the faith of those who care for our military and seriously damage its readiness".
Eventually, the cuts will affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"While the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this provision, further operations there will be negatively affected by major changes in other budgets", Panetta warned.
"There will be cuts in contract staff, "which will delay the contractual arrangements to support the war effort of our people".
'The situation of paid staff will be reduced, which will also result in late payments to suppliers and the consequent disruption of legal and political support.'
Both senators wrote Panetta ten days ago asking for details regarding the possible impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of the Department of Defense shutdown could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as the world's military power".
"We are strongly opposed to this harsh measure", the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they released Panetta's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we certainly don't want to sign it".
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow".
"It remains to be seen whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings will increase pressure on Congress to pass the budget and intensify the voices calling for the Pentagon to be left off the list of off-limits areas.
Panetta has been more and more open about possible cuts recently, even though he himself had risen to his high-ranking position at the Pentagon with years of experience in congressional and White House budget approval, so he knew he was getting into a tough fight.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister gave a brief picture of what his department might expect - an army shell with no core inside.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors".
"It'll be like a brigade without ammunition".
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots".
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission", Panetta said at the beginning of a speech at the Pentagon.
"It will be like a unit without morale, unprepared and unable to cope with a potential enemy".
"As a result, aggression will be welcomed by... "
In the annex accompanying the letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, it specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: delayed response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significantly reduced opportunities for landings and deployments worldwide; and an expected unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could be expected to be completed, including those already being tested and those in the early planning stages.
The list included the F35 project, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal combat ship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines wanted to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next decade, but its proponents say it's a necessary next step in military improvement needed to deal with potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glance at recent headlines suggests just how serious and pervasive lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing several women of sexual harassment - both sides claim the other is lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury after trying to cover up records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and stability in many countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by publishing information that was immediately disproved by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing campaign funds to try to conceal his extramarital affair.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that swept around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual encounter with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating in schools and colleges everywhere.
There are instances where teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their own grades.
Mentors who should teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and deception are acceptable.
How many scams are we dealing with?
Studies show you lie anywhere from 10 to 200 times a day.
Suppose many of them are merciful lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Lies detection, or "lying-recognition", is an essential skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or professional reasons.
But it's not a social game that's like, say, Charades, where you scream, "I got you". Deception detection is a serious branch of science that works with scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, especially in psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars are looking you in the eye.
It's not like they're shaking, or whining, or blushing, or sewing.
Of course, do not assume that liars are somehow difficult to spot and detect.
A trained lie detector can detect the truth from sentence structure, tiny facial expressions, the way questions are formed and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from the vast and growing field of lie detection, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that can be easily learned and can be of great help in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiating, or managing people.
Good liars read people, let them be alert, direct their emotions, and intuitively perceive how they're perceived.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more "other-centered" lies -- mostly to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than single people do (although the lies they tell tend to be "disgraceful").
We also know that if you're perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's normal behavior.
It's called "initial observation".
It will give him later findings to compare with.
Notice the subject's posture, his laughter, his voice work.
You should know if someone is regularly knocking so that you don't falsely accuse them of lying just because they start knocking in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But consider these as warning signs, not proof of a lie.
Liars may stop moving their upper body as they try to recall their fabricated story, may turn their shoe to the door, lean out, change their posture dramatically, or display "relief at the end of the conversation" - exaggerated breathing and changing posture when it is difficult to confess behind them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what relief will be when it is over.
Also, notice the language of the subject.
The story is famous for how Scott Peterson once used his past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which triggered a nationwide search for her body.
Liars may also express themselves in a moderate way, "I had no sexual relations with Mrs. . . . Miss Lewinsky", or repeat the difficult question all the way through.
The most common verbal signs are only very slight.
One can use a lot of "soothing language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge".
Such a response does not reveal much of the facts and often provides another warning signal.
There is no magic that can detect every lie, but it is possible to acquire skills that can help you detect a lie.
With these skills, a person will have a better chance of avoiding being a liar and a fraud in his personal and professional life.
The controversial pipeline project will be reversed after the threat of delayed approval by the US government
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - putting unions against each other but reassuring environmentalists - the company in charge of the pipeline announced that it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would move a planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident the project will still be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the Nebraska government headquarters.
TransCanada's boss, Alex Pourbax, claims that the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will follow a different route.
This announcement comes after the State Department announced last week that it was postponing a decision to grant federal approval for a project from which it would not conduct studies of possible alternative routes that would allow it to avoid reaching the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is really a step forward", Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after next year's election, but the authorities deny that politics played any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
1,700 miles of pipeline will connect Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It flows 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This route will take you through six states.
This project is hated by environmentalists, but loved by the workforce, who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will be created by the pipeline.
However, Nebraska legislators opposed the plan, considering legislation that would force the company to withhold its access to the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala watershed, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said the department's inspector general ordered a re-examination of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two questions.
One was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, had presented a conflict of interest in the program.
The Commission also examined whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not inappropriately chosen because it had links with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of making the toddler vomit
A New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter into vomiting.
The singer's "Lady Marmalade" performance frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "a heightened fear of strangers", her family claims in a suit filed in Manhattan Superior Court.
On November 10th of last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were getting ready for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk pulled up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard home with her luggage and Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby down for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to pick her up".
LaBelle was angry and reprimanded the pregnant woman.
"In an aggressive tone, she said, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you think.'"
She got angry and started talking dirty - loudly shouting the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her and she started pouring water on me.
She claims Genevieve had a hysterical attack.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter.'" The child's mother declared.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother, who was still holding Genevieve, and had to be stopped by her escort, who then dragged her to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk testified.
Meanwhile, her daughter screamed so much she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a letter apologizing, but they received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson are not responding to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit is seeking more unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate all proceeds to a charity that helps children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions", Davis said.
"This behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when directed at a school teacher holding an 18-month-old child".
The climate has slowed the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, Sinaloa experienced an increase in unemployment and insecurity, a decline in foreign investment, and with it, a decline in the economy.
2011 will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as the first year of the government of Maria López Valdez, who calls herself the government of change, which has brought great expectations in terms of economic progress, but due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, no growth was recorded and even the main indicators of economic development declined.
The low temperatures in February caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth potential of the state economy, and caused a 3.6% decline in economic activity in the first half of this year, with agriculture experiencing a historic decline of 31.16%, which has also disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares of cultivated land were damaged, of which 78.03% were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% were partially damaged.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state recorded an increase during the first three quarters. From January to March, 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing an unemployment rate of 4.53% of the economically active population. In the second quarter, unemployment increased to 5.28% and between July and August, the average unemployment rate continued to grow and reached a value of 6.19%, representing approximately 74,000 unemployed.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are seeing rising unemployment, which is related to a variety of factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation passed by Congress to combat money laundering, and it is not easy for people who illegally take over dollars to make, invest or use them", he said.
Stopping migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the demographic factor also contributes to the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people going abroad to work, to the United States, has been declining, both because of the difficulty of entry and because even when these people get across the border, it's hard for them to find work, so people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment is rising", he said.
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing uncertainty that prevails in the area of working conditions.
Added to the unemployment and insecurity are other labour market features such as low wages, which are among the lowest in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa State was 5,352 pesos as of September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with declining economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 also saw the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment in the period from January to June amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% from the amount of $5,143,312 in the same period the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State Government reports investments of P17 280 million per year, mainly in enterprises in the service sector.
The debt
In connection with the downturn scenario, the state government asked the state congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy.
Reactions
According to business representatives, the first year of the government of Maria López Valdés showed a lack of governmental management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, stated that in 2011 there was a lack of coordination between the will of the individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The economic development in Sinaloa has been really small this year. We have to work intensively to recover the land that we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double the effort, there was a lack of harmonization of the efforts of all of us and especially the proper and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better", he said.
Slowdown in the economy
Loredo López said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year had halted the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including the cold. One of the main consequences was the slowdown in the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain the momentum needed to achieve acceptable levels of movement of processes, products and services.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Mexican Employers in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"We think that we need to prepare a long-term plan that redefines the goals and economic direction of the state, because it is important to mobilize all the potential material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The Work That lies ahead
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of setting a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
"Generally, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy management.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is trying to be friendly, I can say that there is work done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us", he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and fined 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office has informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of the crime of endangering health, specifically, possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican military units on 7 June 2010 during a march in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in the El Castillo district of Navolato.
The dealer was driving a white pickup truck, had a black bag in the trunk, and a small backpack in the passenger seat, and the soldiers found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detained man has remained at the disposal of the Second Chamber Judge and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of Criminal Law.
Debt on projects
Social projects under programmes such as Habitat, Save Public Places and 3×1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of being delayed by lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of urban social development said that if construction work has progressed so far, the state government now risks not being able to provide the necessary supplies, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state is responsible for 25%.
"It is almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we have received nothing, even though we should have received a portion in July", he said. "To save time, we have started projects and are continuing very successfully, but we lack the money".
He stated that the state had not fulfilled the relevant deliveries during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla last year, and therefore at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to be able to repay more than 7 million that the state administration did not give them.
"The same thing happened to us in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programmes went on.
Despite promises by the State authorities regarding the transfer of these resources, he stated that a request was sent to Armando Villarreal, Secretary for Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
"We were supposed to get 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven't received a single peso yet".
The Court approves 'end of analogue broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected a constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against a presidential decree that seeks to expedite the so-called "analogue signal shutdown" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree that outlines the individual steps that will lead to the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed on the ground that the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which therefore remains in force, had not been reached.
The draft judgment prepared by Minister Olgou Sánchez Cordero proposes the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, since the regulation of all issues relating to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), thus violating the principles of hierarchical subordination and exception to the law.
The only people who voted for the project were Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to fight the decree.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the complaint lodged by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in the hands of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he did not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I don't think even if it did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, recalling that public policy planning in strategic areas like the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has seen in recent years, involving better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying change would be to delay the benefits of digitalisation, which requires decisions in the public interest, as digitalisation has not only a technical dimension but "also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
He stressed that these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic orientation of the state.
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition and had done so through their governments, despite having highly specialised technical bodies.
He stated that it was not possible for the government to introduce into the administration the observance of laws prepared by the legislature by issuing a dissenting decree that to some extent interfered with the sphere of powers of Congress.
The Michoacan is analyzing the possibility of a vote-by-vote count.
According to the PREP data, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is less than 27 percent.
The option of "vote by vote" has emerged in this year's election in Michoacán, where according to the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and 879 of the total 6074 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a series of measures that should harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoacán has not officially ratified its political constitution nor its State Electoral Code or Electoral Justice Act, as the state Congress passed the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this election season and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their publication by the deadline set in the Official State Gazette Act, citing objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) settled a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature, declaring the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it has no right "neither to approve nor to veto".
When asked about the possibility of a 'vote by vote' count, María de los Ángeles Llanderal replied that, with the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM, it would be possible for the partial and the total count to be carried out by the local electoral authority.
In this way, a partial count of votes, one or more ballots, will be possible if the following conditions are met: the election results are not consistent; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or it is not available to the chairperson concerned; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of the election results.
In addition, a total recount of votes at all polling stations will be possible where there is evidence to suggest that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever there is an explicit request at the beginning of the session from the representative of the party and/or coalition that has proposed the candidate in second place.
A total recount of votes will also be possible if, after a proper count, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and whenever there is an explicit request from the political party whose candidate finished in second place, in which case the ballots for which a partial count has been carried out will be discarded.
It should be mentioned that this is the case in the elections in Morelia, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is less than 0,16%, even though 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, his family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported to Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, with a solemn ceremony and a funeral mass to be held on Monday.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After being honored along with the other victims of the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane, where family and close friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel in the Nazario Ortiz Garza classroom, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell party was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member during his graduation.
"He wanted to return to Saltilla and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains, as he always told his family and friends", said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
She said the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his wishes, was at the peak of his life, "was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother who lived for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young and entered the flying school Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe it because they said he even drove a truck, yet he always went after his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he had barely arrived in Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, like when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even recalls that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died doing what he loved most in life: flying an airplane.
They said goodbye to him
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we bid farewell to all the honors that have come to him from Governor Jorge Torres López, the citizens and the state government, the Mexican Army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and where he excelled both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died in the past few days after the helicopter he was piloting crashed, with the Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora on board, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be delivered by funeral service to the Mexican Air Force under the command of Major Jaime Martinez, at a plaza where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers were gathered.
Three abandoned bodies found on Cadereyta NL estate.
Hours before the discovery, military officials introduced to the media 11 individuals who had been detained in the area for organized crime-related crimes.
The bodies of three men murdered by gunshot to various parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned estate in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery was made on a mile of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the beige-caffeinated hut had its door open from time to time.
When they looked inside from about ten feet away, they noticed three dead bodies, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One person was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing a baton, and next to him was a man in a white striped sports shirt.
A few yards away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three lay face down.
According to the information obtained at the scene, all three people were probably murdered in a different location, as no bullets were found.
There were messages on the walls of the cabins addressed to one organized crime group and another, as well as a series of bullet marks, both on the building and on the door.
Cadereyt has 11 suspects in custody.
The Secretary of National Defence has identified 11 individuals, including juveniles, who were members of a criminal group that operated primarily in the Cadereita area and is linked to kidnappings, murders, stalking and illegal burials.
According to the information released, during the first attempt on 11 November in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were detained and one detained person was released.
Three properties and a cell phone have been seized, confirming they're members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another raid occurred at 6 a.m. on November 12th, when military personnel were patrolling the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta when they spotted two people in an unmarked car.
After the car was stopped, they did a search and found one rifle, a casing and 18 rounds.
Then, based on these statements, around 2pm on November 13th, one of the accomplices was arrested in the La Frauda area, and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
On Wednesday , the new Italian government will be appointed .
Prime Minister-elect Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping this country above the precipice of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-elect Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that is keeping the country above the brink of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a statement announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to introduce a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with the political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked", he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, while Italy struggles to cope with a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt levels to unsustainable levels.
The new administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders, the only way to restore Italy's shattered credibility.
There's a lot of pressure on Monti to hurry, because of the volatility of the markets, the interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity have exceeded the 7 percent threshold, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers' organization Confindustria, told reporters after meeting with Monti: "We said we would be very supportive of this government".
We believe that this government is the last chance to get Italy out of this burning situation.
Monti's hopes of success have been greatly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday by the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to produce good results", Angelina Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government with a technocratic majority, which is composed of Monti.
Support for the Parliament
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to push through unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in this effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure, warning that Monti's failure could spell disaster.
Monti opened talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organisations.
The round of talks will end Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitan, which allowed a very rapid process in response to the crisis.
After a brief fall at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields have returned to the critical level, reacting to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
The rescue of Italy, whose public debt is €1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the current euro area financial reserves.
Monti has stated that his government should remain in power until the next elections scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that he says politicians will only give him time to implement reforms and then call early elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this government must be composed only of experts to lift Italy out of the trouble the country has been in due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that the bilateral mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicates the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards attend international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish players, 10 will exceed the limit of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players called up reached the 50-game mark.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, when we compare the 22 players from both countries who gathered for a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the World and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a wide range of A-level inter-county matches to their credit, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who is the only one to have played 50 international matches.
He achieved this on Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at Rommel Fernández Stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the All-Star Game and for the powerful clubs of the English Premier League, maintain intense activity throughout the year in league championships and domestic cups and high-level European cup competitions such as the Champions League.
To the former we must add the experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated qualifying matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities to play international matches in the region, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the most international matches of the Spanish national team are played by goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who last Saturday beat former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta in England (losing 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Costa Rica today, and will set a new record for Spain with 127 international appearances.
Xavi Hernandez, Barcelona's key player, has 106 games to his name.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially ruled out by UEFA last week, along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches to their name, including the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke midfielder Raúl González with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with [Fernando Torres at 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both at 81; Andrés Iniesta at 62; Cesc Fábregas at 61; and David Silva at 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman, left wing Junior Díaz moves on with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Only five other teams have reached the 30-match mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, they are represented by Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 matches, Roy Miller is 26, Winston Parks is 26, Gabriel Badilla is 25 and Roy Myrie is 23.
The rest of them didn't even make it past 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet has included the country in their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary
"The trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to play one of the best shows in the nation next Sunday at the National Stadium.
We've been waiting for over 20 years, but the band themselves assures us that for them, the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The band is on a tour of South America to celebrate its 20th anniversary and will make a one-off stopover in Central America on Sunday the 20th.
He's performing at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. tonight with the angel band The X and the national musicians of Las Robertas.
This is a sample of the interview, the full transcript of which can be found on the website of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true, Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica, do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The Costa Rica trip is also our dream come true.
We've only been to South and Central America twice, and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I hope we can stay here for a few days.
So we're very excited to bring our music to you.
I'm asking because they literally love the band here, and the fans are having these days of preparation very intense.
What do you say to your most rocky supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, and we thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long.
Some people are already talking about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that put you under more pressure?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have come within weeks of each other.
We've done some great shows in Sao Paulo, and we're hoping that it'll get us in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to the concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle, and for both of those things, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you know Costa Rica and its waves were suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico, and those are the best places to surf, and that's how we learned about Costa Rica from people who love surfing.
Looking at your tour, you've put on a great show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, there's no limit to what we can do.
We're gonna try to put on the best show we can with the most diverse music, and we're gonna try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think part of it is because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs we're going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played in a long time, we focus on them and we're also surprised, because we remember why we liked them so much and that we might have forgotten about them.
That's why the show is more interesting to us, and I think it's more interesting to people.
This tour is to celebrate 20 years of your artistic career.
Looking back, it's hard to believe all you've accomplished?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think either of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd be in it for over 20 years.
We realize how much power we've been given and it's touching that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We're lucky to be able to see the places we've always wanted to see.
We couldn't have done it better.
What did it mean to you to be a major part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group, where the greats are all represented.
The people at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It's surprising that when a movement starts from a group of friends, it doesn't happen very often.
From time to time a group will form in a city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to appear from one city at a time.
We're proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them sometimes.
Last year, we were at the Alice in Chains festival, and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Soundgarden on tour, and we're lucky that they're all our friends, and we're honored to be able to be part of this movement that started in Seattle.
It's also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a lot longer than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first, we're all lucky to still be in this world, and second, it's the fact that we're always interested in each other.
We're all close friends, and that's how we've been able to open up musical avenues that leave everyone with enough freedom to experiment on their own.
We trust each other, we respect each other's music, and I think it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you can do whatever you want.
How do you find the balance?
As we grew older, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it's very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people come for music, you remember that you have to respect music and what you've given it, you can't get carried away by being famous, rock stars, which none of us ever really cared about.
What do you remember about the next Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and it was something great at the beginning.
We'd been around as a band for three years and we never released an album until after Andy [Andrew Woods] died.
It was very frustrating because it took so long, and the most important thing is that we're still friends with Bruce and Greg, who started with us in the band, and when I listen to a song or look at a picture, I remember Andy, how incredible he was, how I laughed with him, and it was always a pleasure to work with him, to laugh with him, to talk about music or football and so on.
She was an incredible person and we miss her so much.
The National Band of Las Robertas will be commissioned to open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production company sent us videos with some designs, and this group was the one we liked the most, so we're curious what Las Robertas are going to offer live, and they have to be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Eddie, so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he adds the first thing he thinks.
Who influences you as a bass player?
A lot of people.
The first people I'm attacked by are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There's so many I could talk all night about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam keep grunge going when it's not in fashion anymore?
I think we've all always felt slightly detached from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I think of bands that I've mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other bands that came out around the same time, and if the music is still that good, it's great because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are playing better music today than ever before.
Your music was a little gloomy at first, but now it's more positive.
What is behind this change?
That's interesting because I feel like there are a few songs on the new album that are a little bit more light-hearted, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they can sound positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them to me, I cried, and they're deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and you have some trauma in your life, you lose a family member or a friend, these things start to affect your art and your music, and these two songs are just that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.

Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a state hospital for tests of muscle loss in his lower limbs, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four surgeries and is currently under medical supervision.
MP Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television station that Fujimori will undergo tests in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds, however the former president himself does not wish to be pardoned because he feels innocent.
He had four operations for tongue cancer, lost 60 pounds [18 kg], and was beset by other ailments, including severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in his pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and circulatory problems in his legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by an army killing squad operating illegally in the early years of his rule.
Mujica on a visit to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday, aiming to expand trade between the two nations and to touch on political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, on Wednesday, the most important meeting of a large-scale visit, including meetings with politicians, business leaders and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico, the program was released by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries", the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media reports, Mujica will try to get Calderón to back Uruguay in a dispute with France that occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a tax haven list at the G20 summit in Cannes, France.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude countries that continued to maintain their tax havens from the international community, a statement that prompted a negative opinion from Uruguay and consultation with the European country's ambassador.
Mexico has been the G20's president since November, a group of the world's most powerful developing and developed countries that have signed an information-sharing agreement with the Latin American country since January to prevent double taxation.
The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was signed on 15 March and entered into force on 1 January.
In trade terms, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has increased trade in goods between the two countries.
The bearded plumber is running in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land".
For over 25 years, Super Mario has fought tirelessly to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land", he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores around the world this month, was designed from the ground up to take advantage of all the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows you to play 3D games without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to tell you how to do stereoscopy without glasses", said Nintendo's Spanish press officer Omar Álvarez during a presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium", because up until this point successful films like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson stated that in addition to being 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "available" video game that allows for fast and smooth gameplay.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you've passed this level, you can proceed to "round two" on levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real-time between "aggressive D" or similar, which only affects the depth of the action, but will need to play in 3D to overcome various challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This new entry in Super Maria 3D also involves the return of the character to a portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes of the audience, repeating the successful formula of the previous games, in which the bearded man's plumber must go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds new moves, surroundings, disguises and enemies, the "playful" Luigi also appears.
Colom has approved the extradition of Portillo to the United States.
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he has taken steps to extradite former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held in the United States for conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
This ends a process that was intended to get Guatemala to respond to a request from a northern country that was demanding Portillo's extradition so that it could prosecute him.
At the press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was in line with the independence of the judiciary and the executive and that he recalled that the extradition had already been ordered by the criminal court.
He assured that during his tenure he had "not interfered" with court decisions and authorised all issues that came to his table.
In addition to Portilla, we're going to extradite Sergio Ruano Marroquin for murder and grievous bodily harm and Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Coloma's move is a step of execution after all the judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the former president who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded the release, but the Attorney General appealed, putting the case back in play.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people in distress
The organization was created to help children without education not to feel marginalized.
The record of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people who were threatened with social exclusion were helped.
This is in addition to the hundreds of jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday's anniversary also served to present the balance sheets in a ceremony held in the former Fabra i Coats factory premises, attended by more than 300 people.
The Trinijove organisation was set up in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, unemployment, drug addiction or in a situation where they could be socially excluded.
Yesterday's meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organisations and institutions which have worked with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Triniyev.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Maas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujo, the ceremony was attended by the former Socialist Education Councillor, Ernest Maragall, and the former Deputy Mayor and current Ecological Socialist Councillor, Ricard Goma.
The present Adviser for Social Welfare and the Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also arrived in the Fabra i Coats Hall.
Mas said that Trinijove was founded in a very difficult time and that the present time also encounters a number of obstacles, but he added that the work the association has brought to date "is a good foundation".
The President cited Triniov as an example of how to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and the work it does", he said.
The house was evacuated, where huge parties were held.
Intruders have taken 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes.
12 occupants left the house yesterday at noon without resistance
All indications are that the nightmare that the neighbors of 51 Balmes Street were living through is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they were staying illegally and where they were hosting a giant party that the neighbors were building, by court order and without the intervention of the police.
After the operation, the door lock was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded", declared the warden.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are occupied - took away all electrical and partial water equipment, painted the walls, and left behind all kinds of waste, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the site of huge parties that lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that during the time the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque points out that the occupants of the building were unfair competition to her because they sold drinks for 3 euros, whereas the disco costs 10.
The owner of the entertainment business also had to respond to complaints from neighbors about noise, but the problem was not with the disco patrons, but with the occupants of the house and especially those who attended the parties, which have increased in frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to angry residents.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even made a deal with the building's owner, who has been removing her rent for nine months.
The city police also confirmed that they have received several complaints from neighbors over the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the city's PP group in the city hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, last week demanded that "the building be evacuated immediately, thus ending the problems of civic coexistence that the neighbors are suffering and the destruction of the area".
The chairman of the People's Party explained that only one floor was taken last summer, but in recent months the occupants have been able to get into all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there was even a theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civic responsibility that have occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at building 35 on Mont-Ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects have come together to write a lawsuit that involves more than just a controversy over fees.
The city's 16-door competition reopens the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the boom of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the municipality published several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large park in metropolitan Barcelona.
What's more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York's Central Park.
After the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper boundary of Barcelona, one of the few cities in Catalonia that is not oriented on a north-south axis but up (up) - down (down) (sea).
The qualification of Collserol as a nature reserve is in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the wild boars instead of Yogi Bear.
That was the position until September, when the city council announced a mega-competition of 16 bids for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records more of the park's idea.
Either that, or someone's trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question is, Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organisational point of view and on the basis of reflection on the city, this question becomes a central theme for all Barcelona architects.
It's as much a subject as when two members of this ancient caste of chosen people join hands in an elevator.
And it was this feat that brought about one of the rare coincidences between what the three Barcelona architects thought and the previous university professors.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure has its reasons.
According to Roldan, after the Gulf side question was raised, the "mountain side" also "needs" to be discussed, so the speech by Ildefonso Cerdo on the green apples was not finished.
"We must start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's very accessible.
Collserola is more complex", said the architect, for whom the name "Gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not think of them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona, with experience in the world of urban planning, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" with "certain dangers".
The danger stems from the "uncertainty of the public space project today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had its swan song in the Forum area.
The first concern is the very definition of where to build.
"To define something is to take the next step", that is, to move one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban planning tools, because the current ones (referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster".
If we look more closely at the question, Modol considers that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered a park", but the Barcelona part cannot, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work being done by Patronat de Collserola which "must not end up in the garbage dump", although he welcomed the fact that the City Council offers his committee to intervene in the project from the "first moment".
And furthermore, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a sort of pass that allows architects to engage in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be this very technical profile that leads to multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should be just tools".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the game its name is complex, because the selection criteria lack Collserole's global vision: "There have been 16 competitions that cover all the mountain-sea axis, but there is no longitudinal study that looks at the area and understands it as a whole".
That makes him, at least, a candidate for all 16 contests.
Otherwise, the design of one gate may conflict with the concept and definition of the architect of the neighbouring gate.
In his view, the City should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt provides facilities throughout the zone to ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino has pardoned Jonas Larrazabaal, who will be released
After 72 days of detention, the legal representative of Cadino Red granted clemency to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged extortion.
Manuel Jonas Larrazábal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being granted clemency by the legal representative of Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court of the same district, which was hearing a blackmail case against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás was supposed to ask him to pay an economic quota to the city of Monterrey to allow the illegal operation of the gambling house.
After a public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal investigation against the brother of the Panist mayor.
Then after four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office's Property Offences Agent Number 3, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained at this location for the next 49 days after the second arrest warrant was issued and a prosecutor ruled out complicity or organized crime.
On October 19, he was taken to the Cadereita Criminal Court on suspicion of extorting the owners of the Casino Red for one and a half million pesos, however he only remained a few hours in a medium-security prison because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to stay in the city cells in San Nicolás de los Garza during the trial.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been gathered to prove Jonas' guilt, including the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise to allow the operation.
This Monday, the legal representative of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecino and requested a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released soon.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's representative assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez whether the damages had been repaired and which of the partners had decided to grant clemency, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
According to Official Record 197/2011, Jonas Larrazabaal is granted a legal pardon, no appeal can be lodged in the proceedings against him, no claim for damages or punishment can be made.
After a hearing with the legal representative at about 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larrazabel Breton.
The court clerk, Jorge Yanéz, arrived at the prison in the city of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been granted a formal pardon and that his case had been put on hold.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome presented details of the plane crash that killed the governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) has informed that the results of the investigation into the accident that killed Prime Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people show that the helicopter hit the ground at full power without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said that before the plane took off, the pilot stated that the weather conditions allowed the flight.
"The parts that appear suggest that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, wings entangled in the branches of trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the hull".
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 persons and therefore met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
Furthermore, he stated that based on the investigation carried out in the impact area, no components were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that the parts of the plane were not located anywhere else, so the plane hit the mainland intact.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, met all requirements for the transport of people.
The terrain is sloping from seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at this time, the most important thing is to get results as soon as possible, although the investigation could take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, stated that at the time of the crash, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was traveling at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascent terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident this was a routine overflight operation", he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez Jácome identified six key points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was operated in accordance with visual flight rules, i.e. the crew must be able to see the ground during the flight.
Weather conditions:
Reports from the AICM indicate adequate conditions at take-off, according to which the aircraft is heading towards the border, between DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Routes selected:
It is likely that the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca Valley because of the clouds.
Location of impact.
The collision coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter match, it's likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight path before the collision.
Dispersal of aircraft debris in restricted areas:
The information we have at present allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The scattered plane debris diagram indicates that the helicopter was intact at the time of impact.
No fire or explosion was recorded.
There was no evidence of an explosion or fire at the scene.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During fieldwork, the remains of the plane were found at an altitude of up to 9200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the slope ranges from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show footage of what is likely to have been a breakdown along the route.
The information provides elements that seem to suggest that the helicopter may have made contact with the ground at several locations.
After a thorough search of the accident area, which is larger than the designated area, no remains of the helicopter were found, reinforcing the assumption that the collision occurred when the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Health Insurance Institute has begun research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance is conducting research to discover the gene responsible for childhood and adolescent obesity.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to identify the gene that causes obesity in children and adolescents.
In a report, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry at the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists, and social workers had been set up.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without permission, can also participate in the research, and people can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in the Valle de México, where they will be tested every Sunday from 8 a.m. onwards.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity is also being carried out at the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Center (Eastern Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been collected, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Centre (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (north of the Federal Centre).
He explained that the goal of this study was to identify the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people, thus preventing the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from 3,000 children and young people aged between six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels, and genes (to identify genes involved in childhood obesity) are taken of all participants.
Cruz López said that the research reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in childhood weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, obesity increased by 77% in boys and 47% in girls, and there was a dramatic increase in overweight", said an IMSS expert.
He stated that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic makeup, 30% European, and 5% African, reflected in the genes responsible for diabetes and obesity.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn off the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants was that they received an overall assessment of the children's condition, which would determine whether they were known to be overweight or obese.
He stated that even the presence of dark wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that an individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential for now, and doctors give it to the parents in writing, explaining all the measures and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the television all day, and using transportation instead of walking short distances.
Obesity is also caused by high caloric intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content, and genetic burden, which is the subject of this research.
There will be no spillways in the Asphalt of UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM School of Chemistry, creates modified asphalt with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climate and temperature
If the paving were properly maintained, nearly 200,000 excreta would not need to be repaired after each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, noted Rafael Herrera Nájera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, adding that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt paving were adequate, excreta would be significantly reduced or even eliminated.
In his talk on the technological causes of leaks given during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that a laboratory under his direction was developing modified asphalt with polymers, which would produce a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt but with greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, improving functionality and reducing the formation of sloughs.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a group of hydrocarbon molecules, high molecular weight molecules called asphaltene, and low molecular weight molecules called maltene, which together give asphalt its typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost solid, while at low temperatures the asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the strength of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperature, noted a chemical engineering expert.
A scientist at the School of Chemistry observed that most streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible paving, made up of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the topmost layers is an asphalt slab, made up of small stones that are poured into the asphalt and then pressed.
He emphasized that each stone that forms the insert is covered with asphalt.
When cars pass or when pressure is created, it is possible for the forces in the pavement to be well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, they would decompose even better, a chemical engineer believes.
He added that the last layer of asphalt, called the mantle, is made of fine stone, sand, also poured into the asphalt.
As this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have a higher mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must provide for the friction of the road surface.
Since the cladding will be subject to heavy loads, the coat must be of sufficient thickness and care must be taken with the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to be taken into account.
Once the terrain is wet, water spreads inwards and is difficult to get out, softening all the layers of the pavement and creating sloughs.
He explained that the first thing that happens during the process of making the slurry is that the film of the coat is damaged and then the asphalt is damaged, but it is not done all at once, but is a slow process that should be stopped at the first marks with proper maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of slurries, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must correspond to the load of vehicles and must be ensured that this load is not exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there is still a lot of work to be done on asphalt and that research is still in its infancy, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and allow the repair of landfills without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the Valle candidate lack to become the next Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to Melina Ramírez Serna's failure to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle wins his 14th title in his first multi-miss.
Valle del Cauca has once again failed to win the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content with being on the winning podium, winning the silver crown and the sherpa, which made her the new first Miss Colombia.
Based on the results of the previous day's final in Cartagena, which she won and the saddle was taken by Miss Atlántico, the department won the 14th title of the first Miss Universe. Melina joined the ranks of women from Valle del Cauca who were close to the winning crown but were eventually declared first Miss Universe, including Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Romela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel (1993), Giselle Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés (2008).
A question many people ask: What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, who in all previous rounds has shown that she is capable of becoming the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Royal Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took away the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that led the jury to choose to name her only First Miss is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez of the literary edition of Leamos.
The candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe very much in the role of literature, I think it's a form of culture. The book that most influenced me as a child was "The Little Prince", a very profound book.
I'm currently reading "Crime and Punishment", a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know, and I have a book with me today by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author, and it's a wonderful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
This reply was disliked, firstly because of the term 'culturalising' and secondly because the applicant did not explain how the various books mentioned had affected her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and happy with the result: "The world is wise, what is to happen, will happen.
And you people, read if you can.
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorites' position.
The Bogotá journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who took away all the previous awards (the Oster Gastronomic Challenge, the public title for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, stressed the queen, who then burned on stage.
This was evident at the first show of the suit at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was clear that she lacked the strength and passion that the Magdalena and Atlantico representatives had.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for Canal RCN's "Like at Home" programme, believes that Melinda's first ever Miss World title confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not ultimately leave with the Queen's crown".
And Valle has been rather rude to the media in recent days, and it hasn't paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Pageant.
Just in case, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who would be aware of the social needs of her country.
"In the Miss Colombia pageant, beauty alone is not enough, you need to see something more than just physical beauty. You need to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before they enter the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle lost points due to her background defects and fibrosis that was visible on her buttocks, but this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her as Miss "Natural Beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hernán Orozco, who prepares queens, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis of the buttocks, which in my opinion were not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day".
Meanwhile, Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the Valle woman made a mistake by undergoing several surgeries.
"The surgeries are fine, but they didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong point, and here she took her toll".
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Beauty Society, after the swimsuit parade, a cruel prediction came true, claiming that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo had given Melina, so that he would not have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether true or not, it is certain that today Melina began the year of her reign, not as queen, but as princess, from a position that allows her to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming success at Cartagena, failed to reach the highest crown.
That was the work of the Cali resident who identified the body of Alfonso Cana
The Cali fingerprint expert went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cana".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4th, last year, a fingerprint expert from CTI in Cali made history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC's top leader, "Alfonse Cana", by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working in the CTI department, this week's turn was to Eliazar González, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in the field of forensic research for 21 years.
Early in his career, González worked at the city hall in Chocó, where he often had to wade through the forest for more than five days to reach the location of the bodies that needed identification.
In 2000, he moved to the capital city of Valle, and after taking the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprinting, a science that studies skin friction, that is, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.
During the week of the operation on the aforementioned Alfonso Can, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was coming.
He left for Cauca on Friday night in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew he would have to identify two bodies, and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla warfare in the world, so they asked him to take a card with fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigative team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it because of the physical appearance.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a villager in the area, no glasses, much slimmer.
But the prints don't lie.
With a galloon magnifier, ink, and a transplant, and light, Elias began to compare the dead man's fingerprints with the notes on the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man originally from Puerto Tejada was assigned to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to confirm that he was indeed the FARC's top commander.
Searching for clues
For the Sijín de Cali fingerprint, the recognition given to Eliazar González by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the anti-Cano operations service is very significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, without the possibility of error, that can play a key role in deciding criminal offenses.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help in the investigation of crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When they get caught, a lot of delinquents present false IDs or no IDs at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of the injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house, because this was where the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not designed for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get a fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts", he recalled.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove a murder suspect.
They found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
The investigation revealed that a family member could be responsible for the murder, and the print on the bottle did confirm it.
Although it cannot be confirmed 100% that he was indeed the killer, it is clear that he appeared at the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that the items are "printed using chemical or physical reagents".
When they do, a transplant or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the offender database, or the registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data are not recorded anywhere", said a CTI expert.
He explained that not everything is as it is shown on CSI.
Like everything that glows, it's not gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, appropriate comparisons must be made.
"Outraged" protest in New York City
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they were to camp.
A large number of them were waiting for the order to evacuate the area and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York City officials on Tuesday as they tried to retake Manhattan Square, where they were evicted this morning, by court order, and then attempted to seize another New York City park.
Hundreds of protesters have been rallying in Zuccotti Square, where they were seeking to get through a court order allowing "indignant" people to return to camp, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle elsewhere and continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, both through rallies and peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street.
Bray said the "outraged" response to the camp's eviction order by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself went all the way to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evictions and allowing protesters to continue camping.
In addition to the "outcry", they also took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish property at Trinity Church.
They managed to take the place for at least an hour, but then the police came and detained some of the protesters.
The organization says that several hundred people have settled in the area, and a delegation of religious leaders has come to express support and to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of the early morning evacuation will be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed copies of the warrants and even gave them to the officials guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", said Bray, who condemned the fact that some police beat protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting Occupy Wall Street members or using "laws that were published after the shooting began, or prohibiting protesters from entering the park with shops or other places they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order the city has suspended the reopening of public spaces and warned the protesters that local laws do not allow them to return to tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the early morning evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which 200 people were detained and arrested because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it was becoming "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others", because "some businesses received threatening letters" and "neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives".
"The early eviction was appalling and shows Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people", added a spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "disregarding freedom of expression".
Occupy Wall Street also said it planned to hold "big events" Thursday in partnership with community and union organizations to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be playing the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on Home Improvement, a swimmer on Baywatch, a bunny on Playboy, the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee, and now an actress and model who will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television station CTV announced today that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, and will be the incarnation of the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from Internet home pornography, appears with her ex-husband, "Mötley Crüe" motorcycle racer Tommy Lee, as Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a crib.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, who recently hosted Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, will appear on stage.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special will feature Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March, and who is close to controversy.
Bublé recently called Kim Kardashian, an American, a "fox" at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Revives After a Destructive Earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of decline that began in March
Since March of last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300,000,000, a wound that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of falling, GDP reached a position between July and September where it was possible to turn the page once and for all: GDP grew by 1.5% compared with the previous quarter and by 6% per annum.
Moreover, the results of the second quarter - the Japanese tax year starts in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery can be partly explained by the purchase of machinery needed to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% compared to January-March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse to use the crisis to get out of it stronger or to rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has awakened, mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, due to increased expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma of the yeast
Flow has been entrusted to the internal market as the yen, the Japanese currency, has become one of the "life-saving assets" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the worrying US forecasts, a privilege that is also a major burden on exporting firms.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of big tech groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, attributed their weak performance in July to September to the yen.
While markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government is cautious.
"We must be wary of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid rise of the yen", said Motohisa Furukawa, State Secretary for Economic Policy, yesterday.
And the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has specified that most Member States showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economies of the major powers are slowing.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area even fell below the average of 100, reaching a level of 99.13 points.
Athens again spreads uncertainty
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments.
With its fast and risky marginal guarantees and the uncertainty that has reigned, Greece is increasingly entangled in the maze that leads to the exit from the great debt crisis in Europe.
The notion that the "agreement" of the new Greek transitional government is based on the demands of Brussels rather than on the real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday admitted that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100 days he was given when he was appointed are likely to be short for their implementation, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, said that the new austerity measures would not be supported in any way and reiterated his demand for new elections to be held on the expected date of February 19.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the summit of 26 October", Papadimos said yesterday during the parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow in a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, the message from Samaras leaves no doubt about his position: "We have committed to help the interim government, but we have not committed to anything else".
The Conservative leader went a bit too far in his speech to the EU and the IMF, which are supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but he also said that he would not support or sign any commitments to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angered by the impact of the Papandreou referendum, yesterday stressed that its demands were insuperable: it would not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties signed "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" and negotiate with the new government "what it needs to pay the sixth part" of the $8 billion, but there is no definitive date.
The Greek bride has a little time to make up for.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's privileged position in relation to this type of financing
Spain 'has achieved a significant position on the global microfinance scene'.
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second donor to the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, which is essentially "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity.
The Queen opened the 5th Global Micro-Loan Summit in Valladolid yesterday, saying that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "completely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the UN by 2015. "In particular, it is about meeting the goals to halve the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the amount that sets the poverty line".
Spain "will continue to work" and expand its network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", underlined Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and the contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to whom the loans are primarily intended.
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges remain".
The Micro-Loan Summit is intended to be not only a forum for discussion but also a platform to support the 'core objectives'.
Her Majesty explained that the aim is to have 175 million poor families have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and to have 100 million families rise above the poverty line they currently live below.
The concept of micro-loans spread to Spain and other countries around the world after "the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, set out on this journey", the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and due recognition".
She described the father of the instrument as "an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to fight poverty", and she had come across his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to see first-hand his lending policies.
This experience was followed by others, such as the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings such as the 1999 Ivory Coast, Canada, in 2006. "I have seen a steady progress at all these meetings", explained the Queen, who yesterday earned the title of "head of the family" from the Poor People's Movement in Valladolid for her support of the project.
Queen Sophia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and find solutions to enable the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, declared that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this context, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with the period of ballot-busting, since such cooperation is a 'permanent obligation'.
Jiménez believes that micro-loans represent "a serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and that now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become the victim of cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed the success, which celebrates the concept of giving trust to people to whom everyone else closes the door.The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the participants in a city that "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect a European President on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November was without serious difficulties for Chancellor Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The question of the future of Europe was not on the agenda at first, but it did not become one until the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the management was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1,001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
The few minutes of standing ovations at the end of Angela Merkel's speech and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The Chancellor's main idea and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: "Not less Europe, but more Europe" in response to the crisis.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
The chancellor of Europe said that "it is time for change".
This could be reflected in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage 'to give Europe a single face'.
That is at least one of the ideas in the draft adopted by the congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is unlikely that all 27 countries will agree on this revolutionary step quickly: Britain is opposed and the CDU leaders think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is marked.
Likewise, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to rate each country's weight on the European Central Bank's board of directors according to the weight of its economy, which would obviously result in Germany's weight being increased.
Driven by a concern to calm the mood within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not try to get the congress to talk about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the European proposal has a paragraph on the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just 200 years ago a bloody battle was fought near Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is incapacity fraud?
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government launch an offensive against disability.
On Tuesday 15 December, Mr Sarkozy will visit the Social Assistance Office in Bordeaux, where he will deliver a speech on the theme of combating social fraud and redistribution of solidarity, a theme that has been repeated since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on disability.
First, for budgetary reasons, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity on private sector employees before they start receiving sickness benefit.
Clearly, without the company's consent, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, or at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by another measure of symbolic significance: giving public employees one day of unpaid incapacity (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are being discussed, the right-wing majority is also launching a fraud theme, this time focusing on the evils associated with disability.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return", Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of notification seem somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the injustices of incapacity for work.
These have in fact been the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002 and political pressure which has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's stop at a few official numbers first.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), the national health insurance agency, more than EUR 237 million in daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily allowances amounted to EUR 11.3 billion in 2008, representing 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity benefits and accidents at work and 54% for incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6,2 billion.
That's only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, the French had an average of 14,5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, compared with 17,8 days in 2009.
The average is somewhat different: another survey published in 2007 on the job site Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not chosen a day of incapacity.
Another study, this time by the health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37,8% of incapacities were less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% lasted longer.
Compared with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to disability than elsewhere.
A long-term study carried out in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 total absences (whether for health reasons or not) ranged from 10% to 11.8% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Injuries cheating is only a very small part of the work done under the black.
As far as the frauds go, they're only on a small scale.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in systematic checks targeting incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that of the 1.5 million checks carried out, 13,8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term disabilities were 'unjustified or too long', i.e. 37 050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities of more than 45 days, 11% of the cases were 'unaccustomed or unjustified' out of 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
This amounts to 169 000 'illegal' cases per several million workers who were incapacitated.
A number that's much less than the number for work in black.
According to Dominique Tiana, a member of the UMP who authored a June report on the issue, this figure would represent between EUR 9 and 15 billion missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily allowances and thus infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to restore its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos made these words in parliament on Monday, December 14, adding that 100 days given to his unity government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"To get our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new bailout", the prime minister said as he delivered his first public speech at the start of the confidence vote debate in parliament on Wednesday.
He said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October summit would be the "main task" of the new government, because the country's participation in the euro area was at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would now be "around 9%" of gross domestic product by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday expressed his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but pointed out that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures", Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs from his New Democracy party.
We agreed on targets for deficit and debt reduction and the fight against waste, but we are against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized, says expert panel
According to a report by the Royal Society of Canada, Canadians are denied death.
On palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives on the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the possibility of talking to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make decisions accordingly.
That is one of the conclusions of a large-scale report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this option appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
The experts begin by quoting a recent survey by the independent Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada came in 10th, the study notes that "medicalisation of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death".
Medicalisation or not, 77% of Canadians don't have access to palliative care, experts with a Royal Society of Canada mandate tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This is the average across Canada, while the province of Quebec has the highest rate, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach conclusions that contradict the position of the federal government, which has already said it does not want to change the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal offence, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on incompetent or non-compliant persons.
In contrast, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday that there are more than a dozen cases of such seizures in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favor of euthanasia
Recall that according to a 2010 Angus Reid Forum survey, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia, believing it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia won't mean we're sending a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who practice assisted suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear on whether to maintain or discontinue patient care, the report's authors say.
They also propose that in criminal law, a refusal to treat for which there is a legally valid refusal is not a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requires that medical professionals be trained to respect the duty to refuse treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
On palliative care, the Commission urges governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cases of cancer.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care facilities, the Commission requests that it be considered as euthanasia once it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, specialist in medical law, described the position of the experts-signatories of the report as 'extreme' partly because it does not restrict the practice of euthanasia to the terminally ill.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years of age could ask for help to commit suicide", says Pierre Deschamps, who studied the summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also points out that it seems that the authors of the report place the autonomy of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
Because "in society, he says, there are warning signs and limitations".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she described as a 'manifesto for euthanasia'.
Margaret Somerville, a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, is particularly skeptical of the report's data on the absence of error in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and the U.S. state of Oregon.
Jordan's king calls on President Assad to resign
Damascus is talking about a "conspiracy".
Syria is becoming more isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters demonstrated outside the Foreign Ministry yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syria from President Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting and speaks of a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after suspending Syria's membership in the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbors, have taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab ruler to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "transfer power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that the efforts of Turkish mediation with the Syrian regime undertaken since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is increasingly taking a hard line.
The United States welcomed the "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the dishonest behavior of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are increasingly taking a tougher tone" to the repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that during this period, 16 civilians and 19 pro-regime forces were killed in the southern city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed "in a firefight and concentrated heavy machine gun fire in Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "on the way out of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from membership, which he described as a 'dangerous step'.
Syria "will not bow", he added, assuring that "plots against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the Arab League is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favours the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he says is behaving 'paranoidly'.
A new special meeting of the League is being convened in Rabat tomorrow to take a position on the resolution plan agreed on 2 December, which included the withdrawal of troops from the cities beset by conflict and the release of imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "wrong", while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
The following table is added:
Monti demands time and sacrifice after the Italians
The next Italian prime minister, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a programme that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner discussed with the political parties yesterday before meeting with trade union and employers' representatives today.
He should form a relatively thin cabinet made up of technocrats from outside the parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke of an important agenda with many victims", said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the prime minister-designate.
The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
In a 'democracy with precise deadlines' for preparing the government and its programme, he stressed, adding that he was 'certain that the markets will be patient and understanding'.
His appointment as president was initially well received by the markets, but concerns re-emerged after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate should set up a team mainly comprising technocrats, although he has stressed that he would like to include 'politicians' in the team.
He expressed his belief that the new government would last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the confidence of the parliament by Friday.
Mario Monti, on taking office, promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy a "strong link" of Europe.
Spokesman for the European Commissioner, Olli Rehn, stressed that 'even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change'.
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its target of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Emma Marcegagli, head of the Confindustria business union, who will meet with Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth cannot meet deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) renowned for his expertise and independence, the 'professor', which the editors describe as a 'challenge to seriousness' and a 'different Italy', represents an 'epocal change' for Italy after 17 years of 'Berlusconism'.
The great unknown will be the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must deposit €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator capable of being used for a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks reported Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is relying on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the ISIS Institute, which draws extensively on IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to have worked for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to have been engaged in the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the centre to set up a "nano-diamond" manufacturing company in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company should have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He was then supposed to work on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls 'clear evidence that the development of the detonation system by Iran' was based 'on the work of a foreign specialist who not only was well versed in the method but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked for a substantial part of his working career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin'.
Anti-Muslim crimes and offenses increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released Monday, the number of crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased slightly or increased little during the same time.
According to these figures, the total number of violent crimes against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, a 49% increase compared to a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in offences against Jews and a 14% increase in overall anti-religious crimes and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and offences rise again", Human Rights First stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant", the organization added in its statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
"The American government can and must do more to deal with these atrocities", he adds, estimating that this could be done by improving police reporting on "hate crimes".
"Hate crime" under U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights era.
This legal order was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence based on race, color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and becoming more like Facebook
Microblogging site Twitter on Monday introduced a design change to allow users to monitor followers' activity, somewhat resembling its Facebook service.
The new activity and name tabs allow you to better and directly know the activity of other people who follow you or whose replies ("tweets") you follow.
This allows you to know if they allow you to track posts, if they sign up for new accounts, if they have favourite posts, etc.
The new Twitter face was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before being rolled out across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its less instinctive functioning, with somewhat incomprehensible terms (RT for repeatedly sharing someone else's post, followfriday for recommending to follow another user) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
Users on the net immediately differ in their "tweets" on the importance of this innovation.
"It's useless, it takes up a lot of space and it's too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"Activity will help me better track some elements of my Twitter", tweeted @dannykronstrom.
The following table is added:
The Golden Rule on Balanced Budgeting
The Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, the ruling grand coalition government in Austria, decided on Tuesday to insert a "golden rule" of fiscal policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a case of Austria being downgraded by the rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, at a time when Austria's public debt, at 74.6%, is well above the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more in interest every year", argued Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria thus follows up on the request of the Euro Area Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State or Government strongly requested that the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of the public accounts be enshrined in the Constitution or the Law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the 'German model', Germany being the first European country to adopt such a 'rule'.
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to be reduced by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the Länder, as well as the municipalities, will have to report balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion set out in the Maastricht Treaty by the 2020/21 horizon.
♪ Strong only
The Noda threatens a new intervention in the foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will strike, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
It only rose again to historic levels on Tuesday, which forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars to devalue the Japanese currency, which had just recently surpassed the record against the dollar since 1945.
But it has only since steadily risen, supported by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell back below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen mark to near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-09, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in the Japanese currency is hurting island exports, as it raises the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of the earnings earned by Japanese firms abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that the rising price will not kill the yen's fragile recovery.
The third world economy resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to the survey of the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister felt that the high value of the yen did not reflect "the national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which began a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution's lieutenant governor Hirohide Yamaguchi pointed out that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures" to indicate that no further currency weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the Securities Exchange Board increased its purchases of Treasury bills by ¥5,000 billion (€47 billion) and raised the cap on the amount it spends on purchases of various securities to ¥55,000 billion (€519 billion) in order to flood with liquidity.
The euro area:
Rates go up, the stock market crashes.
The risk of the debt crisis spreading continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weak countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still worried about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 index is down 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt is down 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"With renewed tensions over borrowing yields from euro area countries in trouble, equity markets around the world continue to make only a fraction of their recent gains".
"Nervous investors are just too aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, which was caused by market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to deal with the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchange will continue only in a narrow corridor of variations until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized", estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-launch of uncertainty about the future of the eurozone is hurting the currency itself, which continues its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 o'clock, the European currency is at $1,3570 with a 0.4% decline.
According to brokers, the currency has retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday to allow countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds is 6.85% and the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in the southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce the concerns of market participants.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti insisted on the markets to give him time to rectify the situation in Italy, which was threatened by the poisoning caused by the high level of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the 27 October eurozone summit will be the 'main task' of his government.
Spain is once again in the intentional market-line, with parliamentary elections taking place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year German and Spanish bonds reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of euro area growth figures
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0,4% in the third quarter, driven mainly by household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0,3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised downwards the figures for the second quarter to a decline of 0,1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it's the fourth quarter that's the most worrying to economists.
For its part, Germany recorded an increase of 0,5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogma
If there is one subject that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under the emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of undertakings.
It is natural that the election meeting should be an opportunity to think about such inputs and about the place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will only be successful if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France must base its position on objective facts and rational data.
There are seven billion people on the planet right now, but demographic change will double the demand for electricity between now and 2050 unless we deprive a significant portion of the world's population of essential life components.
At the same time, the shortage of fossil fuels will be needed to continue producing electricity, while not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that is currently missing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident has no effect on any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor in Switzerland, which considers it correct to build only last-generation power stations.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are continuing their projects with determination.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its fleet by one unit by rebuilding one power plant that had been interrupted by the Three Mile Island power plant disaster.
If the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, the reality is the opposite.
The choice of Berlin will be reflected in the rise in electricity prices, the increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, the sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
We'll feel all these unpleasant effects within a few months.
The case of Denmark is worth considering.
The European champion in wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which means that its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay 40% more for electricity than the average French household.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of keeping industry on the national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful claims of re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they are fundamentally not opposed to this energy, as opinion polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 secondary jobs.
The strong exporting sector draws large numbers of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises into international markets, creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear, it would sacrifice a large number of these SMEs and would lose EUR 6 billion a year, which the country receives from the export of nuclear equipment and services.
What power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while the manufacturer was scheduled to go bankrupt?
When solving the energy equation, we have to admit that there is no magic source for energy production, and there is no evil one.
The development of low-CO2 installations, nuclear installations and installations using renewable energy sources by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the National Office for Nuclear Safety, which carries out uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of the new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in their blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred in normal operating conditions and left no human casualties or environmental consequences.
The tragedy at Chernobyl was caused by the reactor's conception and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, killing tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident just as it did from the two before it.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of withstanding such phenomena.
While all interested parties wishing to build a nuclear power plant are considering it, the halt of its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift to the competitors of the AREVA group and EDF and a clear path to their taking the lead in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solutions for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogma and machinations to dominate a debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the overwhelming police, courts and administration subjected to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the "land of human rights" status that France boasts.
Recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that became a topical issue when the Minister of the Interior (see Libération of 23 May) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from an economic perspective.
I have to say, there's a pretty broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone in 1976 when he declared that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country where there are 2 million migrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of an invasion of French territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity we're willing to give to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande limits himself to banality when he states that joint development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may hold true in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, p. 352), there is broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration movements on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration is stunting growth and hurting employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially those with lower skills, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than substitutes for French workers by performing jobs in sectors with a shortage of workers.
The low level of qualified immigrants in sectors which do not attract French workers and the highest level of qualified immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not enough to provide jobs.
Positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementary relationship between the French and migrants means that the arrival of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would lead to a long-term increase in real wages of between 0,6% and 0,9%.
And it doesn't take into account the fact that diversity brought by immigrants contributes to thought and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among US Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average at 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organisation, for example, estimates that in Germany, one immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150000 to the public budget over his lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed the wish to make up for the missing growth rate "with his teeth in the sand".
The teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a precious and also a very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, because although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it has experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people might have believed that for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to conduct elections and conduct them in the most direct way possible.
But we've known since Napoleon that it was the ease of thinking.
Universal suffrage, while a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an 'instrument of oppression', as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, the organization of departments and the control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been so since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
The recognition of the mistake of the Greek yes-no referendum will be of twofold revelation in this respect: it will reveal the necessity of a great return to political power, but it will also reveal the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought through in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic fervor have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can't get anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized on the basis of need and disorganized.
A white woman exposed to a European absolutist monarch or a bound leg jumping into the empty depths of nationalism: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want knives and guillotines, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we wouldn't even know where to stop counting anyway - because there is a crisis in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its own incompetence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe which is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its peoples.
There is an urgent need to return to the leadership of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce their debt burden, get rid of market domination and invest for the future.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would be in disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, they are all now calling for a European economic government.
Be that as it may.
But to think that without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We must embark on a new phase of European construction.
To create a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" a republican.
A revolution in the interests was not enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be done by building a more politically democratic Europe and a truly European democratic sovereignty.
Let's become Europeans and build Europe.
Contactless chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair opens in Villepinte, near Paris, on Tuesday.
According to the Eurosmart cabinet, 2011 should end with an increase of 11% in the worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, SIM-based phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most prominent segment is the contactless technology, which allows for payment on public transport or for shopping by simply bringing the card close to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, compared with 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) to reach around 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After being long in the grip of APEC, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been issued.
But the big chains work for two.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To rank the higher speed class, it is necessary that banks now equip their clients with them.
"Two large French companies have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their customers in the future", says Gérard Nébouy, general manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is just the first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Only a small number of devices today are equipped with the Near Field Communication (NFC) technology needed to conduct transactions.
"They were late".
"But their real breakthrough should be next year".
"We estimate global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
The iPhones of approximately 200 clients and co-workers will be equipped with a contactless payment enabling case.
The Bank has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also, Société Générale announced yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the ties between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-standing suspicions of links to the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even admitted that Algeria had "gained certainty" about this from now on.
"The way the two organizations operate and intelligence reports indicate that there is a lot of cooperation between them", he explained without further specification.
It seems Paris has similar analyses.
An investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After the AQIM members were abducted from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day, at the same time as several of their captors, in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the attack, French and Nigerian investigators found several phones with terrorist chips.
The Terrorist Axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several individuals in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has been living in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man said to be close to AQIM and the sect.
"It's progress, but we must undoubtedly wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQIM and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this 'support' has been increasingly evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational procedures, which have since involved human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same construction as those used by AQIM.
The international community led by Washington has since pressured Nigeria to address the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a society of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Rapid success
Boko Haram, which means "Western education is a sin" in Haoussa, has approved the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a link is a quick success.
The sect is politicised and demands strict compliance with Islamic Sharia law, while its followers wage war against the central government.
These people are targeting churches, bars and government offices first.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and increased their attacks on police stations.
The government's reaction is as usual.
The army encircles the city, and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its northern base.
On Christmas 2010, he will carry out an attack in Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
It's again in June in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks police headquarters in their first suicide attack.
And in August, the local UN office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to run from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security specialists.
Now, with Al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb surrounding Mali and the games and the Somalis of the al-Shabab movement operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé said that France was on alert and ready to "transmit all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues involving China, Iran, or aiding Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are all ahead in their simplicity and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, run the world with simple or even simplifying ideas?
That's what voters might think when they hear presidential candidates.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating slogans and brief foreign policy statements that have traditionally been a Republican stronghold.
Often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel are all mixed up.
Mitt Romney, the front-runner in the Republican "Grand Old Party" nomination race, threatened to call the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulating their currency", a hot topic in America, which is being driven by the migration of parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse, if this must involve starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly stumbled on a stance that "eats away" at emotion.
He demanded a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the poll, remains unheard.
To the image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran", he declared in a fanfare.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to fulfill his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second most well-placed candidate, demonstrates embarrassing ignorance of the documents.
He recently called for a tough stance against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - obviously unaware of the fact that China has had a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he's ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They're all a far cry from the Republican nominee in 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say Reagan had simple ideas, too, and yet he won the Cold War.
They remind me that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine on the counterterrorism issue.
They point to the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, his excuses about Libya, and thus give him the label of weak
But the attack is not easy.
The public has a rather positive view of President Obama's national security policies, which have removed bin Laden.
He has no confidence in military intervention from Iraq, which leads to a ferment.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is hitting the right spot.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The long-distance Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Eastern Europe directly to Russia and runs along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has started operating.
It must supply the equivalent of gas to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday's inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new undersea gas pipeline that will directly connect Russia and Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the control valve around to control the flow of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will start to flow an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year via the first 1,224-kilometre pipeline linking the St. Petersburg region with the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Federal State.
The second pipeline, which must be completed by the end of 2012, will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the entire French consumption.
And now there's the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction is a victory.
The project was strongly opposed by Poland and the Baltic states.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being piped through the country by any third country (Poland or Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries are losing some of their power: the ability to pressure Russia by threatening to shut it off from Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw was the strongest in expressing this when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
It means to say that it's a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained more confidence in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe's energy, as the project has created rifts between Europeans from the East and West.
Russia only managed to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, high-consumption Western states whose gas fields are coming to an end five years ago.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us", François Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating at what point major gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom's senior executives present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also a major technical achievement.
The submarine pipeline is made of steel and is reinforced with a concrete shell to protect it from the anchors of naval vessels.
It lies on the seabed at an average depth of 200 m.
It was built to avoid World War II-era minefields.
"For safety reasons, almost 100 of them had to be removed or destroyed", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
The protection of fauna and flora also needed to be increased.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel bells, which is uninterrupted by valves or maintenance stations throughout its length.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project's leaders turned it down when the Swedes were less than willing to see a Russian state-owned company permanently established off their shores.
"In the event of a malfunction, we can stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute", Jens Müller explains.
If the gas is not tight, the gas in the pipeline will escape into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builder, since the welds were designed to produce a leak once every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is checked from the outside by a submarine robot pulled by a ship, while the condition of the pipeline is checked from the inside by a device that circulates inside.
This one-meter diameter cigar-shaped device is inserted into the inside of the pipe and pressurized with gas.
At the destination, it shall provide accurate information on possible deformation of metal parts during the three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s.
The long-distance pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without the slightest repair.
The circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains with Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased to this company, for a five-year renewable contract, all its gas transport capacity.
'Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,' Jens Müller explains.
The financing of the construction of the pipeline was secured by 30% shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7,4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment costs thus increased to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be recovered, as the risk is borne solely by Gazprom.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea at Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
The valves are 15 feet high and form the gas exit gate.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - the brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, founded 50 years ago, wants to bring back the joy of writing.
It smells of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
Moleskin's notebook is easily recognizable by its black rectangular plates and its white-colored leaves, which seem to have aged over time.
After all, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born back in 1997.
At that time, the Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided to launch a new, but distinctive, notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old moleskin production technique, which is used, for example, to treat the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand's head of design at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Sales rose by 26% between 2006 and 2010, to 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from the clandestine production of the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It's difficult to put together an artificial portrait of the buyer, because the notebook will appeal to businessmen as much as students or professionals.
The image of the Moleskin diary is that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded spirit.
A small Italian company that started with 12 employees has grown to almost 100 employees and, since 2008, has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributed his notebooks to bookstores and through the FNAC chain of shops to small boutiques in the heart of the city, where he was able to assert his identity.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, despite the tumultuous development of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskin's notebook: the brand recently opened the exhibition "Offering", where architects or artists exhibit their notebooks.
In August, she also unveiled a new notebook with a leopard image at the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine profits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a whole range of media.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the proportion of unemployed handicapped workers so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
Today is the 15th week of employment for the disabled.
Despite the voluntary public policies introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of disabled people is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
Is that depressing?
"No", underlines Eric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, which organises the Week for Employment of Disabled People.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high".
"However, much remains to be done".
It must be said that for unemployed disabled persons, numerous barriers to entry into employment remain.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They are low-skilled: 80% do not have a high school diploma and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which are "at the heart of the problem", according to Christiane Grapina, director-general of the Tremplin association, which was set up in 1992 to help enterprises recruit handicapped workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are still unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly developing, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entrepreneurs pour la Cité found that managers surveyed had a 'low level of knowledge about disabled people' with' an exaggerated image of people in wheelchairs and psychological or mental deficiencies'.
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Law.
The latest figures available, which date from 2008, show a figure of 2,6%.
"We are now moving around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the organisation charged with collecting fees from companies that do not comply with the law.
This is shown by the number of 'fined' enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to EUR 480 million).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What a stroke of luck"
Before the French national team (the Blues) on Tuesday night, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens were not hiding the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We won't go so far as to say that there was an alliance between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Seated side by side in the stands of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard made peace.
Five months after his striker's angry gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke only words of praise to his player.
"I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, including the fact that he loves his country".
"I want to move forward", assures the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national matches, "it's the same, he apologizes".
"I'm in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium".
"I need to clear my mark".
Hazard, saved against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the St-Denis stadium to finally "shine".
The term "joy" cannot be overlooked.
Play against the Bleus, who he's been cheering for since he was seven, and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This necessarily adds to the 'special' character of this meeting.
More so because "there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) " across the street", he recalls.
"We crossed paths immediately".
"To play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly mentioned "pride" as well.
"Pride" to win "battle - the feast".
"Pride" also to note in the quality of"neighbours" that France has become a very high-level team again, just over a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a tremendous job", he sighed.
Even though Belgium will be missing the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in 2014 on a plane with the French... heading to Brazil.
"Our little Belgians will become great", he stressed.
"We're just building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll realize that for the next games". Including against France.
Portugal very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is starting with great optimism the barrier against Bosnia and Herzegovina (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
Both teams were lacking in realism on the way there.
"At the end of 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most of all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt about it, the Portuguese national team, which he has captained since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes from happiness.
There's only one game left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Given Friday's 0-0 score in the Bosnian Zenica hell, it seems clear that nothing has been won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour's advantage, but they were unable to score such a precious goal as to relieve them.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score outside".
But at home at their stunning Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident they will advance to the boiling pot of spectators, even though the match definitely seems to be "very even", says the optimistic but shrewd Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are absolutely confident that we can have the upper hand", declared the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
A draw may be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk because we didn't score outside", Bento regrets.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start so as not to give them time to think.
Good idea, provided it proves realistic this time.
