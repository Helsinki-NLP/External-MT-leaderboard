The civil rights movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory policies and racial attacks.
"The NAACP travel advisory for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to take increased caution when traveling across the state due to a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state", the association said in a statement.
The NAACP stated that it took this action based on current Missouri state laws that make it difficult to defend racially motivated acts in court, as well as due to the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
There's a civil rights violation going on.
People are being stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they're being attacked or killed", said NAACP Missouri president Rod Chapel to the Kansas City Star.
We're getting the highest number of complaints ever.
This is the first warning of its kind issued by an organization to the U.S. government.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and was thrown into police custody without being charged with a crime.
The road map also points to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers of what could be coming to Missouri", Chapel said.
People need to be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay for a bail or to warn their relatives that they are going to travel across the country.
According to the latest numbers from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, placing the state 16th among all states.
The traffic warning is also in response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in housing or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is intended to improve racial profiling.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is still in trouble after 12 years!
The murdered model is Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie, stabbing her in the restaurant where she worked.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby café watching the forensic work being carried out to search the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years to life for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a minor, and the lawyer said his client found the girl dead in the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, had a fight the night of the murder.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming".
"She even attracted the attention of taxi drivers", he falsely claimed.
The girl, according to his testimony, should have defended herself, if she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his horny, girl-loving ways.
After sex, he'd dress her in a way that made him feel good and he had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's house, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth", Linda told the Mirror.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks from vandals destroying her tomb.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are people so cruel on the loose who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there", the Mirror revealed the information about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators can cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not superstitious or conservative", says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
It's a place where you can find designer and luxury erotic props.
Including those by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started off subtly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends are on a bike tour of Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different", she tells me over lunch.
His friend and one other associate decided to partner with German designer sex aid company Fun Factory, which got Martin interested and offered to help with marketing.
When a partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs Intimity boutique in Prague's Benediktská Street, where he sells erotic props in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I be?
These are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, right?
Come on, you're not being so puritanical!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by the acclaimed designer Karim Rashid, served as the inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of a sex shop than what everyone here is used to.
No hidden expense, everything done in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like in a perfume shop.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek Šebelka began to consider how to conceive the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It's intimate, and it's also, you could say, tender", he says.
The purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space followed, which went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
The winner was the one who had the store spread out into a garden of pleasure and a bedroom with a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Stepanova from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn't seem ideal because it wasn't on the main street, but it made it fit in with the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate, you know?
It is in the alley next to the main one, so no one is knocking on customers", boasts Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a store that was different, with a nice brand of goods, in an environment where the women who are our main customers feel good.
And not to embarrass them for entering such a store in the first place.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't feel like going to the sex shop.
Right at the door, I was struck by the sheer elegance of the interior, which I've seen in fashion boutiques.
Even if the shop is run by a woman, just because women are not afraid to ask for help doesn't mean that a man's foot is not welcome.
Mostly, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men often fail to estimate the right size and choose larger ones", Martin laughs at the common mistake.
It's just that there's this prejudice, this old cliché, that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man of good faith would choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer black underwear, whereas women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller right now is a product aptly named Satisfyer.
It must be clear from the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a touchless clitoral stimulator.
I feel a teenage need to admire the seriousness of the interpretation.
It's not like it's gonna happen.
And it's not actually moving.
It's a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
It's like the latest revolutionary innovation.
The first revolution was caused by a seahorse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women were more interested in the design of such products.
The second one was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He completely broke down the taboo that some men may have about seeing sexual aids as a competitor.
"Variants are being made", he continues.
One engine, two engines, remote control.
That's the popular category.
In a love affair, a woman can hold a remote control in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
The category of attachment vibrators is definitely a drop-off.
At least, not for us.
Czech women seem to prefer multifunctional accessories and buy conventional vibrators, even though they may only be used externally.
It's very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger customers.
What about the men?
It's hard to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it's a little different.
The question is what to offer men", Martin reflects.
"We have aids for them, but only to a limited extent". The most popular is the masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
A lot of it is focused on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, however, things are very different.
It makes me wonder.
I thought Japanese women were very tolerant of erotic aids, I object.
"This is the reality of the Internet", I was told.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, sex toys are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and taboo for women". Just for the record - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy store, sells worldwide still accounts for about half of what is sold in Japan alone.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not too forward.
On the contrary, we are a very welcoming nation.
Certainly not in countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical female customer is between 35 and 50 years of age and "has some experience with both sex life and aids.
She comes for something nice, something better, to complement her life as a partner or for herself". To ensure her return, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelkou ensure that every product is perfectly functional.
We also don't want to go into the specialties of bondage and latex, because we don't have the space for that, and it doesn't fit in the layout.
Things like that could distract the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always been shy about going to a sex shop because they were afraid of being exposed to something like that.
Many of the products on display are indeed lovely.
This is also due to the choice of the represented reputable brands.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever awarded was the aforementioned sea horse, and it triggered a change in the entire industry.
They started to get rid of cheap materials and instead work with healthy ones, they started to produce different designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that some of them are designed by a Czech woman, a popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I'm quite pleasantly surprised at how many people buy the designer stuff from Anna Mareš at Whoop.de.doo, even though it's relatively expensive.
There are customers who go straight to Anna Marešova's Venus balls.
She has done a really great job by representing within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic props can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it's a finished product, and it's made in our factory.
I wanted to have control of the manufacturing process and I also wanted to know what materials and how the Whoop.de.doo products were made.
Since it's not mass-produced, but a small batch, it's definitely more expensive than a large batch.
I may be going against the grain, but I think it's important to keep the development going in the Czech Republic.
It could well be that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything", Anna later describes to me, agreeing with Martin that our society is becoming more open.
He doesn't have a negative or dismissive attitude.
At best, they say, people are confused.
"But then they'll smile back at you". Anna Mareš is currently offering a vibrator that you can have a personal message made on, and she's also planning to launch her own lubrication gel this year.
Next year, there should be a vibration egg and other new features.
The border of healthy sex
I'm interested in what the limits of what's okay are.
Is there anything that Martin Rage doesn't sell anymore?
It's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we tend to go with the branded product line.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest request they ever got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in from a woman asking for a masturbation aid for her six-foot-tall boyfriend.
So we had to write that we have nothing of the sort.
"I wonder if someone was playing a joke on us", Martin says, looking suspiciously at me.
It happens from time to time...
A blow for Karl Gotts.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Charles the Bold is battling a serious illness.
Karl's best friend, Gotta, is fighting a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it is true", confirmed the sad news to Blitz himself.
I know my illness, and I'm managing it well, given the circumstances.
"I take medication to slow the symptoms", he added, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came here to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to stay at home as much as possible, she's going to her father's house in the White Mountains, and her daughters from her first marriage, Zuzana and Tereza, are taking care of her, and her son Karel, also called Karlas, is taking care of him.
Generously, he had fought cancer twice and shared his experience with Slavik to support him in his difficult treatment.
She's had 60 chemotherapies.
He was able to return to work after them, and to the tennis court and the ski slopes.
"My astrologer predicted that I would be here until I was 90", Karel Blesku said.
He is a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs to my mind", admits Karel.
The actress Květa Fialová is fighting the same disease in the hospital.
Do you have a family member with Alzheimer's?
Look how they treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be considered by the U.S.
In Chile, abortion is still absolutely forbidden, even for medical reasons.
"I regret that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years", complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and by the end of August it should have a new president, who according to AFP is close to the opposition.
The bill to repeal the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, passed the Senate on July 19.
The legal opposition then announced that they would challenge the law in court because they claimed it violated the right to life of the unborn child.
The MPs delayed the vote on the bill last month until it is analyzed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved the bill, and the Senate did the same.
Under the new legislation, abortion should no longer be a criminal offence in three cases: when the woman's life is in danger, when the foetus has no hope of survival, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape.
Similar exceptions existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, before women there were granted the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion was imposed in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world that has a complete ban on abortion.
The others are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, some 20 women are now behind bars, serving sentences of up to 30 years for abortion.
In many cases, human rights advocates say, the abortions were spontaneous and were ruled by the courts as murder.
Is there anything sacred anymore?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The sure sign of regime change is the criticism of the statues.
Americans could tell the story as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key backers, surely knew what he was getting himself into when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration, he brandished a symbolic axe at the Statue of Liberty.
It's worth noting that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For that, he'd be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty imitators.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller chided Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the stand as an extra, and to which you refer, is not a part of it.
Miller is factually right, but as he said, this is not about history.
These are the poignant words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today - not just for immigrants, but for the poorest of the poor: "Let me be the one who is downcast, the poor one, the one who can barely breathe freely, the one who is a miserable worm in the midst of cities".
And it's in the modern age that we're able to see these vicious worms on our screens more than ever before.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry - he was trying to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's basically a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, sought to place a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, knew well enough that she was playing a high-stakes political game.
The statue was intended to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, namely the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has a voice of her own.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The merging of poetry with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to reverse that meaning.
In 2010, noted commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in the Trump takeover - argued that the Statue of Liberty was not actually inviting anyone to the country, but representing early neo-constructionism, bringing the American flame to a backward world: "The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He brings the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to light the way to the United States.
Limbaugh is suddenly making a big point.
The meaning of a statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sculpture from the perspective of a weary and doomed traveler, who often arrives with hope in his heart in a new land after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It is literally a look at the world through the eyes of people who are seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this vantage point, the sculpture expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump are certainly not going to acknowledge.
Their torch is not meant to light the way, but to fan the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Championships in Athletics: Neil Black sings the praises of the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle remembers the days when the British team had only two Scottish members
The UK Athletics Director Neil Black said that a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Championship team would be a huge asset to the team.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland and that British athletics could learn something from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it", Black said.
I've been talking to the people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
So do the people on the streets.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.
Several Scottish athletes will be vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will be competing against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected as team captain.
Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, Black said.
A number of athletes, both Scottish and non-Scottish, walked out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and the unconcealed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will be competing in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record, set in 1983 and 2015, is seven.
The middle distance runner Muir set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
At the World Championships, she will be competing in the 1500m and 5000m.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500 metres, and this season has won the British Team Race and the Games of the Year.
Doyle recalls his first championship, which was won by the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was 'very proud' of the fact that not only had a large number of her teammates joined the team, but in many cases they would also be fighting for a place in the final and a medal.
"The extraordinary thing about being the team captain is that I was elected by the other team members, and it was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a great pleasure", she added.
Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It proves how far we've come.
They're athletes who will think about the front of the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I was just pointing out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's on home soil.
It's important to take advantage of the support of our home fans and celebrate the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance to race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office unless you can take criticism from voters
The father of our country knew his criticism.
The American people loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, he was not cold to the criticism.
But he didn't try to silence his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech may be taken from us, and dumb and dumb we shall be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on his behavior to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for these actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as baseless, and there were a lot of "who cares" comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook", said many users.
But it does matter.
Especially when it's people like Hogan.
In a perfectly democratic state, it's an overwhelmingly popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not impulsive.
As you can see, he runs his country with his own confidence and strictly adheres to his principles.
He also appears to be adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents - not unusual for him to post his first nude photo after chemotherapy.
Blocking people from visiting the governor's website - which is a public forum, marked as official, and managed by his taxpayer-funded staff - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor, saying that the blocking of comments was done from the position of moderating posts.
But it's too easy to use the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people speaking to their elected leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
As all of them indicated, their comments were polite and considerate, not abusive.
The pastor cited the Bible in his comments, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, M.D. was questioning hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted my disappointment in his lack of response to hate crimes and other news stories", she wrote in the Washington Post comment section.
I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens.
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest" would have been called "a job" by others.
The modern era of Facebook allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It's much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would have required sending employees out into the streets to collect and burn all critical literature or arrest or silence protestors.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for vilifying Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors has violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, by blocking one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's day, the low cost of the mail was practically as much an impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and its leadership was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius", and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers questioning Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions critical of his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain have been piling up in his office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader must accept that.
Czechs have quickly taken advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, the Czechs consume more of their tariff than they do at home.
Most of them are in Austria, but they are mostly in Croatia during the summer season.
One is that they spend more time on the web during their holidays, and the other is that they often don't have access to Wi-Fi.
The beach, the swimming, and the smartphone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This is according to the latest statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available on a flat-rate basis than at home.
It is no wonder, then, that in Croatia, where the minimum number of skiers travel through the winter, the consumption of data has increased by a factor of 50 during this summer season.
Italy was second in the ranking of countries consuming data.
The Czech Republic is the country with the highest number of minutes of work per minute, and many of them go there during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But here, people have traded the book for sharing experiences with their mobile phones.
The record was set on July 7th this year.
"The data transferred would have been able to hold tens of millions of photos", said Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users are in neighbouring countries.
Austria is first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We're going to Austria for hiking and active holidays, which doesn't give us so much time to browse the Internet.
"In addition, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic Sea via Austria", explained Cieslarová.
While data has seen a high year-on-year growth after the liberalisation of roaming charges, the growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled since last year.
Germany dominates this with a huge lead over the other countries.
"Roaming calls are more likely to be used by business customers on business trips", added Ms Cieslarová.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping for a homey atmosphere at the Renaissance Club.
Former golfing champion Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which is hosting the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who won the final last year at nearby Archerfield Links after losing to Paul Eales, will be the ambassador of the tournament this year, representing the club's founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty", Rafferty said.
The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a passionate advocate of the game and proud of his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.
England's Eales will defend his title for the first time, despite having won on both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I'm feeling good about it", said the Southport golfer.
I didn't have a chance to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open, because the year after my victory, the tournament was cancelled.
It's magical to be back in this part of the country.
It's a great place to play golf.
I remember last year, when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time I will never forget.
Gary Orr returns to the home turf, joining the European Senior Tour after turning 50 this year.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil", Orr said of Helensburg.
You want to succeed, and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I think I'm doing really well.
I'm happy with the result so far.
The trio will be joined on the court by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry fee is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a diaper.
In her wooden hut in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local language nota - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, she takes the potatoes out and enjoys them with her unwashed hands.
The Bardina sits on a muddy floor - the house is not furnished - where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing laundry in the turbid water of a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room with no roof supplies the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late into the night is dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol, and the village is also home to soldiers.
"After 5 in the afternoon, no one is allowed to wander around the village", says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which just 1026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands before the occupying army.
The current anti-Dutch rule movement quickly turned its anger against the Cartesian government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a remote and desolate town that can be reached by a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire, followed by a five-hour stomach-throbbing ride.
The public transport doesn't work in this place.
The town of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with roofs of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have seen this place, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
'We were not used to wearing these clothes,' says Bardina, pointing to her colourful hand-knotted turban, dark shirt and glowing skirt.
Before, we only wore leaves.
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28 percent of its population living below the poverty line, and its infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of timber.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 investigation by the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military officers and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for each officer.
The Papuan cries for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely repressed.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The mass killings in the Papui tribal area during the 1970's amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year, including extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because the incidents happen every week", said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
To make matters worse, the Papuan resources are attracting settlers to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million people in the province, 83% are professing Christians, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables and peanut sauce.
The local people are fighting for their lives.
"Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables at traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
 The original inhabitants of Papua - the mama-mama (women) - thus lost their jobs.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who goes by the nickname Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in as many as 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi with the hope that he would hear our call for justice", You said.
The fact is that just two months after the October inauguration of Jakovic, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas carols around a campfire in the town of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorbikes emerged from the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the rebuke and the tone of voice, and later returned with four other soldiers, according to local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers, in a drunken state, chased a group of children and beat them with the buttons of their weapons, according to victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby Election Commission building, and the following day, things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuans gathered on the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial bows and performed the waita dance - a running in a circle that mimics the singing of birds - of the Mee Pago Papuan tribe.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
As tensions mounted, the soldiers were given a radio order: "If the crowd makes at least three attempts to resist, you are authorized to fire", according to TIME magazine in an official document, the contents of which were never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the danger and urged the residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one paid any attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist", he told TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and there was a lot of shooting", he added.
One of the residents, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was him", said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, in a hoarse voice to TIME.
I saw him dead... and I kissed him.
Papuans Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death", said the spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many more escaped with injuries.
News of the murders leaked to the media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
'I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,' he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past violent acts.
But almost immediately, the excuses began to come.
Most of the violence has already happened.
Some of these occurred in the 1990's, and some in the early 2000's.
"I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it won't be an easy task", he said.
However, in an interview with TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he had no plans to take any action in Papua.
Instead, he said that "all cases will be brought to court".
Wiranto, who was indicted by the UN for "crimes against humanity" over the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 independence elections in East Timor - said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had been settled so far, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai shooting victims greeted his claims with distrust.
I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but I have not been able to get anything so far,said Yohanes.
I 'm tired .
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
I'm afraid, as he says.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army or shot by someone.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to speak out about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, the army started looking for me", he said.
And the shooting is still going on.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The clash, which left one person dead and 17 others injured, was between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company's building.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the officers and responded with warning shots.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation", Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded, told TIME.
I didn't leave the house for two days.
The Deiya parliament demanded the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the side of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the isolation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (PLM) - an insurgent army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the pretext of 'ensuring national sovereignty'.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known to the Papuan people as "the tragic and forgotten place".
Oil to the fire, poverty to the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is unaffordable anyway.
The people here grow their own food, mainly sweet potatoes, fruits, and leafy vegetables.
The women work the fields; each one cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is destined for the family's needs, the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).
Since the opening of Nabire Airport and the influx of new immigrants, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and more affluent immigrants.
The Papuans rarely have the capital and education to go into business.
'Young people are moving out of the villages because of lack of job opportunities and money,' said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
The isolation of Papua Province has kept it hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for failing to cooperate with the authorities, despite the fact that they had been granted such precious filming permits.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, campaigned for Jokowi to abolish strict rules on journalists and achieve transparency and development, but it never happened.
Foreign journalists working in the rebel eastern and western areas of Papua face great risks: visa denial and blacklisting, he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the Papui case is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "the diverse and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the OPCW in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir denied the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that: Indonesia is still a democratic country and the media is free, so it is difficult to cover up evidence of human rights violations.
Local people are calling for the involvement of foreign governments.
When an official Dutch delegation, led by human rights envoy Kees van Baer, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people shouted, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous, "We want freedom".
Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election in 2019, but Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people connected to the Paniai shooting", said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of a marauding army - are wallowing in poverty, a miserable education and health system.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote a debt that Jokowi must pay.
They don't want money, they want justice, he added.
Despite threats and intimidation of the victims' families, the Paniaqans continue their last symbolic act of defiance: burying the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and army stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they won't let the people responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed", Yacobus said, his head bowed.
What can we do?
The French navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine bound for Australia.
The French navy has seized a yacht in the Pacific Ocean carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was bound for Australia.
The four crew members of the vessel, who are believed to be Lithuanian and Latvian nationals, were arrested during the raid.
The boat, named Afalina, had sailed from South America and was towed by police to the port of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean, after being detained.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to pinpoint where the drugs were coming from and going and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for their action in stopping large quantities of drugs heading to Australia", said its executive director, Col Blanch.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive target for drug smugglers because of the high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of a growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
The elderly don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
The problem may be in nursing homes, but the solution, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be infusions of a physiological solution that are inserted under the skin with a thin needle.
But they're only applied in healthcare facilities.
The older a person gets, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally drink less and become dehydrated very quickly", says Mádlová.
They should drink two liters of it.
"But getting that much fluid into an old man is a big problem", she added.
She says that in nursing homes, there is often no doctor.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with an infusion.
"I think they should be able to get a subcutaneous infusion there", she said.
It suggests that up to two half-liter bottles of saline can be supplied to the elderly in a day.
Fluid deficiency can cause nausea, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration will manifest as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused", she added.
If neglected, it can lead to stroke.
Blood clots, clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and there's a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered by a blanket, at most a cotton blanket.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It is more demanding in terms of care, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin air out", said the doctor.
Dubai's second skyscraper, The Torch, is on fire
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers caught fire on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all residents of the 337-meter-high, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in the last two years at this high-rise building, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building have been evacuated and there are no reports of injuries.
We were asleep, and the alarm woke us up.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor", Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters were able to bring the fire under control around 4:00 am (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative housing for affected citizens.
The incident could reignite the debate over the safety of materials used to clad high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged were the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said that the insulation and cladding system of London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that killed nearly 80 people in June.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers entering the United States bring illegal items on board
A survey of passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the checkpoints of the U.S. government's Transportation Security Administration onto the plane. At least six percent of passengers boarded the plane with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of travelers claim to have discovered belatedly that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly attempting to travel with an item that is prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent were travelers with several thousand flight hours, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted to intentionally carrying illicit drugs on board an aircraft.
The company said it conducted research among passengers around the world to determine how many of them accidentally and intentionally passed illicit items through airport security.
Not surprisingly, most people who have carried illicit items - whether knowingly or unknowingly - travel by air very often.
As the company stressed, TSA's policies are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much fluid they can carry in the plane.
Not surprisingly, the TSA seized the largest amount of prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA would treat books the same way they would smuggled goods.
The carriage of liquids is permitted on domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt is calling for a delay in the Obama administration's planned emissions reduction guidelines.
After the EPA was sued by 15 states, EPA chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, making it more responsive than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position at the federal appeals court.
This concerns the deadline of 1 October, when countries should start implementing the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground-level ozone.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay the deal for one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid interfering with local decisions or threatening economic growth.
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's state attorney general before being appointed EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he's been in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or postponed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden turn of events on Wednesday is the biggest legal failure of Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's enforcement officer exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane emissions.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and reinforced EPA's commitment to cooperate with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
"Under the previous administration, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others to agree to settle and further set plans", said Pruitt, who in his previous position had filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadline compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt may at some point use "the discretion of delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "will be based on sound policy and the best available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive overhaul of the ozone regulations.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, said the group was not prepared to bow to legal pressure.
"The change in EPA's opinion - following our lawsuit - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution", Schneiderman added.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C. The city was also named after the state.
Ground-level ozone is produced when harmful substances commonly emitted by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are applauding Pruitt's sudden change.
'It is worrying how much pressure we have to put on changing the mindset of those in charge and protecting the air we breathe,' said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
We must continue to fight the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.
He doused a man with acid, yet he's not deemed dangerous.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're home with your family, laughing, and the next, your whole life is turned upside down.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andrew Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was smeared with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
This was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door of the Christopheros.
Andreas got up to go to the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
A man he'd never seen before, without warning, poured acid on it as soon as it was opened, saying, "This is for you, buddy".
The pain was indescribable.
My clothes fell apart like nothing, and I felt an unbelievable pain in my skin", said Andreas.
The family rushed him to the hospital, where his family received the devastating news that the doctors had no hope of survival.
For weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to invade his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of the injuries were to the face, which doctors tried to put back together using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A big complication for Christopher was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most excruciating thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from unexpected light, you can't close your eyes", he would describe his anguish.
Today, Christopheros has completed 12 operations, and it's not the last.
Plastic surgeons say that the injuries suffered by acid attack victims can require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after the most demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and spend their whole lives fighting deformities and disfigurements", said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that the unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The offender believed he was taking revenge on a man who had sexually abused a loved one.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and eventually found the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict was overturned to the astonishment of the Christopheros family.
"The three judges ultimately came to the conclusion that the sentence should be overturned because the man is not considered a threat to the public", Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of attacks by poisonous substances has increased considerably.
The Ministry of Interior has said that it plans to issue new guidelines to prosecutors regarding the classification of foodstuffs.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But the victims of such attacks are not about to give up.
They are demanding that the British government impose harsher and longer prison sentences on those who attack their neighbors with acid or other poisonous substances.
They also demand that the sale of dangerous substances, which are often available in different shops because they are different cleaning products, be subject to stricter controls.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, one of the world's largest residential buildings, caught fire last night.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the 80-storey building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
A spokesman for Dubai Police said the fire started on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
According to several residents of the house, however, the opposite was true.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us", one of the tenants said.
Another resident, quoted by Reuters, said the fire started on the top floors and spread down with burning debris.
We were sleeping.
We were woken up by the alarm, people were screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor", George, a tenant, described the event.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by the burning parts of the building.
After about two hours, the fire was brought under control, according to the civil defense.
The cause of the disease is still unknown.
Witnesses in the surrounding buildings say the power went out.
A massive fire damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There's about 680 apartments in the building.
No one was hurt, because the residents were evacuated in time.
The Mrakodrap The Torch was built in 2011 and at that time became the world's tallest residential building at 352 meters.
The record was broken the next year by another skyscraper in Dubai.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, a 23-year-old Ippolita's sample contained a variety of illicit drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson's disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is facing a four-year suspension and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record for a sportsman caught up to that time.
The third-tier player says he started taking steroids a year ago after falling out with a bodybuilder.
Lucka Vondráčková is from the Czech Republic.
She was hugging her ex-lover passionately!
Lucka Vondráčková has barely set foot on Czech soil, she's in a wheel.
And he also grabs attention wherever he goes.
The last person to fall into her arms was her former lover, Michal Dlouhý, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already longing for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang her career upside down.
They parted ways, but remain friends to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, they both blended into the blue.
They were at first oblivious to each other, but then they became close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she felt sick to her stomach.
Then they embraced and willingly posed for photographers.
Their meeting, however, was not a coincidence, as they will play a couple in the new series of Captain Exner's Premium.
Islamists in the UK have been given life sentences for plotting an assassination.
A British court sentenced four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers to life in prison on Thursday, after prosecutors said they were plotting a terror attack against the police and military.
Four men, two of whom had attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previous convictions for similar acts, were arrested last August.
Authorities believed at the time that he was about to launch a direct attack.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially manufactured pipe bomb, a knife with the words "infidel" in Arabic, and a model pistol.
It happened when an MI5 agent planted a listening device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror that the defendants could cause if they were not stopped", said Assistant U.S. Attorney Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for parole after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do that after 15 years behind bars.
The men pleaded not guilty during their trial in London and said the weapons found in the car had been planted by an MI5 agent.
The court heard the case, but then dismissed the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
The temperature in Hodonynsk is 38.3 degrees.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its highest for only two days.
The 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded at Hodonínskaya's Watchtower surpassed Thursday, making it the hottest day of the year so far.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But unlike Tuesday, Thursday was not a day of many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of 145 weather stations over 30 years old.
Only nine long-term measurement stations recorded record high temperatures on Thursday.
For example, in Watchtower, the temperature for the quarter was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Břeclavsk, the quarterly temperature of 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Pohořelice, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, like the Guardian, were set in 2013.
It was 10 degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures were recorded on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnica, the hottest places were Dyjakovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyja in Břeclav, where the mercury rose simultaneously to 37.8 degrees, but did not surpass the record.
By contrast, the highest quarterly temperatures in western and northwestern Bohemia so far have been around 22 degrees Celsius, according to the website ČHMÚ.
"The temperature didn't start to rise until later this afternoon", said the weatherman.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade and there could be more rain on Sunday.
But the temperature will remain high in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
China is short of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of the visa policy.
For decades, China has sought to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry into foreign markets, and tries to attract Western tourists.
But that's not what Beijing does.
State media there is talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of the tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
One reason is that despite its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, says University of Beijing economics professor Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
The example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free access to China, the citizens of the others must obtain a visa in advance.
The crowds at Chinese offices in the United States are therefore comparable to the Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if you don't want to wait in long lines for it, you have to pay $100 and more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of the country's population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates this problem by using the tourism industry to further its political goals, such as in its disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut off transportation to South Korea in the spring as part of a row over South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated and avoided China.
In May, visits dropped 42 percent year- on- year, while Japan recorded an 85 percent increase.
All of these affect macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the US Federal Reserve, up to $190 billion could be lost to China as a result of Chinese travel, while China will gain about $35 billion a year from selling currency to tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of 217 billion dollars in tourism last year, which is equivalent to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
The low number of tourists, therefore, is a very painful blow to a country that anxiously prevents capital inflow.
However, the factors mentioned above are only one manifestation of a more general reluctance to talk to foreigners.
In many parts of China, immigrants are virtually unheard of.
As recently as 2013, there were less than a million foreigners living in China.
Some cities in the United States have even more.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
Indeed, a number of scientific papers show that immigrants tend to stimulate economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But in China, you're not going to find them.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being proposed is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and reduce visa costs.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
Deadly venomous reptiles have been bred at the Pilsner Zoo.
The Plzeň Kingdom of Poison can now enjoy the young of three rare, deadly reptiles.
Visitors to the exhibition will see only the nine newborn Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It grows to be a meter long", said Martin Vobruba, a spokesman for the zoo.
The young of the other two species, the death-bearer and the red cobra, will for the time being be gathering strength in the breeding ground of the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them", said Nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Australia's deadliest snakes have been born eight, the offspring of a breeding pair originally from a population around Sydney.
"The only one that visitors can see in the exhibit is a Death Eater from the Perth area", Vobruba said, noting that in human care, Death Eater requires 6-8 weeks of wintering at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent successfully performed by a female African spitting cobra.
A pair at the Plzeň Zoo hatched from four eggs, a total of four young.
"The incubation period was 65 days", added Vobruba.
In the wild, this species shoots venom at its prey from as far as 10 feet [4 m] away.
It's aimed at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The cubs of all three species feed on mouse fungi in the zoo.
In the garden, the young are still expected to hatch in 40 days from the black mamba's nest, the eggs are laid in an incubator.
According to unverified transcripts of the phone call, Trump is pressuring Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has published transcripts of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The American president has been criticized for publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press".
Trump, as part of his campaign, promised to build a wall along the southern border, and said he would pay Mexico for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also leaked, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the agreement on US surveillance of refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "foolish", and insisted that if he had agreed to such an agreement - which was made under President Obama - he would have looked like a "drug-off" after proposing to ban refugees from entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that this was my most unpleasant call of the day.
Tusk testified again at the D.A.'s office about Smolensk.
"He has nothing to fear", said the brother of the dead president, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, chairman of the ruling PiS party.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me", Tusk said, accusing the current government of trying to abuse the judiciary against political rivals.
When he left the prosecutor's office, a crowd of people, according to TVN 24, was waiting for Tusk, who chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me".
He says he has no criticism of the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that justice is meant to be used by the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, the opposition or people they don't like, and I'm afraid I'm one of those people.
He was in the interrogation twice.
The ex-premier was questioned by the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time the interrogation was about the mistakes in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
After all, the bodies in the coffins were confused.
Families were forbidden to open the coffins, and there must have been a reason.
And the reason was that they were afraid of a scandal, because it would strain Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, was supposed to serve to make Donald Tusk very important in the EU", Kaczyński claimed on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could turn out differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take notice.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
He didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his summons to interrogation as part of an apparent effort by the Polish government and PiS head Kaczyński to discredit Tuska as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The prosecutor's office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The summons came shortly after Tusk was elected president of the European Council, which Kaczyński had tried hard but failed to prevent, including during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested against the extension of Tusk's mandate.
In this case, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw in the lurch.
Barma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote everywhere?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again for the composition of the House from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It's from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballot papers abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, and it's currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for a member abroad.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has provided a list of the beneficiaries of the measure, including the beneficiaries of the measure and the beneficiaries of the measure.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation", the material says.
The Regulation contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which the paper ballots are to be delivered.
This group of offices includes the Czech Republic's representation in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
Another more than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
It's their list that changes.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe, for example.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
He won't even vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
New to the list are embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, the capital of Senegal, and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation with a consulate general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'chuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect their MPs in polling stations at embassies or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Election Commission shall determine by lot the constituency for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the decision was taken between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as in this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
When it was first held 15 years ago, some 3,800 people turned out to vote, down from 6,700 in 2006 and 8,222 four years later.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters arrived at the embassies.
The Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists remembered the racist lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the watching residents of Monroe, Georgia and swerved towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - withdrew his cigarette and stared at the windshield.
Inside, the passengers were trembling with fear.
"We want that n---a Roger!" the man shouted.
Bring him to me!
The silence is interrupted by the scream of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
This scene is, fortunately, a reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a noose across Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct the fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one's ever been convicted of murder.
"It's amazing that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities", Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to organize the reenactment, said.
It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman from Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reenactment of the event is a dramatic call to action, a yearly reminder to the Monroe community that justice has not been done enough.
"We want prosecution and closure, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first", Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.
A medical examiner covers up one of the bodies of the victims of the July 27, 1946 lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were involved in the lynching.
But no one has ever been prosecuted.
Although the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both the reasons for the lynching - politics and sex - were known to all the city's residents.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that the black people of Georgia were eligible to vote in elections scheduled for the summer for the first time.
And just in time for the summer election, the FBI says black farmer Roger Malcolm stabbed white landowner Barnett Hester in a brawl allegedly over his wife.
According to Brooks, there was a town legend that Hester had sex with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and had her in a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, a prominent white-colored landowner named Loy Harrison posted a $600 bond for Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from the prison, just before the entrance to Moore's Ford Bridge, they were blocked by a group of suspects.
As it turns out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison, the FBI concluded.
It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses.
Brooks was more concise about the whole thing.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote", he said.
They always had a clear subtext for all the black people in the area: This is what you get if you register and go to vote.
The annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge incident has been organized for nearly a decade by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is evocative, engaging and poignant, and it shows the deep-rooted racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
It's not easy to watch this reconstruction, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that are hidden in all of us", Greene said.
But there can't be a relationship between us if you don't listen to what I've been through.
The main rehearsals for this year's reenactment began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - huddled in a room where Greene introduced them to a carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is serving as associate director.
He's played the leader of the Kuklux Klan for many years, but he says the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it goes against who I am", Marbaugh said.
 I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time.
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm, and Barnett Hester, are rehearsing their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm argues with Hester and accuses him of sleeping with his wife.
♪ Get off my property n-n-n-n!
Rascona is not available.
There's a fight brewing.
At that point, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts into laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascon.
He's confused
Was I too rude?
"No", Greene answered with glee.
I just don't think white people said "n--r" in that tone back then.
"Exactly", one of the black actors comes out.
♪ You gotta put more emphasis on R. ♪
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility is replaced by a sense of closeness.
Everyone wants the performance to be authentic, just to make it enough for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors are rehearsing the scene.
This time, Rascona is emphasizing the correct pronunciation of the N word.
No one laughs now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The shouting, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the mournful Billie Holiday song "Strange Fruit".
Every word in the room is a sadness.
In the background, a dozen or so spectators are wiping away sweat and tears.
There's practically equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, and many of the spectators are from the surrounding area.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in a trail to Malcolm and Dorsey's graves.
Up until now, the murders could be viewed with a certain distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is terrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene calls out to the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Kids kneel to the victims' heads, watch fake blood and immobile bodies, and whisper in their ears.
"They're not dead", the little boy said.
A few minutes pass, and Greene says thank you to the audience.
The actors are cleaning the rope and wiping their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually, he is overwhelmed with emotion.
"It's all right", whispers one of the women.
We know you resent the role.
But you had a reason.
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple enthusiastically discusses a show with a black couple they met earlier today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find the words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to listen to the ugly words and to watch the ugly deeds... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you", she said to the reconstruction.
It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic", she added, adding that "it's just called police racket".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in a courtroom, enjoying his dinner while he talks about civil rights.
According to his own words, he's already started planning the show for next year.
'The reconstruction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to reflect on,' he said.
If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and study their country's history are doomed to repeat it.
I love the instructions.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads the user manual.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It's one of the modern art forms, often pure surrealism.
I'm nostalgic for a time long ago when instructions for using anything were rather rare.
For example, my first phonograph contained only one sheet of paper with hieroglyphics showing the connection of some components, all with some secret markings.
When something inside me went wrong, I offered the list to the shaman, who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin, he told me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was for.
Yes, it was a common aid to chronic toilet-paper depletion.
He found the cord unplugged and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl records again.
The new age brought new guidelines.
Even a relatively simple juicer, with a simple grapefruit cut on the end, required about ten pictures.
Especially instructive was the diagram that showed how to slide one part into the other.
The trial was a two-step process, and there was no other way.
To make it the other way around required considerable effort, with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My contempt for the manual ended with my Seat Leon.
The 2003 model year still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including, among other things, the replacement of the flashlight bulb.
It was simple.
Three steps and the job was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb went to the right, it really only went to the right in three steps.
One, take the cover off.
Two, unscrew the burst bulb and screw in a new one.
Three, put the cover on.
The bulb on the left had a problem placing the battery cover.
At first I thought that by inserting my right upper leg into the car's interior I would carve a spring, a screw to easily remove the hood, and then I would follow points 1-3 of the book's economical author.
The boot's wrong.
That shelter had no place, no room for even a thin hand of Cinderella, let alone a fat Sleeze.
I've wasted half an hour of my life, and I've done it without any success.
The situation was further aggravated by my wife's entering the garage, which was called by a roar and the words she hears from my mouth are quite exceptional.
"What are you doing here?" she asked me candidly.
My answer took about 90 seconds, but if I omit the vulgar terms, there were only two words left to be published.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why are you taking so long?" she ventured with a sentence that might be her last in a long-term relationship.
I explained the problem slowly, with the main emphasis on the torture of the author of the instructions, where the burning of the hand that wrote the instructions with a hot iron, followed by her running away so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of the Hammer's instructions to the witch, including his commissioned burning on the top of the Castle of Losinsky.
"How about dismantling the box?" the woman asked, as she was assembling the battery.
In sheer desperation, it did, and then step one through three was as easy and as quick as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just coming out of a collapse after being checked by two drug-control officials.
I know him as a colleague of a man of balance, who has experienced the impossible and the possible in his profession, and who can tell even wild stories in a calm voice.
"Imagine I got a fine for not having handwashing instructions on the wall", he told me in a low voice.
I was able to work out the problem, which was that there was no graphic instructions on the patient's toilet to wash his hands.
His argument to the commissioner that adults could normally wash their hands and that they didn't need pictograms to do the usual work of decent people had no healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"Well, it's not just that", she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of soaped hands with running water was a primitive act on the level of the crustacean, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this rite in ten steps.
Then you have to tell them that the water needs to be drained.
The whole process has eleven points, but at the end, there's the joyous discovery that the person washed his hands exactly as the S.U.C. housekeeper tells him to.
Finally, I must say that I have been inspired to prepare a detailed plan of action on the toilet.
The procedure is uniform in the case of defecation, there will be no problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to post two instructions.
The problem is the pictograms, for the perfect procedure requires an exact sketch of every anatomical detail, which might cause a certain indignation in the prudish visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he may finally learn that he has been cleaning the hole all his life by the wrong procedure.
Pearson is laying off 3,000 more employees and cutting dividends in an effort to revive the business.
Britain's Pearson Education Group said on Friday it would lay off another 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing its business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which according to CEO John Fallon will take place at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, follows the company's previous decision to cut 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost reduction programme in an effort to revive a declining business due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said its outlook for this year remained unchanged after reporting a one per cent rise in core sales in the first half of the year to £2.05bn.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a NATO statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh urban district.
Afghanistan was hit by a bombing this month - more than 30 people were killed Tuesday in an explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In its statement, NATO said the explosion occurred after a patrol with members of the Afghan military was attacked by 'a local person with a homemade explosive device'.
The statement further states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the sources, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern to NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with 20 percent of the victims in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban have claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining an already fragile situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to help the military and police in the country.
According to the report, the suicide attacks that have occurred in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its policies and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA reviewed its decision to move the smoking rules
The EPA has reversed its decision to delay the Obama administration's law that ordered states to reduce emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to pass the 2015 Ozone Standards on Wednesday night, saying it was committing the agency to cooperating with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our national partners and listening to their views", EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on the measurements, set limits that must be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday arguing that the EPA's actions are illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama proposed -- in Trump's words -- to spur economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have been met with a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air containing ozone can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Drummer was hit and blood was flowing!
This, a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in Czech conditions, which hosted such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show the public and present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was attended by the just-named personalities.
But few people know that the filming of the music video in Russia was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian National Ballet, and it was not without its share of embarrassment.
Sara's song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For dramatic effect, the singer's juice was supposed to imply a slap.
At one point, however, he struck him so hard, right in the nose, that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately my nose started bleeding", Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers on the set said it was an accident and Ladislav had not reacted in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the filming.
The video clip of the young artist in question is now available, and you can also record the scene of the strike.
The unnamed version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko were talking at the meeting about the possibility of a duel between each other.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match ever, met for the first time in a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room in the Los Angeles offices of ESPN until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, came down to the lobby to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
Poce's victory by unanimous decision over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime bout, both boxers have entered the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia reaches out his right hand and says, "How's it going, champ?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN at 7:00 on Saturday.
The boxers pose for photographers and Lomachensk's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be "the perfect test".
"I'm a former featherweight champion", Garcia says.
I've gained weight since the fight with Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 63 kilos.
I'd like to get back into the lightweight division.
Lomachenko needs to gain weight again to get to the lightweight... then we can race.
That's what the fans want.
Why not fulfill them?
The Romanian agrees.
"Boxing could benefit from this match".
Klimas has filed a request for a pay-per-view - part of his strategy - Lomachenko is set to make his lightweight debut later this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who has also expressed interest in a match against the winner of the Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell duel, who will fight for the lightweight title on September 23 at the Forum Arena.
"The game should be a pay-per-view format, as fans demand", said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the game through the TV station that comes up with the best offer.
We're the main attraction.
No one else draws that kind of attention.
We'll wait for the right opportunity...
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a great fighter and would like to participate in his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn't let Garcia's praise get him down when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're calling for a knockout".
Garcia said his goal was to show off his strength and then box.
Both fighters reported feeling a heightened tension before the fight.
You won't forget this game.
No other game has drawn as much attention.
And I'll be happy to add to the fire", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey".
It's going to be a great match.
A young couple vanished without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasova, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched, but without success.
And the police eventually dropped the case for lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived in the uncertainty of never learning what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the sad ending of the whole story came.
The wreckage of their car was found by a layman diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the city of Cheboksary, Chuvash.
Only with the I.D. left in the car were the cops able to identify a couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without which it would have taken police much longer to identify the findings.
The couple were last seen together when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his find to the Cheboksar police, who the next day hauled the car onto the beach.
Investigators believe the death of the young couple was an accident caused by the icy road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing, and further details will be published when it is completed.
Latest test results for age limit for asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who underwent a new age-assessment method show that over 80 percent of people were interviewed as being over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (RÃ¤ttsmedicinalverket) started to carry out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more precisely in the assessment of asylum applications. e measure was introduced after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
As of today, the Swedish Migration Agency has handed over 6880 cases to be investigated and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
In the case of the elderly, the age of consent is considered to be the age of consent in the case of the elderly.
In another 423 cases, the respondent was determined to be a 'maybe under 18 years of age'.
The tests are only used if the age of the person questioned is in dispute.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"Compared to last month, the statistics are in the back seat and the numbers are very similar", he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, "the person in question was 18 years or older".
Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would turn 18 this year.
Critics have also been drawn to the medical method of determining age, which involves x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then evaluated by dentists and radiologists.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus of Karolinska Institute, who studies, among other things, the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which they reach puberty.
I had reason to think about this issue and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
Assessing biological age is very uncertain in a sense.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise", he told the Metro newspaper.
The Agency's forensic medical agency, GÃ¶ransson, defended the decision, saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person being questioned is just under 18 years old, which in this case corresponds to 10% of all those questioned.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump, in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, threatened to not meet with him if he publicly said that his country would not pay for the wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump spoke with the same frankness to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of the major promises of his campaign last year.
In his first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump non-diplomatically reprimanded Pena Nieta for being critical of his wall plan.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press that", Trump said repeatedly in the January 27 interview, threatening to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continued to issue defiant statements.
He says the funding will come together and it will all work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to hang out with you guys anymore because it's unacceptable to me", Trump said, according to the American newspaper.
He said the wall was the least important thing we talked about, but politically it's probably the most important.
Trump issued an executive order for the wall shortly after taking office.
Mexico's refusal to build or finance the 2,000-mile-long (3,200 km) wall has strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said that the project would be paid for by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief of staff called the conversation ridiculous.
He came to this conclusion after an exchange of views on an agreement by which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in people from internment facilities in Pacific island nations.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but then he went along with it.
"Certainly you can say this is not the deal you made, but you have to stick to it", Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbul was almost joyous, such as when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me", joked Trump.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation became sharper.
"I hate to admit these people", Trump noted.
I assure you, they are bad.
That's why they're in prison.
"They won't be great people to go work for the local dairy farmers", he said.
He also noted in the interview that a refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
In late January, about a week after taking office, Trump conducted phone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in a single day.
Turnbull's call ended up being the least pleasant call of the day.
Before he closed it, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed the Rana killer in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose as his victim a little girl named Rana Almatari who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He raped her body and dumped it near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has shocked the entire country, which faces the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a crowd of thousands who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father shared his feelings with the media after the execution.
I feel like I've been reborn.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It's a new day in my life.
Other family members were present, shouting "Long live justice" with the crowd.
The assailant in the square was brought in by a police van, from which he was dragged out.
The officers tied him up and put him on his stomach.
One of the men turned his weapon on him and opened fire at close range.
The crowd cheered each shot that was fired.
Mr al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice was served in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed", he added.
I stood in the Liberation Square in Sana'a, waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ranina's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been served.
The police feared that the crowd in the square would go into a frenzy of hatred, the murderer would be caught and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court under the control of the Shiite Houthis.
Maghrabi was originally sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act caused such outrage that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ranina's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his home, they found evidence that the man had planned his attack.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to Rana.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that were inflicted on Rani's body were terrible", he told the media.
"Rana disappeared this afternoon, we reported her to the police the same day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture were everywhere", he continued.
Everyone believes that the police received a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of committing a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana went out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemenis were outraged by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the crowd to calm them.
The accused did not seem to have any remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police officers read the sentence, but the condemned man only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many of the footage that was taken by the crowd has surfaced online.
The governor of West Virginia has announced a change of political party.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at President Trump's rally that he was switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have turned their back on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and consideration, I am announcing to you... today, as a citizen of West Virginia, I am telling you that I can no longer support you as the Democratic governor. "
The crowd of onlookers erupted in joy.
"I'm joining the Republicans tomorrow", Justice added.
As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game.
Trump has already promised the people at the West Virginia rally a major announcement.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the entire country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that said, "The passing of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of working to lift our country".
"For the Democratic Party, which has just 15 governors and controls the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is the last straw for an already-distressed party without a leader who is struggling to find a positive and unifying message", RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's frank apology for the doping scandal
Former world-class athlete Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised Russia for apologizing sincerely for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the world of sport.
Russia's athletics chief, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said at the IAAF Congress - held on the eve of the World Championships in athletics - that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way".
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a WADA report found that Russia had supported doping by its athletes.
'I think we have witnessed a very sincere response and presentation today,' said IAAF President Sebastian Coe to reporters.
All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working hard to rectify and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation.
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was a very successful day and we've taken it to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis team to maintain the punishment imposed on Russia", added Coe.
We must do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the coming months.
Our effort has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones, he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begin Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes who have met the strict IAAF rules will compete under a neutral flag.
IAAF emergency chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it can be allowed back.
The drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the suspended coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF Council presentation.
The CzechTrade public contract was awarded to František Savov, whose state is suing.
The contract for the State export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
The officials gave him a 100 percent score on all the quality criteria.
They were not bothered by the fact that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, awarded a public contract for four years to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract worth a total of 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the Mladá Fronta publishing house by entrepreneur František Savova.
In 2014, the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and is pursuing him as a fugitive.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is seeking his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the Aktuálně.cz server.
According to the original criteria, the award of the contract was to be decided by CzechTrade on the basis of 60% of the price offered and the remaining 40% of the beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
It was the second criterion that had helped Savova's firm significantly.
According to the information provided by Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all the sub-quality criteria.
This resulted in her being moved ahead of the next candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While the Mladá Front operated with a sum of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, however, it received below average ratings from the evaluators in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also participated by the consultancy firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like Aktuálně.cz, is part of the Economia publishing house.
VLM publishers raised several objections to the outcome of the tender, claiming that its assessment was unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it decided to challenge the competition with the Office for Protection of Competition, OOHS.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The Applicant believes that the Contractor has reached its decision to select the public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective evaluation, clearly favouring the Mladá fronta, a.s. contractor, to the detriment of the Applicant and other contractors", reads the Motion for Opening of Proceedings filed with the Office this week, published by Aktuálně.
According to VLM CEO and Chairman of the Board Michal Klima, the selection committee's scoring appears to be unreliable and the 100% assessment of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such miraculous success of one of the contestants as unlikely and suspicious", he told Currently Climate.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
As a general rule, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All the information you have mentioned about the contract has been published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the Contractor and in the Procurement Bulletin.
"After the contract is concluded, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on the progress of the contract during its duration", said agency media representative Štěpán Dlouhý to Dotyk.cz.
Mladá Fronta responded with a statement that it considered it extremely problematic that the publisher Economia had interfered with an article in Aktuální.cz in a competition where it has its own business interests.
However, this was mentioned in the article.
The fact that she had been providing editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years may have helped her in the tender.
The contract was first tendered in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Mr. Martim Kuba ODS.
František Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by his company, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, the leader of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house is, is behind his criminalization.
The London court rejected Savov's extradition appeal last year, but the businessman appealed.
"In our view, the case has not moved since last year, we have not received any information from the UK on the case of the acquiring of the legal force of the judgment until now", said the spokesperson of the Prague City State Prosecutor's Office, Štěpánka Zenklová, to Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to his ownership of Mladá Fronty, Savov was involved in the Cyprus-based company Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Czech brewery Samson, and in the Cyprus-based company Maraflex, which is a self-styled investment fund buying distressed assets.
He's also in charge of Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which is bankrupt and over $3 billion in debt.
In the past, Savov has also been linked to the seizure of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker rode the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the rolls.
The motorcyclist attracted attention by his reckless driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to run away in the direction of the station.
"Police officers pursued the man with increased caution when he lost control of the vehicle on one of the side roads behind the Mariánské Lázně and entered the field on a motorcycle where he crashed", police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
The accident eventually led to the arrival of an ambulance helicopter, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the hospital in Plzeň.
Afterwards, the police discovered that the motorcyclist did not have a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle had been stolen, his production number had been scratched off, and the production plate itself had been removed.
It's possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"A breath test was performed on the scene to rule out the presence of alcohol on the driver, but the test was positive for methamphetamine", added the police spokesman.
How the financial rules of football will affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not affect Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona, Spain, to Paris Saint Germain, France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid a whopping 222 million euros just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will be demanding a salary in the tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are the financial terms of Neymar's move to France.
Since PSG is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has made its fortune selling energy, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The Commission notes that the clubs are not obliged to provide the players with the necessary financial resources to enable them to fulfil their obligations under the contract.
The FFP was launched by Michel Platini after he took over as UEFA's Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that over-indebted in the pursuit of new supplies would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules shifted its focus from club debts to monitoring club losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players and building a global brand - suddenly wasn't so profitable.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Spanish authorities on the measure.
And despite Platini having to leave office in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future", said Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, to the Associated Press last week.
The French authorities have also stated that the transfer of the club to the club was a 'regular' transaction, which was not the case in the past.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be written off at EUR 44,4 million per year for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi Group.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million) - later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League squad to 21 players for the 2014-15 season, instead of 25.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
The Commission notes that the financial statements of the players were submitted to the French authorities on the basis of the information provided by the French authorities.
The Commission also notes that the financial support provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was not sufficient to cover the costs of the club's financial support.
Some of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be reportedly being paid for by the Qatar 2022 organising committee.
However, PSG and the 2022 World Cup in Qatar officials denied that Neymat should become a World Cup ambassador and that such a move would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be watching closely for any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to insiders on Tuesday, UEFA has not opened any investigation into Neymar's move to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the PSG situation, according to The Associated Press.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any evidence that the measure was necessary to ensure the effective implementation of the State aid rules.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of the jerseys.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30% when it signs the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned with the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to derail Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' by both the club and the state",La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares the same La Liga stance on club funding.
"It's the consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the world of football in the last 15 years", Wenger said Thursday.
Once the club is owned by a state, anything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club.
Spartan back-up Rosicky: Change is painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand cheering fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the field.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder was playing against the Red Star, he made a few goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
The summer team, pumped full of new multimillion-pound reinforcements, is now out of action after their first double in the European Cup.
Was it hard to do anything with the game after taking Belgrade?
A goal scored required four shots, which was hard for us.
We wanted to not lose, to boost our confidence, so we could have something to bounce back from in the next game.
We had a chance.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why was Sparta not able to get in the match for so long?
The game is so elaborate.
The opponent's combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we only fired once in halftime.
Of course, that's a lot of money when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, and in the final third we were able to play them.
But you have to push your opponent into these positions more often.
Is the problem the large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new manhood.
We've only played three competitive matches, and the lineup keeps changing.
The point is, the coach has to find the perfect 11 that fits.
Is it encouraging to you that you've played parts of two games in a row?
They're still just parts of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop or when I'll be able to play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same with injuries.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, and we must be optimistic, or the situation will worsen.
Once again, the fans came in large numbers, but they left in confusion.
What can you tell them?
There was another wonderful visit, as with the Goddess.
I'm so sorry we couldn't make them happy with a better performance.
Show something that will make them come back.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember such visits when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a no-cup season be a benefit to the league?
We're fighting with ourselves, playing games, so it's not a big advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman is sentenced to ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Tomán, who is to serve ten years in prison for tax evasion on a large scale.
The damage is estimated at 645 million crowns.
Toman in his complaint claimed that the justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are allegedly incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Court judges found the complaint to be unfounded, ČTK found from the court database.
The U.S. is not another court of appeals.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, examine errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by the ordinary courts, unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms", the resolution reads.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
Toman was then in custody in Argentina, where he was also at the time of the RP decision, according to the resolution.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court has called the case an extreme tax evasion case that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million crowns occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage according to the expert was over a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to prosecute Toman for the full amount.
The indictment alleges that World Service failed to include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly payments of VAT and excise duty, at least tens of millions of crowns were paid in statistical units.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company did business have a relationship with the businessman Radomir Vybiralov, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT fraud in fuel deals.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court before the time.
The series "Flight to Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic chord
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for characters from the glamorous 1980s; the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter brought to life the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and, of course, the modern day, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd branched out into bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it's a lighthearted parody and also the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of enduring memories.
From the franchise's point of view, it looks like someone's running out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of its absurd humour (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can of vegetables, told by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have deviated from the main point of the joke - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny kids - and cannot make fun of past events.
The follow-up to Ten Years Later, in which the adults' play adults don't push as much on the emotional plane, and the satire is sporadic at times, including parodies of '90s thrillers such as Hand on a Crib.
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbooks, roller skates and a bunch of other things from 1991.
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't gotten over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well played by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
Especially amusing is watching the ever-young, long-haired Rudd aka the character Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once-respectable character Andy is now an old man.
The franchise could be set to random moments of madness, like the upcoming series Seven Up, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, when the last scene of the film sees the entire cast head out for the premiere of The Year of the Invincible.
Meanwhile, Amazon's Comrade Detective appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of the series Normal Americans, the film Atomic Blonde: No Regrets, and even the GLOW series, which pits icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes against each other.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka and directed by Rhys Thomas, is intended to be a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from 1980s Romania who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, who were dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as the police watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series features the voices of many well-known actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective is focusing too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan-masked killer - and it looks like it is.
Six long episodes is too extravagant and comedic moments are not enough.
The next step could be a propaganda satire in Comrade Detective, such as the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the US Embassy, in whose lobby two fat men swallow hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into prey and orgies.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: we do this with our own culture, as well as theirs.
Russian athletes were not expecting the lifting of the IAAF's ban on competition.
The International Athletic Federation, IAAF, at its congress in London, confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian athletes due to the state-supported doping program.
The voting on the site of the World Championship, which begins on Friday, was as expected very unequivocal.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, only 21 voted against.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia has failed to meet all the requirements for the implementation of the anti-doping system, as stated by the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Team, Rune Andersen, before the Congress.
His group recommended that the ban be maintained.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, many suspected athletes have yet to be heard and there are still coaches with a disgraced reputation working in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency, RUSADA, is not yet fully operational, and does not meet the World Anti-Doping Agency's standards.
However, RUSADA may conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done", said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, which meant that Russian athletes missed out on last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, among other things.
Despite the upcoming ban, the Olympics will feature 19 Russians who have already proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for an extended period of time.
But they won't be allowed to wear the national colours at the championships and if they win, they won't be allowed to play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a lackluster economic growth and a weakening of inflation that has dampened speculation about a surge.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain in the background with interest rates held - despite the squeeze on household budgets.
Policy makers at the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 in favour of keeping the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the rate hike vote supported weak economic growth, supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the contraction in household budgets would continue.
The Bank also indicated that growth should take place over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that rentals from mobility should increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and which was put into place last year as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Term Funding Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less than the £115 billion planned.
Just before the decision, the bank stated: MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, together with the pressure on real household incomes and the burden on consumption.
On the issue of inflation, the Bank said that it would need to tighten monetary policy belt to calm inflation, and to a greater extent than the markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be 'slow' and 'limited'.
The bank has downgraded its growth forecast for this year and next year, compared to the 1.9 and 1.7 percent forecasts in May.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on the compatibility of the measures with the internal market.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following the publication of the estimates.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth had buried hopes for further growth - GDP stood at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a small consolation for households hit by rising inflation and poor wage growth, which the bank said would get worse before the increase.
The report also states that monetary policy will not prevent income reductions in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise substantially towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow due to strong demand for British goods due to the weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025 percent in August last year in response to the shock EU referendum vote, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that complete convergence of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many had called for a rate hike in conjunction with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, even though the bank said it expected this change and that inflation would rise again in the next month.
The Bank stated that the overshoot relative to the 2% target was due entirely to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase as lenders begin to compete for contracts with a good view to the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are terminating existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low rates that they are finding to be appealing.
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will be given access to 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September on the basis of the Supreme Court's decision on NHS funding.
The National Health Service (NSH) of England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a high court ruling last year that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite stating that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England's Director General, Simon Stevens, as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients, with more clinics joining in October and full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among at-risk patients.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there is enough of the specific medication in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign a consent form to participate in the trial, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also go to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in the trial.
The programme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international public tender.
The pilot period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of efforts to halt one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: "We are witnessing a defining moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and to patients at risk, it offers the potential to turn the tide of the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require partner persuasion, resulting in improved quality of life for many.
We welcome this declaration.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust said: "The number one priority must be rapid deployment of the test nationwide; we need to ensure it is available to every patient.
We now have a trial PrEP drug and are well on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of government delays and hold-ups.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The follow-up tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect those who are exposed to HIV and together to end the spread of HIV in society.'
High-end living: a middle-of-the-road and clever design turned this little flat in Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, traded her big house in Knightsbridge for an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the Queen Anne Smart Terrace, it is a striking example of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge area", Joanne said.
I was looking for something a little more reasonable.
I came across this flat in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away and I nodded to him that very day.
Since then, the 1,000-square-meter apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
I wanted a high ceiling, big windows, lots of light.
That was my demand, she said.
To do this, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based design and engineering firm Duck & Shed and used the nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two openings - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine that could be walked up.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated", he explained.
We had to arrange both rooms so that we could walk upright.
It was not only a simple platform, but also a steel structure, bent to the right height above and below the ceiling.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - while adding to the drama.
In the middle floor, looking out on the magnificent living room, the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
The mirror furniture in gold, the silver lines and the retro chandelier of Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is lined with mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror rack in the kitchen looks like a window to another room.
There are storage rooms with mirrors for storing utensils and glasses at the entrance doors.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a much larger space, is that it can be separated from the kitchen when it is not in use.
Closed kitchens are nothing new.
But what's unique about this solution is the folding doors.
"We had to solve the technical problem", says Erfan, "of reinforced air doors.
The doors are fitted with counterweights to make them easy to unlock.
Through clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 40 square feet, a second bedroom, and a better overall layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is the living space - or the appreciation of your property", Erfan said.
The real estate agent basically calculates the estimated price of the apartment based on the living area when entering the apartment.
In this case, the living space was increased while maintaining the quality of the materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home", Erfan added.
You don't like electrical connections in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they don't win your heart.
As it turns out, good design and living space enhancement can turn an ordinary apartment into an extraordinary work of art.
And like Joanne, you can choose to stay, eventually.
The United States is disintegrating.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a travel ban for its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the literal sense, as U.S. citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
The point is that California has forbidden its citizens from spending state funds to travel to eight other states, which are Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly pro-LGBT and considers any disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
But Tennessee has passed a conscience law that says a therapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of LGBT patients is not obligated to provide it, but is obligated to provide those patients with a therapist who does not have a moral problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that religious charities that have adopted children from mothers after they were born are not required to give those children to same-sex couples for adoption.
Because of these conscientious objector laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens' travel to the eight states of the Union from its own funds.
In practice, this means that California professors cannot have their trips to scientific symposia in, say, Texas, paid for by their universities, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions in, say, Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants to travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund travel for citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience, and its legislature passed a bill with a resolution that it too dislikes California's policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but it still does not support a travel embargo on California.
He's going to shut them down as retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same shall apply to any State of the Union which imposes a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass conscientious objection laws, as well as decide what their money will and will not be used for.
Second, what's wrong with conscientious objection?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just sell beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of a fine, force him to sell even pigs, when there are plenty of butchers offering pigs?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or any that contain alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can make their own domestic policies in non-federal powers, according to their own preferences, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is the variety, the diversity, the diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and the seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community have rightly sought to tolerate their lifestyles in the past.
Today, many members of this community follow the live-and-let-live rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek, not tolerance of themselves and others, but extreme intolerance of others.
It states that no one may ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and that anyone who does so should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of any situation in American history where states have made such a deliberate decision for political reasons, except for one.
Even in the days of the civil rights struggle for blacks, when the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South was on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only exception was the 1850s, when the political cause was slavery and the North was leaning toward war with the South.
Of course, none of that is happening now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is deepening and the US is mentally disintegrating.
Unlicensed agitation.
The critic of Putin got a hefty fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
He was fined by the court for calling for people to participate in unsanctioned demonstrations.
Navalny has organised two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and has announced his intention to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
The incumbent Kremlin head Vladimir Putin has not announced his candidacy yet, but is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is 300 grand.
"We will later take them off the judge's salary", a critic of the Kremlin joked on Twitter.
The Russian electoral commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot run for president because he was previously convicted of embezzlement.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the relevant sentence to be politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, was also imposed on Thursday by the court on two members of Navalny's pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything they can to protect Navalny's campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years' probation for robbing the forestry company Kirovles.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the appeals court.
The verdict is so final, that Navalny is barred from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting over a $500 million empire.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, are vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over joint property and business assets all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business back in 2014, but the acrimonious dispute is constantly being swept up in the Supreme Court.
Along with their mother, Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars.
It was here that the family started Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 brick and mortar stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money has bought more property, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrent, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, in Paul's words, is 'a significant driving force and dominant personality' of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records show that Colin owns real estate worth $316 million, while Paul manages real estate worth $176 million.
It was the distribution of assets and finances that became a problem for Paul.
"Colin's motion has, in my eyes, been decidedly in his favor", Paul wrote in an affidavit in court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are also now vying for control of an existing business - the one Paul says Colin cut him off from.
Colin is arguing that this is not true, and he's accusing Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
In his previous affidavit, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that family is the most important thing", he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and counsel for both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and delicatessen since the 1950s and bought a grocery store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money they had raised from the mortgage, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin said that when he started Westco in his senior year of high school, Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old.
Anna De Lutis stated that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped that the transfer of the estate to the sons would be smooth.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court", she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, 'they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation'.
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former member of the AFL board, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only responded by text message, stating that, given the fact that the dispute was being resolved in court, I had nothing to add.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the matter to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in one of his court statements that he had tried to accommodate his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation", he said, adding that he "still hopes for a good solution".
On Friday, all hope was lost.
"Our differences will soon be settled in court", Colin wrote.
The Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
The MHD drivers are wearing water and summer clothes.
At the nursery school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, which now has about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The nursery is being rebuilt and the trees are not yet providing much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers take their kids to the nebula.
In the afternoon, the children are left in classrooms with the blinds drawn and the curtains drawn.
The air is trying to cool down through the air purifier because they don't have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside is above the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open operation during this period", said the kindergarten director, Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in the nursery, where she says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We'll vent out after 6:00 in the morning, the windows will close, and we have blinds on the south side to protect us.
"But it doesn't help much", she added.
They have better conditions at the forest kindergarten in Hostivicka, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have mature trees on our property, so we're underneath them.
"We have a beautiful nut tree, a table underneath, and we do all sorts of things", explained the school's headmistress, Barbora Kompanova.
Teachers try to take their children to the woods, where there's more snow.
Kids are getting their hats wet and there's a variety of water games on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children", said Kompanova.
The director of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek district, Jitka Vilimovská, also said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and drip them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under there trees", she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child needs a head cover.
The teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They may choose to drink tea or juice that is low in sugar, and they have a watering hole in the garden.
They also have a vegetable salad every day and a snack of fresh fruits and vegetables, sometimes brought by their parents.
"Today, a mother brought in a ten-kilogram melon for the children", added Makovičkovka.
Drivers get water or summer uniform.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer clothes on hot days.
The cabins of the drivers of trams and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said the spokeswoman of the DPP Aneta Řehková.
Air conditioning is also provided in the passenger compartment, in addition to the cabins of some trams.
The tram tracks have not yet been seriously affected by the high temperatures.
There was minor damage to the loop in the Host.
In the current high temperatures, we take special care to ensure that drivers have enough drinks.
'Clean drinking water is available at all lanes, intersections and roads,' said Mr Grehková.
In the carriages and at some switching points, employees have so-called soda makers at their disposal, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble protective ionic drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts", the spokesperson added.
The hot, dry weather of the past few days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters throughout the Czech Republic killed 108, twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, with temperatures in the Czech Republic soaring above 90 degrees Fahrenheit [35° C], firefighters were busy fighting the fire.
"Natural fires and those associated with harvesting work predominate", said fire department spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
The evening change of weather, with thunderstorms and torrential rain in many places, did not bring relief to the firefighters.
Firefighters have responded to 236 fires in connection with the storms.
The main task was to remove the fallen trees and branches.
"They were most active in the Central Bohemian region", Zaoral continues.
But the firefighters were also needed in Stvoilinka, Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from a children's camp to safety because of the storm.
The tropical temperatures also made Prague's rescue workers more busy.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances were dispatched with dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the camel.
People should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colourless, odourless gas that is released by incomplete combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
If poisoning is suspected, the infected room should be left.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curtail the president's media diet
Many before him have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he is, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of President Trump's information - including coverage of television news - in hopes of keeping Trump afloat.
Here's a snippet from the report by Josh Dawsey:
When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly met with staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem the Trump White House is looking to fix: the misinformation that is getting into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or in person - because the president can make better decisions based on the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors have been very concerned with Trump's control and media presentation.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media outlets that were easier to convince", said Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, to Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least according to six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors media outlets that praise him.
I'm going to go.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't vetted.
The tweets that Trump never posted, we'll likely never know about.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from stirring up controversy on a regular basis.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of competing factions, people regularly try to bolster their agenda by feeding Trump material - which may or may not be reliable - that supports their view of the world.
Politico, which has covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to present dubious information to the head of state.
Here's an example of such information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts with great anger to negative media reports, especially leaked reports, and seeks to find their source.
This situation came to light in late February when someone planted a copy of an article on GotNews.com - the website of the provocateur Charles C. Johnson - that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the source of many White House leaks.
Regardless of whether Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment; or whether he had not backed up his claims with any evidence; or whether he had already made false accusations public in the past and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter had tried to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump receives.
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to implement the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness doesn't go away, and his aides are still vying for power.
These unchanging factors will surely make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the "Millionaire District"
Some of the most affluent homeowners in England's West Midlands are once again in conflict with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the rights to reclaim the land for their estates.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a thriving street in Solihull, dubbed the 'millionaire's quarter.'
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being evicted in May, not to be scared by the moat that was dug on the spot by order of the authorities to prevent their incursion.
Tactical found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravan's unprotected gap that served as a roadway.
The district's angry residents have attacked Solihull City Council as "unable to solve the problem".
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "They occupied the site on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another location and now they're back.
Last night more arrived, and today there will be more.'
She added: 'Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this problem, using court orders to protect the parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: "It's ridiculous, we just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A spokesman for Solihull City Council said: "We are aware of the unauthorised presence on the property near Streetsbrook Road and in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal action to resolve the issue successfully.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it's imperative that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or illegal behavior to the police at 101.
This will give us the whole picture to present to the court.'
MEP's husband hit by car in Brussels.
He was brought in by a government special.
A government special transported the injured Robert Zhitnyansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport, and he was under constant surveillance by Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went off without any complications.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Zhitnyansky had a serious accident in Brussels in the beginning of the summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in critical condition ever since.
After being repatriated, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jany Žitňanské from NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians join forces to fight against rescue ships of NGOs with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships bringing migrants from the Mediterranean to its shores unless the NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
If the NGOs do not sign the new code of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet over suspicions of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The charity, which has been in operation for a year, declined to comment on the matter because of the accusations made by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosiosi.
"For us, saving lives is and will always be the number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the emergency zones at the moment", the organisation said in a statement on social media.
We can comment on the current charges only after gathering all the information and assessing the situation.
Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet ship Iuventa since October.
Her crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board, handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the prosecution's file, allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, and the Italian media reported the proceedings.
The ship's crew are suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian zeal, more than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board vessels such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code so far: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS, and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter organisation said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent a 'substantial change or obstacle' to rescue operations.
The Nobel Prize winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has also refused to accept the new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, has suggested that the sharp drop in recent weeks in the number of migrants disembarking in Italy as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
In recent days, we are beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel, said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
She's got silicone and cellulite coming out of her overalls!
Hot summer days are tempting to wear only the bare necessities to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominique Mesarros does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where actors, presenters, singers and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, just swarmed, she covered her body in a mini-overall.
And with just a few normal movements, the model showed everyone her silicone but also her butt.
He'd cut her half so many times, and she'd pooped so high, she'd have to do it all the time.
She certainly didn't need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year jail term, followed by five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roye, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court on Thursday: "The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was released pending a decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in the sentence with tears in her eyes, her hands folded and her eyes pointing down.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the judge.
She ended his life to make herself feel better.
She couldn't accept her own responsibility, she said.
She didn't project any guilt.
But Carter's attorney said it was an unfortunate circumstance, one he deeply regrets.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder did not have a significant impact on her conduct.
The prosecutor read the statement of Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "I will not let a day pass without grieving the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters, and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever", the statement said.
Roy's sister Camdyne Roy testified that she was haunted by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
"Losing the man I've known since birth is a pain I'll carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no law in force that punishes a person for assisting another person to commit suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in 2014 in a car seat, carbon monoxide poisoned.
The case has garnered national attention after Carter's suicide-encouraging text messages were leaked.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care", said a text message Carter sent just two weeks before he died, while Roy was on a family vacation.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote to him, "You must do it, Conrad", and "Just turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said Carter was seeking attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case has raised many questions.
One of the people who took Carter's side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, but was acquitted two years ago.
Miss Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail".
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi, the carmaker, BMW, said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are "more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is home to BMW - considering banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will retrofit three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to meet carbon dioxide emission regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing equipment to neutralise the emissions of diesel engines is increasing, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of pampering powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in order to meet emission limits, installed software in its cars that reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but the software was deactivated under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics for Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager of Zaccheo, Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian national who is not subject to extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions limits - adding to the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.
The plane crash-landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João, in the Costa da Caparica region, about 20 miles [30 km] south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane flew over people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people on the beach were reportedly fleeing to the sea to escape danger.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl were found dead on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot", described local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them survived the crash, and the police took them away for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic even finishable?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's unbuilt, even though it was built in 1978.
Even though it's unreadable, it's constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built, even if it has a building permit.
What is this? What is this?
Yes, the D11 highway.
The construction of the next section of the tunnel was halted for at least several months by the Earth Children movement.
We Easterners get the highway in pieces, like cutting up a salami.
They'll cut the circle and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don't want to be miraculous.
We just want to reduce the travel time and we want to get the trucks going to Poland or from Poland out of the villages and towns.
Endless streams of trucks go straight through the towns of Jaroměř or Náchod, which are not to be ignored.
But so far, the last stretch of our dream highway was opened in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a peep since.
That's why when the construction of the remaining 4 kilometers of the unfinished section to the King's Castle and other sections to Jaroměra began recently, with the archaeological survey that construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear the loud beating of the spunters in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it was clear there's no building this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has broken up.
The Earth children are repeating their tactic from D1.
They're challenging the building permits in their entirety.
In the dissolution, they request a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the bodies concerned.
For example, the town hall, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Road Office.
So, we're now on our way down from D11 to a village called "The Little Climb".
So we're getting off, just driving down the freeway, and then we're suddenly on a side road, and we're preferring to line up in the queue.
The worst part is that you see stories like this all over the country.
The dreadful, constantly clogged road to Benesov, the D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own Moose.
What do the Children of Earth demand?
What are the problems with the construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually unfinished in the current system?

The Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but is now threatened by climate change.
The Levanduli are declining because of the dry climate and the harmful insects, which sends a chill down the cheeks of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: Lavender cultivation in Provence is under threat because in the last few years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
Also to blame are the cicadas and the micro-bacterial locusts that thrive in dry climates.
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender is a tourist attraction, and the oil it produces is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: 'Instead of tall and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, less.
Solutions may include more efficient water distribution and a slower evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying the lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species that are resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Riodoce staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest taking place in Sinaloa involving organized crime, corrupt officials and the ongoing drug wars.
But today, under the pressure of recent events, they're meeting primarily for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two veteran journalists discuss what would be safer: taking your children to an office that was attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to name every word - no proof is needed, just imagination and intuition.
Picking them from what - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal activity.
Violence continues and bodies are piled up across the country; journalists are increasingly being killed: at least 25 since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed this year in all seven states.
Among them is the co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his many books on the violence associated with drug trafficking.
His loss is palpable, even if his presence is omnipresent - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" pointed at the middle finger hangs on the building's facade; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - are in their 30s, wearing a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and Panama hats.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle cases of journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists has so far indicted two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and it's a very rare way for journalists' killers to be brought to justice.
The Riodoca journalists insist on reporting on the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are devastated by the grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a sense of justice, a security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
It is foolish to waste time on such meetings, he adds.
Unless we get more information, no one can be trusted.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoca headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to drive a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him from the car and killed him with 12 shots, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as Twelve Rivers.
The gunmen then boarded his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
It seems that in Culiacán, rumors spread fast.
In the case of Valdez, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is full of ornate two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of them bigger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "crucial" implies that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes by which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoc, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
She believes she contributed to his death by two mistakes.
The first was the February edition of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on Joaquin Guzmán's sons.
The peace could anger the sons; the suspected gang members had all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other newspapers that ran the same story.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as a major milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He had survived for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the periodical Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and found Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloe, 'it was impossible to do journalism without mentioning the drug trade,'said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and truthful reporting; the newspaper began to prosper.
Journalists were happy to scour the news for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous coverage of the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I feared for my life", he said when accepting the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
You have to play the role of a journalist or play the role of a fool.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff at Riodoc misses Valdez, a man known for his wit and his tongue, a good friend who loved to give advice and hugs, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the bar El Guayabo across from the office and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions in their minds about their own assumptions - how to do their job as best they could and stay alive?
They don't like you messing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret airfields.
"These things were forbidden", Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's not right, hands off.
The problem is, Riodoc editor Andres Villarreal said that "they" is a sense that can be distorted... and then there was the Javier thing.
The old rules, according to him, as well as others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as they do in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and others, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is changing all the time.
No cell phones are allowed in the room where Riodoca staff meet, as spyware was discovered a few days ago that governments have been buying to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Outside the building, two officers find relief from the 40-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, which are located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Culiacan.
Journalists wonder if these policemen are not among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials that the government says are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists have ventured into the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by the drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the murder of the brother of the former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They're also investigating suspicious government spending in the governor's home town.
Recently, there were several kidnappings at one of Culiacán's most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the District Attorney's office.
No one had officially announced the identities of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists were on their guard as they prepared to write about what every citizen in the city knew: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read public records that said restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have been recently accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked the journalists to report on previous incidents that had occurred at the restaurant, including the incident in which one of Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán's sons escaped an army response unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on kidnapping.
"Valdez would have solved the case", said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office has become a warehouse of signs and posters protesting the killing of journalists, and the staff certainly didn't expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went to the prosecutor's office the next morning to protest another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in western Michoacán.
Only a burned body was found, and authorities say DNA analysis has confirmed it's Adam's.
Activity by journalists is escalating across the country, with many organizing protests and scratching the pavements and buildings with "SOS presses".
The newspaper's editor, Bojorquez, is on a day trip to Washington, where he's trying to win international support and justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloy held the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of surveilling journalists and murdering them for reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she's requested a transfer to another department out of concern that her anger could jeopardize her neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are "chased" by organized crime, corrupt officials, and the public's indifference.
In his latest book, Narco-journalism, he writes that journalists are not only killed by drug cartels, but also by politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez added.
Murder obviously works.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who was killed six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my news".
Next to the severed head were the keyboard and earpiece.
Some branches have decided to close, such as El Norte, a newspaper based in the northern border state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of Miroslava Breach.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page article entitled "What Do You Want From Us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even crossed the border.
It's a tough call.
It's hard to find a job in exile, just like it's hard to get rid of the feeling of being constantly chased.
And journalists are being hunted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day is a risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist", he said.
It's midnight on a Friday, and Riodoc employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside the office - the latest issue has just been sent to the printer - sipping on beer when suddenly the phone rings.
They are learning that 19 people have been killed in a shootout between gang members and police officers near the beach resort town of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, as promised by the many messages left in this area by the members of the syndicate.
The journalists are publishing this news from their mobile phone on Riodoc's website.
Not a day goes by, and the headline changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens indicate another gunfire.
Bojorquez takes a quick look at the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of their newspaper's fallen co-founder - whose middle name is the eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
"How can we even think about leaving", said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out into the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Now researchers have uncovered the first findings of a remarkable creature the size of a rhinoceros, whose perfectly preserved remains - dubbed by experts the "Mona Fox of dinosaurs" - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and said that the dinosaur had a 'problematic past.'
An article in Current Biology magazine called it "the best-preserved armored dinosaur yet found and one of the finest dinosaur species in the world".
The fossil is a new species of the Nodosauridae family, a dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved state literally shocked the researchers, who described it as 'really remarkable.'
The armored white-tailed deer is the best-preserved fossil of its kind, according to National Geographic.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what appeared to be a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to shed the animal from a huge 1,100-kilogram piece of land.
When the work is complete, the dinosaur is ready to be revealed.
'Just a little squint and you'll believe it's sleeping,' said project manager Caleb Brown, a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
"It will surely go down in history as one of the most beautiful and most gifted of all dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivore - despite being covered in tannin and resembling a walking tank - was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect itself from predators and used a camouflage system that many animals use today.
Experts say this allowed it to blend in better with its surroundings and avoid enemies, and the camouflage system suggests it was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old Nodosauridae dinosaur first appeared in newspapers in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli, after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with his team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the remarkable state of preservation of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shapes of the shells and armor throughout the body.
They uncovered a method of camouflage commonly used by modern animals for defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this cloaking effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of modern animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that dinosaurs were such a prolific predator that evolution gave them the survival advantage of masking confrontation.
Many of today's masked animals - such as the deer, zebra, or the striped man - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survival.
"The prey of a huge and heavily armed dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers posed by Cretaceous predators", said Brown.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about its life, including preserved stomach contents, to locate its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a river after it died and was carried into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
The climate in Alberta was the same as it is in Florida today, and the rivers and oceans were farther inland than they are today.
'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and yet it is preserved in three dimensions and we can see its original size,' Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just close your eyes a little and it appears as if it were sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous, the Earth was roamed by giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a monster measuring 35 feet long and weighing over six tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology believe that the body of Borealopelta was washed out to sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in a mine owned by Suncor Millenium, near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, this is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, complete from snout to hip.
The animal averaged five meters in length and weighed up to 1,300 kilograms.
Two 20-inch spikes protruding from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this weedkiller roamed what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out to sea.
His undersea tomb preserved his body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armor plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, finding a well-preserved specimen is like winning the lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the findings seem.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to such an extent that the armor plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
On his side lies his right forefoot with his toes pointing upwards.
I can easily count the spades on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, Whose Streets?
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, the St. Louis native sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a post by a high school student.
Police just shot an 18-year-old whose body is still lying in the street, it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah has been constantly retweeting her posts on the wall.
A St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his thoughts on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot and killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying unrestrained on the street, where no one had picked him up after four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to get back to him the night she was following the tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
A photo of police tapes and screaming people followed, with one man claiming to be the father of the victim holding a sign that read, "Ferguson Police Killed My Unarmed Son!"
She was watching the live news - one of the policemen was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer was seen, as she said, holding a gun in his hand, pointing it at the crowd and shouting, "I'm going to kill all of you... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell said to herself.
This is not the kind of murder we're used to seeing and calling normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
I was angry and I cried.
She immediately booked a return flight and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's and decided to head to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the town of Ferguson over the next three years is told in the new documentary Whose Streets?
It's a story of survival and protest, love and hate, strength and resilience, told from the perspective of the people living in the community, who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell began a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral dress and the same floral headdress - about a topic they had discussed many times before - the experience of black people.
"Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?"
We're going to Ferguson right now because police killed an 18-year-old and it's not right.
"It was out of the question not to take her with me", Ferrell later said.
Today's events are the culmination of events that have occurred in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up with it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also to understand the difference between the different layers of the black experience and what we have to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with a condition in which she does not experience racism herself, she is no different in any way from any other black female child.
I feel that if I shield her from this experience, I would only harm her.
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road, opposite the police department, which became a base for activists awaiting word from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
It was here that Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for the others.
Together they prepared food in sacks and helped distribute it to the protesters.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly being born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th", said Ferrell, adding that while at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and worked to bring health care and food to black communities.
I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met her future co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the events taking place.
But Ferrell was wondering, are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that could be exploited?
This type of skepticism has permeated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to profit from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an un-dated interview: "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are very often ignored, and we wanted to change that".
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a well-known local artist who specializes in death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also inspired Ferrell and six other local residents who were followed by the "Whose Streets?" team in the years after Brown's murder.
"Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement", Davis said.
 It was important to me - how these people would be represented - because the same way I would be represented.
While the documentary's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an effort to show that the movement is not about a rescue leader, but about bringing the community together, Folayan said - it turned out that she was the one who was most open to being on the set.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" thus describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked", Ferrell said with a smile on her face, recalling the first time she had seen the final version of the documentary.
But I realized that in order to do this job and to be able to kiss black people, I had to open up.
Ferrell's story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created the social media campaign #BlackLivesMatter in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves queers.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the survival of the movement", said Ferrell, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black women with a quirky history have to bear the brunt of these events.
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.
He insists, however, that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and that Ferrell is not the main character of the documentary because of her views.
'It was the driving force and source of energy,' she said.
It's no coincidence that she's on the front lines, because life in these crossroads as a black woman is dangerous.
You can feel the rush of energy even in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV cameras have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking the highway during a demonstration.
The socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home has been described as "disorder".
She's never been less than the kind of person she's been committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose are our chains.
There was a field fire in Kolínska.
Dozens of firefighters were dispatched, and a helicopter was on the scene.
Near Český Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares burned since 14:00.
The fire was out of control by 3:15 p.m., and firefighters have issued a third of four possible fire alarms.
According to the spokesman of the fire department, Ladislav Holomčík, the helicopter was also used to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the fire brigade managed to put out the fire, causing damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a mechanical failure in the engine room of the combine.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter, which made a total of six water drops.
"Instead of a hit, we handed it over to the owner, who will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade until 8:00 tomorrow", said Holomčík today.
A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using DNA from Chelsea Manning
In the center of a room at New York's Friedman Gallery, there are several faces of different colors - white, black, and brown - hanging from the ceiling on wires, each one as if out of sight of the one before it.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from a scrape of her mouth and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally leaking classified cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience with technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before he left office as U.S. president.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to depict what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the malleability of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken about identifying as a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on twenty charges, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud, and theft.
All of her photographs were retained by prison staff, with only one black and white photograph of lower quality, showing Manning, visibly concerned, sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig she is now associated with, having been withheld by the prison staff.
In 2015, there was still a positive response to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create images of possible faces of these people.
And just about this time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
'They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complement the article with a portrait,' explained Dewey-Hagborg at the opening of the new exhibition.
But visits and photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and could attend the exhibition in person.
Indeed, within days of the comic's release, President Obama asked for Manning's release, a welcome change after several harrowing years in a military prison in Kansas.
It's really interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war on people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to use his tweets to incite resentment in the areas he is supposed to be promoting.
In response to questions about this peculiar timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for a reason".
Under the artist's statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls out with her huge signature (the letter i in the last name is spelled out with a heart) for an end to the self-created factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the other side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the letters C, G and A, written in pencil.
By arranging 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
'I hope people learn from this that our genome doesn't matter who we are and that genetic data is subjective and can be interpreted by anyone,' said Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells many different stories, and these are 30 of them.
The last exhibit in the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning coming out of the United States Disciplinary Barracks in King Kong style with a megaphone in her hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win", it says.
Never let yourself be silenced.
"It's a direct copy of one of the letters", said the Philadelphia artist.
♪ When I think of it, my skin gets goose bumps. ♪
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic - but when she does, she will be greeted in the center of the room by her masks, her genomic portraits, lined up like a mob of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibit, including a nearly five-foot statue of Maning, with her genetic haplogroups written on it in pencil.
'In the past they have been placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel crowded,' Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement taking the form of Chelsea and liberating her.
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employees who are being investigated on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for men named Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranlea, according to Cook County court records.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died of multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police say the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Police were alerted to the incident by phone, and upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with multiple stab wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has served as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president for public affairs, said in an e-mailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been barred from the university's campus.
The whole matter is now being investigated by the appropriate authorities and Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,said Cubbage.
Warren is the executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have been contacted by the British police and are ready to assist the US police as well".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the incident and wanted him to turn himself in to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department's public relations director, said he was calling on the suspects to turn themselves in to the proper authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and are intensifying their search for suspects", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the superintendent of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were about to take place in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's unclear if the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim", Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza officials have issued a statement to all residents: "Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence".
In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not be long before the remaining WADA criteria were implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was re-established.
 At present, part of the criteria for the new plan have been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, the WADA plan was updated, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the code - which outlines the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutka, the codex contains nothing that should concern Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for the public release of the results of the WADA investigation, led by Richard McLaren, into the alleged government sponsorship of Russian athletes' doping.
Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system has clearly failed.
All precautions have been taken.
But there were no government programs in our country, so we can't admit to something that never existed.
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with RSport Russia, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept the message completely without reservations", Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Russia of conducting internal doping controls in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation allowed the planning and consolidation of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organisation's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was 'on the right track' to be re-established.
The police have charged three people, one of them a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with starting the fire Wednesday at a rare wooden church in Trinc-Gutech, Frýdecko-Místeck.
One of the accused is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of public endangerment.
This was stated to the press today by the Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel.
He said it was a premeditated crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter", Kužel said.
He said the police will be discussing the possible detention of the accused.
The Director said that no further information could be disclosed.
"I can't say more because the criminal police and the prosecutor are working on the case", Kužel said.
The wooden Church of the Body of God in Gutech dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable memorial with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The damage is estimated to be in the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was considered for renovation.
Most of the costs are covered by insurance, but the other costs are shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, and a public collection is being prepared, with the contribution of the owner of the monument, the local parish.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Krażowa, built in the 16th century, was also destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a fault in the electrical system.
An exact replica was built in its place.
The state counts on its citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
The objective of the law on the readiness of citizens for the defence of the state includes financial support for associations useful for the defence of the state, voluntary shooting training or a team of training instructors.
The Ministry of Defense, which was given the task of processing it by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their capabilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
It's from a draft prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were to be passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defense.
The basic objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the military service and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the State would support the amateur radio, shooting, or horsemanship clubs financially or materially, and enable their members to improve their skills.
In return, it would receive data on the number of people willing to come to the country to help in times of crisis, and their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
It also includes organizing fights with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option is to create a new office to handle the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the declaration of a state of emergency.
'The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats,' the intention states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that the focus should therefore be on supporting the widest range of capabilities, not just military.
"The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond in a qualified manner to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or contribute to the protection of others, and not to make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to carry out their tasks by misbehaving", the plan states.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
The amount of the allowance will depend on the variant chosen by the Ministry.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, it could cost around CZK 60 million per year to operate.
The rest of the money would go to payroll or to build an information system.
The proposal also envisages that the territorial military commands would have to be expanded to employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union's directive on gun ownership.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups that will help your company avoid the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction rate of her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find a relevant survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And even though she promised anonymity to the investigation, some of the staff expressed their distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity", said Errett, owner of San Francisco-based hair-care e-commerce company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New startups in the human resources industry are constantly emerging in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee engagement, startups enable companies to conduct rapid voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass their superiors and contact the CEO directly.
"There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that thanks to Glin, she had gained a greater awareness of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting for specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a running overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing users to work towards a fix.
Companies are starting to realize the need to care about workplace culture - in case they become another Uber - which is being swept up in scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the company environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research presents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the technical and financial advancement website Let's Talk Payments, the global control, regulation and compliance industry could be worth over $118.8 billion by 2020.
A Denver, Colorado startup called Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect misconduct, saw a small surge of interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandal.
Convercent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, he's also taken Uber under his wing.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable flash surveys, gather confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
If the Director-General is involved, complaints are sent directly to the Administrative Board.
"The court of public opinion has empowered regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the startup Convercent.
If a company is found to have misused its employees or engaged in unethical behavior - and if regulators don't step in - it could face costly consequences from customer boycott, staff attrition or litigation, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to raise employees' awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he had to look up a phone number or e-mail address for the company's management, formally file a complaint, and hope for a successful resolution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative for Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now, when a company uses Convercent, it's able to quickly detect and resolve issues that were never before addressed by managers sitting in offices, miles away from actually addressing complaints - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment.
'It's closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,' said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management oversight group.
At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees.
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following the collapse of Enron in a case of employee ethics abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until social media took over the business that companies started to realize that in the online world, they couldn't just hide their skeletons in the closet.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on beliefs", added Quinlan.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which the companies pay regular fees.
It's a business model and opportunity that's endorsed by the venture capitalists who backed both startups.
Convercent raised $10 million in its February campaign from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and ultimately took $47 million in equity.
Glint raised $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and has raised $60 million over the course of the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interplay between companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, it's not the high salaries and interesting projects that are the main advantage.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated and that they are giving their time to a company that is pursuing a positive mission.
"When people are happy in their work, feel that their voices are heard, and feel that their work is rewarding, they are driving the success of the company", said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies are doing well, and companies thrive when their employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool is introduced that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no surprise that there are plenty of investors who will support that effort.
According to experts in work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But data alone is useless unless the company takes the necessary action.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if change doesn't happen quickly - in the worst case scenario - it can cause frustration and disengagement among employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has seen many companies rely too heavily on data alone.
Because when you don't get things done, employees start to wonder, did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'
Madison Reed, which now conducts a monthly employee survey, can solve the problem in a day, Errett said, thanks to Glinto.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and poor communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and initiate communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining very important insight into its employees and hopes that in the long run it will achieve high employment in a field known for frequent layoffs.
'If you don't work to create a transparent working environment, employees won't trust you,' Vitrano added.
And once you start losing employees, you're going to lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.
Thursday became the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnica in Hodonín.
It surpassed Tuesday, which had been the hottest day of the year, with a record high of 37.3 degrees.
The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute reported this.
But there were many temperature records that were not broken on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The storm hit mainly Morava, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring more than 30 years.
Only nine long-term measurement stations recorded the record on Thursday.
For example, in the Watchtower, today's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Břeclavska, today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Brno, Pohořelice, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with the Sentinel, date back to 2013.
High temperatures have been reported today, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
The highest temperature recorded by the police was in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brodě nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees simultaneously, but the record was not broken.
By contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, the highest temperature so far today has been only about 22 degrees Celsius, according to the CME website.
"The temperature in the area began to rise later this afternoon", the weather service said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually decrease, according to the CWMA, and on Sunday there could be more significant rain.
But in most parts of Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the south-east of Moravia on Saturday.
We've had a little trouble.
Billionaires don't have enough of one vote in the same election as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as insolent as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penty, Marek Dospiva, along with his other colleagues Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors the Robejškov Realists.
Second Life is financed by the Civic Democratic Alliance, which is headed by insurance company owner and real estate developer Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has bought the Party of the Private.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrey Babiš's project was inadvertently named by Mayor Jaroslav Nemiec of Pomeranian Ridge, is a chapter unto itself.
The Mayor's got his billionaire recently.
My name is Dalibor Dedek, owner of the Jablotron security company.
By his own words, he's entering politics to do good.
But the mayor's costume entrance was not a big success for Djedk.
"I never dreamed of small goals", he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is for the YES movement, the Mayor's movement to get 20 percent in the election.
Everyone was smiling.
But Grandfather's name is a figure of speech.
Billionaire Dalibor Dedeck is a man of his own ideas.
Although he intends to contest for the votes of the voters in the Mayor's uniform, he continues to support Andrey Babiš.
Grandpa supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a sharp orator and does not master the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes", he wrote about him before the 2013 elections.
But he's definitely not going into politics to make himself better.
I think Grandma's going to be a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which he controls, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new addition, he expressed his admiration for Granny again.
And he said he wanted the mayors to learn to envision a possible collaboration with the Granny.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his opinions and sticks to his own no matter what uniform he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Grandma sends someone so clumsy to the mayor's office to build her little house.
Others may wonder if the head of Jablotron and the head of Agrofertu have parted ways in a business dispute and are looking for other ways to defend themselves against their business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearance wasn't just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send the Mayors ten million crowns for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, such a statement would have been hard to resist.
By the way, the convicted thug Zdeněk Bakala, before the 2010 election, threw millions at all parties.
The political division of the Vit Barta security agency, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats together came to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
If the Kid's going into politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
Then perhaps he wouldn't have to ask why our politician has such a bad reputation.
In his first days in politics, Dedeck crowned a bill to tax incentives for families with educated children.
People with college degrees come in at about 50,000 a month.
I'm basing them on less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich by the standards of this country.
The one with the poor 20.
In the heir-ship vision, the poor pay their taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, which they do not participate in.
The rich simply need to be helped so that they do not suffer poverty.
Mayors congratulate each other on their new acquisition and the Grandmothers shake hands.
Thanks to Dedeck, we can all confirm that billionaires are not always nice people.
Then there's the question of who to vote for.
I'd say those who know the rules of the game and want to play by them.
Those who do not regard party members or citizens of the state as their employees and the land as their property.
And finally, those who want to make sure that in a rich country, all people live well, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be cut by 234 million.
Selling real estate is not always easy.
And often, it's not the 11 bedrooms, the beautiful ocean views, or the fact that the property is being sold by U.S. President Donald Trump.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex was sold, the price dropped by an incredible £8 million.
He reported it to Mirror.co.uk.
The land brochure says, "Welcome to the home of Donald J. Trump".
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's connection to the American president didn't justify the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean estate by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
So even after the discount, the villa complex is worth about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's no wonder why.
The stunning five-acre estate on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, numerous dining rooms, a gymnasium, and other facilities.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of trees planted on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price was driven by the fact that the president's connection wasn't enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
It's been speculated that he paid around £15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
But with the new price, it's in second place.
The property next door was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end the two-a-day practice.
It's nearly 11 a.m., and the UCLA football team is huddled at the sidelines of the new campus field.
Some of them are taking off their jerseys and revealing their sweaty backs, a sure sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of inactivity make up for the lunch break.
The players enrolled in the summer semester will go to their dorms after three hours of practice to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will take place at 6:30 a.m. the following morning.
"These guys are gonna have a tough next three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's jump to Tuesday.
By eliminating two practices in one day, the NCAA wants to relieve the players - paradoxically, it makes the practice days even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA practices are scheduled for 7:15 - to fit into the already crowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in six seasons as Westwood's head coach, Mora's training camp starts a week earlier than last year and the summer training camp is limited to one day.
Eighteen practices are scheduled to be completed by August 20th, when formal preparations begin for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
Mora has made it clear that he supports the NCAA's decision, even as he added another item to an already overwhelming player roster.
"Three or four days are very stressful for the players and it's very exhausting for them", Mora said.
But no one gave up, they're all trying.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.
UCLA will be shut down after the end of training camp, which will not be easy considering the clear line of surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel occupied by players after the safety net behind the goal posts was folded.
Bruins players are supposed to be booked into the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms empty out during the season, there could be a problem.
"The property will be guarded by security", added Mora.
The security is very good, but it's not impossible that someone could rent a room and record our training.
This stuff is a good deal.
Fortunately, the hotel will have security, as will the number eight parking lot.
We'll make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will work out.
It's all planned.
Facebook plans to tighten fact-checking to reduce the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially false articles to third-party reviewers and display findings under original posts in an effort to combat so-called "fake news", the largest social network said Thursday.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, send it to third parties for verification, and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been called one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election for president of the United States.
Political debates are raging across Europe: French voters are being inundated with fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to fine the social media network before the September elections if it does not remove angry posts quickly.
Facebook said in a further statement issued in Germany on Thursday that it was going to start testing the new fake news feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In addition to seeing third-party verified news, people are demanding more content to be better informed and to make informed decisions about what to share, said Sara Su, Facebook's product manager for news, in a blog post.
She added that Facebook was continuing to test the "Related Articles" feature and was also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news stories.
The Making of a Graphic Novel: The Story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently featured in a music video by Squeeze and was a refuge for Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s and 1980s.
But from his cozy little hideaway on the River Bewl in Kent, England, Scotney witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history that inspired curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire, known for his fondness for historical documents, to create a graphic novel.
"The sight of the handwriting of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me", says Rhodes with a serious face.
When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was struck by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites", he said.
It's his fingerprints!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read them.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm going back in time.
How I love the archives!
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyenas' heads on the wall and bottles that had been thrown down the pit for centuries.
He would walk around the grounds and examine the ruins of the old castle, talking to the haymakers, the gardeners, and sometimes the artists who were working on the illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and salsa at night.
Scotney's private history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on the scene ten years later, the staff were just beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words like aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands in the air, with the words, "Take it to the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of property: "You may think a land dispute is boring", Rhodes said, "but I've come across one case where two families argued over a birch tree.
Stop it, people!
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was in a book called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex", Rhodes said.
The English rebellion actually started in this area and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're related after all.
Other stories are firmly tied to the castle's history - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was only discovered years later after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes's favorite family is the Darrell family: I was fascinated by the male generation - men were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn't afford.
The Darrells' various generations have dealt with this by marrying wealthy or old ladies - I imagine handsome gentlemen who liked to bash the heads of their heiresses.
With his stay at the castle over, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he was drawing inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that has been swallowed up by nature.
But for Scotney, it's a special place.
"I was sad when I left", he said.
I thought, "Now I'm going to get back to the real world".
Washington changes the terms of the green card
The media has reported President Donald Trump's comments about a new US immigration plan that will include changes to the green card process.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 a year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are being proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will be presented to Congress soon.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
The new application process will prioritize English-speaking applicants who have the financial resources and demonstrated skills that will benefit our country, Trump said, as quoted by the media.
Sex robots are on the rise - we should be on our guard
Just when it seemed 2017 couldn't get any more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots pops up on the Internet.
Yes, you did.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their warts, and the shape of their robot nails.
'People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we have to be prepared to see them more and more,' said Sharkey when the report was published.
Modern sex aids are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior is a given.
The user can 'direct' the robot to his or her image - from the colour of the eyes and the shape of the nipple to the shape and colour of the nails.
What is most disturbing is that many of the robots have their own personalities, which would be embarrassing to the Stepford Lady.
Modern puffballs have evolved into silicone-skinned robotic women.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his surrogate wife up with a variety of character traits, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including "Frigid Farrah" who is noted for her shy nature and "Wild Wendy" with her "adventurous" nature.
"Roxxy Gold's personality is set to match your personality to the fullest extent possible", says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or in a bad mood.
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - not least because of the substitution of real interpersonal relationships for the more subservient female character traits and violent overtones - such as frigid (read: defiant) Farrah.
True Companion, on their website, liken Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" It says on the page.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication points to something darker and more deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or gender equality toward a desire for compulsive sex with optional overlays.
Most men will not buy a robot wife, of course, and while the FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringe of the general public's interest.
But this marginal interest can become a mirror set to the present modern times.
And most people aren't weird or violent until they're given a pretext by the free market.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are coming to life at a time when women around the world are fighting for their rights and in the White House there is a president who is speaking in terms that are often highly offensive to women.
The most terrifying aspect of the Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - the hanged bodies and gouged out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots are to be as similar as possible to real women (albeit to the extent of porn actresses).
Their designers design them to be pleasant to the touch and to look like a real woman at first glance.
But when it comes to their personality, a robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no jobs, no history, nothing to encourage their independence or to undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
The language of the 21st century: servants.
The NBA star on the green.
Curry's fighting for the California cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry, despite a botched first down on his first start, has not lost his place among the golfing pros.
The two-time NBA MVP has played in the Web.com Tour's Ellie Mae Classic in Hayward, California, and will be fighting for the first round cut by 74 runs.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started off very nervous and his first shot ended up in the cup holder of a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as he was under a basketball hoop, but he still left a dozen pros behind him with a balance of four shots above par.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a little bit too much", Curry said, with a huge three-pointer on his head.
It was very nerve-wracking, firing the first shot of the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
"If you had told me I would have had a 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately", he added.
If Curry can fight a cut that's likely to be set two strokes short, he'll be the first non-athlete to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the fear, I hope I can", said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in the past in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional competitions.
He's starting in Hayward for the first time in a PGA event.
To attend the Ellie Mae Classic, he gained a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one ranked event below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
By contrast, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable sign of the Trump era is the political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro scale, that are also tearing apart entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American press was flooded with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be waiting for him to get mad.
Less attention has been paid to Trump's ability to raise a family.
I mention it because I had a visit this week in New York from my cousin, a poet and a left-wing fan living in Chicago who has long been a Republican douchebag in our family.
She reminded me that face-to-face with a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the entire family - including all the Republican siblings she's been bickering with about politics for years - is on the same page.
This is a good thing when we have a family dinner; but it strikes me that in a larger context, this poses a significant risk.
Trump is empowering the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the terrifying possibility that his antics may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more horrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, in defiance of his standards, will suddenly be the embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these days with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy deal - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax returns) - both of which seem like very mild excesses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, all it takes is for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which would be a huge improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park on the largest merry-go-round operated by the New York Parks Department -- you can't do three dollars better than that, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center wheel is covered with laminated glass - the clowns and animals are turning and looking at their shoulders in horror - a totally gloomy look and a squeaking music that strangely resembles public transport.
Many clichés soon become boring: the view from the towers, the panorama is suffocating instead of breathing on you, and the reality of the city is not in your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still haven't moved past the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not counting the themed tavern Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but a London Underground station.
But the carousel in Central Park is a remarkably magical experience, to the point that two two-year-olds can have a great time on it, as well as two grown women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would earn maximum points, but fortunately, no one asks.
I had a similar experience this week at the store when I was asked to rate my savings on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, except I can add 15% of a tip to the appraisal for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only is it slowed down by the normally fast-paced sales, but the waitress is forced to intrude on the favor of shoppers when she doesn't need to.
The woman at the store smiled and apologized when I reluctantly gave my credit card five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pains
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrists, which the prison said he had inflicted on himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal against the original death sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the door of a toilet cabinet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he had mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and a trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces a sentence of up to 15 years.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.
For the first time in history, a captive panda has given birth to a cub mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The Center is working to expand the captive panda gene pool.
A worker at the Chang Chi-chung Center told the New China News Agency that the panda breed is at great risk from inbreeding.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas were in captivity.
Only 2,000 of them survive in the wild.
The effort to pair captive pandas with wild ones is the first step in helping the breeding panda protect the species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the reserve at the start of the panda's mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device around her neck, scientists could monitor her every move.
Twelve days later, Cchao-chao met her chosen one.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, for male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
The males have a pretty poor idea of when the female is ready, and they're often confused and unsure of what to do.
The cub was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams at birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonia police in the early hours of 1 August.
All were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping and are imposing severe fines on anyone caught camping in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will be running all season.
The Ministry stated that the court could impose a fine.

The Kingsbarns, Scotland, outfield was bypassed by a one-stroke under par, when she made three birdies and two bogeyes.
The 22-year-old Czech player is hoping to make her first cut on the famous major.
The entry for the $3.25 million purse was bested by American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in a field record 64 runs, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which according to it means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are faultless.
The Authority stressed that the risk is represented by only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Petr Majer, a spokesman for the Czech SVS, said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also closed farms, had not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, the veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where the insecticide-containing problematic marks have been found on the market.
According to the Veterinary Administration, the last time an egg from Belgium was on the Czech market was in April and the last time an egg from the Netherlands was on the Czech market was in May.
Chicken meat from Belgium was last seen in the Czech Republic in June.
But there's some Dutch chicken in the Czech Republic.
Fipronil is a substance used in flea, tick and worm products.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is intended for human consumption.
The World Health Organisation considers the preparation to be moderately toxic.
Its high doses lead to nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss it, says the goalkeeper.
I'd like to get 10 more years.
"Maybe I'll go back one day", said the 27-year-old farmer, who could start the season in a leather outfit.
It depends on whether he gets a contract by the start of the new term.
How were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as a school, it's three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was studying.
The second year I started catching.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, and I took turns with him again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But we had scored maybe five points in the first ten games, so the coaches started to shoot.
My partner caught more at the end.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to keep it for next season.
How was life in Risa?
It's wonderful.
It's a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We've been together for three years. We're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How hard is the NHL for goalies?
The top ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slavs, who have to change their style of play against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see the problem with the width of the field.
The difference is, the Russians want to play to the empty.
They shoot less, and even when they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to shoot.
There's more shooting in the Czech Republic.
You didn't have a problem with traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
Most of the schedule is made up of you playing maybe four games outdoors and then you're off for two days.
How do Latvians even perceive their club in the KHL?
Like the national team.
All of Latvia is watching hockey, it's the national sport along with basketball.
Fans all over the place.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people did.
Did Dinamo's presence in the KHL help Latvia almost reach the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been around since 2008, and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from that same time, their World Championship scores started to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they lost in the quarterfinals to Canada, 1-2.
It was an unrealistic result for them.
The KHL has taken them to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts has won the election and before signing the contract, Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many come here?
They're not the best players, they're the best.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are one of them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still out of work?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Rize.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have the budget for a goalie, we didn't make the deal.
Then it was a classic.
We've played with different teams, but in the final they chose someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come along.
Doesn't that make you nervous?
That was me four years ago, when I left here, not knowing what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand I'm home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How realistic is the option that you will start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it all comes out.
Now I can only wait to hear what the agent has to say.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season was not one of those things where I had a choice.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government's flight to the flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote an article on the care of a proper householder, which included a camp in Letech near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me quote the key passages of the article.
The Letech camp has been talked about for years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best to take a look at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp, and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including the inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were placed in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4th, 1943, the largest transport to the death camp was 370 people.
There were 420 in all.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, caused by human beings and by perverted ideology.
There is no question that these events need constant reminding.
There is no question that the commemoration should take place at the memorial at the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
Under socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pigsty was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy the pig farm and demolish it, but that has not happened yet.
In 1998, the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration has been under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pork.
So many very brief facts about the camp's post-war fate.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pigs and decided to have an expert opinion be drawn up to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy the pigs.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably ruin the plans if I went public with them".
We'll see what the expert's report says.
Some unofficial estimates put the cost at hundreds of millions, while others put the cost at billions.
Either way, it's not going to be a cheap affair.
Yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, for which the state invested nearly ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is unlikely, I still think it would be a waste of money.
Don't the government have other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can pay homage to the memory of those who suffered and were killed.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it at that, and maintain the sanctuary with the utmost care.
The person responsible for the trust, in this case the government of the Czech Republic, should be a proper steward of the trust's assets, including taxpayers' money.
At least as much as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement as an empty pre-election proclamation.
This May, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, converted parking lot, replica wooden camp houses.
In one exhibit, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with seating and a view of its own pit, created by stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All the attributes that fit the significance of this place, how it should be and belong.
Archaeological research is currently being conducted at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to preserve part of the exposed foundations and to make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is where the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, could be focusing his efforts.
If he succeeds in getting the government to buy the pigs with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic function as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy, and chocolate may alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study suggests the opposite: A diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
An incurable disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the United Kingdom, it causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhoea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are usually reminded to avoid meat and dairy products to help relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan found in protein helps to form immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, who led the study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes in food are eliminated.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales are tilted to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the study, researchers found the presence of immune cells that promote body tolerance in the stomachs of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between a species of bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a common part of the gut microbiome, and the development of cells that support the body's tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells they had.
He also suggested that if the same proved true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could help develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in studying a type of immune cell that promotes body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice kept separately lacked cells.
She deduced that one group of mice had a distinct gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were tested by DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the other group of mice lacked.
Mice that were raised in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome -- they didn't develop that kind of immune cell -- were given L. reuteri bacteria -- and they developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After the active substance was removed from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-octanoic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent, while the number of cells decreased by half when they halved the tryptophan doses.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the tryptophan by-products of L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but tryptophan-related gene defects have been identified in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells, since they control the inflammation of the inner lining of the intestine.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase cell population.
José Mourinho considers the signing of Neman Matic and his move to Manchester United to be 'genius'.
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in Nemanja Matic - at least that's what Jose Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matić, who signed for £40 million, made his debut in a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season game before United's UEFA Super Cup clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a back-up alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he did not take part in the team's pre-season tour of Asia, Matić was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks football", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get back in shape as soon as possible.
Like Matić, his new team-mates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his starting XI for the next season.
An independent source this week said that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done a "fantastic job" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players", he added.
I'd have liked four out of four more, but I'll admit they did the best they could for me.
The challenge of a lifetime for the king of the chicken skins, Lada Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture has begun to emerge thanks to the new TV show Prima Zdenekova Akademy.
The peacock jumped at the chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because, I think I can learn a lot from you", he said in a video posted on social media.
And since the two have been spying on each other for years, Lada didn't forget to provoke him this time.
"In return, I can teach you the sweetness of diet chicken, American cucumbers, or I can take you out for a drink and show you why fried cheese is popular", grumbled the Mouse.
He's really serious about being on Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say", said Lightning.
Pohlreich didn't comment because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!
Only Prima responded to the participation of the pear in the culinary academy by saying that he takes the whole thing as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hruška Pohlreich was dealt a big blow in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new show that Prima announced at the press conference for the fall broadcast schedule yesterday is the real cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his students from the audience and introduces them to 12 cooking techniques in 12 episodes.
In the final episode of the show, Now the Chef Cooked in November 2014, Zdeněk had a pear with a cross on the back of his shirt.
If he had my face on it, I'd be laughing.
"I'm laughing at the pear - it's a healthy fruit and has lots of vitamins", Lada said.
Lada's cooking is a little bit of a joke.
"Cooking like Lada Pears is out of the question at home, because I'm not going to let gastropunk in my house", the boss says.
I respect the Zdenek Pohlreich very much, I even make a honey chicken according to him.
But his recipes are definitely not going to be on my show", he didn't forgive Hruška.
He's such a jerk!
He's not a chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomically illiterate or moronic", Pohlreich said of Hruška at one of his lectures.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore", said Hruška, referring to the insults he had received.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock cars and houses by waving
A British inventor has become the first person in the country with a microchip implanted in his body, which can unlock the doors of his home and office with a simple wave of his hand, and even start his car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger, and he now offers the same service through his company, BioTeq, to companies and individuals who want to use technology to make their lives easier.
The implantation procedure and follow-up are supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's also offers a service to replace door locks and microchip-compatible cars at a cost of £300 per lock.
A married father of one has had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he can start with a simple wave of the hand.
The White House acquisition cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn to celebrate American manufacturing industry last month came at a cost of $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, with the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 White House program, a showcase of American engineering programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were in attendance to view the product line from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was displayed alongside a Maine yacht, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a Fragmentary Order, or FRAGO, requesting the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn in an "emergency" event, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for managing the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event", the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an email to his superior, the Deputy Commander of Naval Aviation, the day before the event began.
The message indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn on July 17th at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m., and would remain in place until the entire site was cleared, which was scheduled to take place between 6:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement flight crew would be sent for the return flight due to the work schedule.
The original crew stayed in place that night with the helicopter and a security detail with them.
The recordings - obtained by TIME magazine - did not reveal whether a second crew was sent in after all.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if this was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was in order", the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you've been blocked", replied the deputy commander.
This "Made in America" parade was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political undertones.
In his speech, the president championed health care reform that had passed the Senate and spoke of trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of air transportation vehicles like Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence for presentational purposes alone is unusual.
Trump ordered the sweep in February after the presidential plane flew in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is pleased to host a 'Made in America' showcase of products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials", said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often practice landing in the Washington area and South Lawn and rehearse possible flights with the President of the United States to the White House with the utmost precision.
While Trump was in Germany for the G-20 summit in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 practice landings at the White House.
The Made in America parade flight was part of the crew's current training, a state official said.
The helicopter squadron flew another 11 hours of non-presidential support missions that same day.
The White House said no other taxpayer-funded props were paid for.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had no interest whatsoever in the talks to put the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 doesn't keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, reimbursing DoD for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit logs show a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico, Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopters are well below that amount.
To quote the cost to taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement of expenditure is very misleading, Walters said.
These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.
The 2015 RAND study shows that DoD's reimbursement of expenses does not include personnel costs, but does include fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time, White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for the parade.
"The idea of the show this week is to showcase products made in the U.S"., Spicer said.
I'm aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide employment to hundreds if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we're proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens have helped to build.
This fact deserves to be remembered.
It's unclear whether Trump also looked at the helicopter during his tour of the South Lawn, but all we can say for sure is that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump approached a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well", said the President, "and I own three of them".
A young woman is stranded in a swamp near Lake Magnolia, and the police are on their way.
The girl left for the beach on Sunday at about 2:00 a.m.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the swamp.
When she decided to use her cell phone to call the police for help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her", said police spokeswoman Ivana Balakova.
Several police patrols were dispatched to the area she roughly described, but finding the young woman was no easy task.
"Some of the officers had to walk hundreds of yards through the reed bogs before they could feel the solid ground under their feet", Balakova said.
And similar to that, she was missing.
The officers were guided by the direction of her cry for help.
"To avoid losing this connection, they agreed to let her count down aloud", the spokeswoman said.
The police found the woman at a quarter to five in the swamps of Borny.
She was at the edge of her physical and mental powers, and she was showing signs of hypothermia.
So the ambulance that was called took her to the hospital in Českolip.
Santa's going to STAN?
The bride-to-be becomes a prostitute.
That's a little ironic.
His web project searchlusny.cz as if the billionaire was basically telling the voters that STAN suffers from a shortage of decent people.
And he also argued that the politically uncoordinated party of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national program for the House elections.
Her candidate for the election will simply become a decent person, whatever his political views, after an interview with the Godfather.
This is how Victor Bart started, and it didn't end well.
By attacking decent people and personalities who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, as Gazdík admitted, Dědek also cancels the favorite argument of the STAN chief, that the greatest value of the movement is the politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians according to polls.
They're now being quietly replaced by hastily assembled unknown personalities.
The total break with the populists, after which STAN changed the logo and the slogan, Gazdík also explained by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity to the populist candidates.
But if STAN suspected few people of identity then, with Santa's arrival, the whole identity game is over.
Gazdík has long been opposed to ANO Andreje Babiš, but at the first joint press conference, Dedek, who publicly praises Babiš, stated as follows: "My goal is for the ANO movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, to gain twenty percent in the upcoming elections".
Let's hope you didn't get the wrong move.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and billionaire is no accident.
He often talks about politics like Granny, but unlike Granny, he doesn't have a political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been more like a reality show than a real political party, and Dedock's helping hand seemed to make the bride-to-be even more of a sell-out girl.
For a while, Stan went with the Top 09, then the People, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police dogs were practicing in the Bridge over the River by helicopter.
Explosives and search dogs were practicing at Bridge Over The River today.
Police dogs should not be timid and afraid of flying, said Petr Tomášek, head of police cynologists in the Ústí Region.
Police dog training takes about two years.
Both adult trained dogs and those just beginning to walk were trained at the Bridge.
In addition to the standard training of detecting sharp explosive samples around the lake and searching for a missing figurant, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work, so that he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter's route.
"The helicopter arrives, the dog goes and immediately looks", said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start work immediately after a helicopter trip is disqualified from training.
"They usually keep them for their dogs, for example, in the garden", added Tomášek.
The police in the Usti region have 76 dogs with different specialties.
The German Shepherds are dominant, but the Belgian Shepherds are also increasing.
The dog handler's been taking care of him since he was a puppy.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service the dog will do for us", Tomášek added.
The animal shall undergo repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unruly, the first test is taken at 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get into the acute intervention", added Tomášek.
The length of service at the police station depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve eight to ten years.
They spend most of their time with their owners.
Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the picture and the Cali Cartel is the center of the hit Netflix series
Despite the season two finale of Narcos, which revealed Pablo Escobar's killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has confirmed the third and fourth seasons - the first one has already seen the first trailer and a cast of other villains.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: the Cali Cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate like a Fortune 500 company, only with the added violence and bribery of more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the mastermind of the operation, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection to Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement officers in the war on drugs.
Other actors who have appeared in the film include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé, and Arturo Castro.
Narcos season three will premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the UN relief mission's lead official, said hundreds of women are participating in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
The role of women cannot be overlooked, he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as in all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan are scheduled for April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the election process, which is putting international fighting on the back burner.
This year's election marks the first time a democratically elected government has handed power to a peaceful successor.
Haysom said that a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission said that 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters were women.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery back to life a few years ago in Lobca u Mšena.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted to a steam-powered operation in the 19th century.
Years of prosperity followed, with the brewery becoming known for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during World War II, and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served as state property.
The brewery owners did the damage after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and torn apart for building material.
In 2007, however, new hope was born in the form of new owners, architects Janna and Pavel Prouz.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have been diligent in studying archival material, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery looks exactly as it did in the 19th century, when its golden age began.
Their work was awarded the brewery's cultural heritage status by the Ministry of Culture, and the building was also included in the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, they also celebrated the revival of the brewing tradition.
To taste the excellent Lobeč beer in the picturesque Kokořínska landscape, visit the tap at the brewery premises.
The brew uses water from the springs in the protected landscape, malt from the fields of Lobeč and hops from the Zatec region.
In the cellar, you'll find traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, held on Saturday and Sunday at noon and 2:30 p.m.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest forts of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique construction was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and Žacléř, on top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babi.
Originally, it was to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected by extensive underground tunnels.
It was supposed to be a headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, supplies, a power plant, an engine room and a hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, the only massive concrete bunker was built, and the underground chambers were dug.
Thanks to the enthusiastic Stachelberg Group, who began to reconstruct the unique structure in the early 1990's, you too can see it.
The basement is already 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry hut with exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification object, two dismantled infantry huts, trenches and the educational path of the Fortified Trutnovsko.
A refreshment, a cosy gazebo, and a breathtaking view of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and magnificent Czech structure has been listed alongside such landmarks as the Great Wall of China, the Port of Trajan in Rome, and the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrod.
The monastery of Chotesov originally from the early thirteenth century, which today mainly consists of a huge four-winged convent building over a magnificent garden.
A list he's gotten on, but unfortunately, it's a list of unique structures that are in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts don't give up and they organize a lot of events to support the monastery.
One of them is the next edition of the Evening for the Monastery of Chotěšov on Saturday, August 5th, where the mayor Vladimir Mišík, Ivan Hlas, will perform, you will see swordplay performances and you will see the places of the magnificent sprawling buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to see the face of a Neanderthal?
The exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals in the Anthropos pavilion of the Moravian Land Museum in Brno invites you to an unusual excursion to the deepest prehistory, to the Stone Age, to the world of our ancestors.
You'll see how the Neanderthals were able to perfectly cope with all kinds of extreme climatic conditions, especially the alternation of the ice ages and the interglacials.
Despite their simple material culture, they were hugely successful predators of their time.
You'll also learn what they looked like, what their anatomy was, their technological skills and hunting skills, but also their aesthetic sense.
Wouldn't you say that to a Neanderthal?
Let Brno see you.
The 14th KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival is being held on Saturday the 5th at Vever Castle.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Both students of herbalism and plant lovers will benefit from the new free Pl@ntNet application.
When they're curious about what plant they just encountered on their walk, these apps will tell them.
All they have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the app will recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Horský Park in Bratislava as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
The project also involved pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who took photographs and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The new French app is free to download from the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was to have as many people as possible contribute their images to the application, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who have a tablet or a mobile phone in their hand can now go into the forest", said Ivana Poláčková, the project coordinator.
Based on a high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can recognize the name of the plant in a matter of seconds, which it then applies to the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that users contribute a photo of a plant not yet present in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is useful, and then add it to the database", Polkovacka reported.
GMB's concerns about investing in the McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie's of a long-term commitment to manufacture in the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent for the time being on any investment in a factory in the Tollcross area.
The factory employs over 500 workers, who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea, among other products.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, stated that it had invested over £5 million in the whole area over the previous few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be among the first to be informed of any changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the construction company, the Scottish GMB unions expressed their concern that McVitie's would not deliver on its promises to finance and modernise the production lines.
GMB's chief organiser, Drew Duffy, added: 'The fact that we have not received a clear response from the developer about the company's needs and future investment plan at Tollcross is very concerning to our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the staff are mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work in the local factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social isolation.
In terms of jobs, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and slowing manufacturing - East Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturer like McVitie's.
A Pladis spokesperson said: The CEO of Tollcross only received the letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
The regular meeting of GMB employees and representatives at Tollcross two months ago was a very open meeting on many issues.
We have talked to our employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: "In recent years we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, mainly in production lines and efficiency.
We have great respect for the heritage of Tollcross and the local area and in the event of any change in the operation of the factory here, the employees and union representatives will be informed immediately.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
The league may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint-Germain won't let go of its attempt to get Neymar on their side after they paid £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but warned this French team Barcelona of their record-breaking run three years ago?
This sensational move has stirred the waters of summer transfer fees, as the Ligue 1 club is set to more than double the previous record transfer fee of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, who paid £89 million for him last season.
After the transfer is confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation, he will receive over £500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona are furious at the way Neymar has walked away from his contract, despite an insider confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since he arrived from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in signing one of PSG's best players.
"I'm not afraid because if someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely approach one of their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face the consequences.
Barcelona seem to have crossed the line when they expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill for their audacious actions with Neymar's departure.
Who's going to explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has been waving anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And just the day before, Trump tweeted that China is doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it won't continue to be that way.
It's like the idea of sanctions is just a fig.
You can't throw these things in the same bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has really started on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China just isn't acting the way the American president would have wanted it to.
Russia is a chapter unto itself.
But if one were to summarize all this so that even the average voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what it is and what system of rules sanctions policy is based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump is only adding to what President Obama has already put in place, he has just given the go-ahead.
Then why the fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if Trump won the US election, he would hug Putin and lift the sanctions.
That's a terrible thought.
In practice, the opposite is true.
With Trump, sanctions are not being eased, they are being tightened.
But Europe is even more afraid.
German Foreign Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
You mean kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there's no kosher or EU anti-Russian sanctions.
European Commission President Juncker has complained that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
You mean to say that sanctions should be used only if they're weak enough to not threaten anyone?
The average voter is a little bit of a bum.
For three years he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now he finds out it's about EU energy security.
The voter is the winner.
Russia is being sanctioned for being too big to do things they shouldn't.
China is being vilified for not building enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country's borders.
All these punishments or just considerations have a rationality.
But does anyone see a system, an order, a rule?
I'm not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš got married, crossed the republic with his visionary book and finalized the electoral program.
Apart from the Pardubice region, he's already got all the candidates ready.
According to him, he didn't interfere with them in any significant way.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian school be run by the Heitman and the shadow minister of education of ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose between being a member of parliament or a gentleman", Babiš confirmed his earlier stance.
You've upset a lot of congressmen and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the towns and cities themselves, with managers.
You mean that?
That's not what happened.
I'm a big fan of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe we should elect mayors and mayors.
I don't talk about distracting the deputies in my book, but they could be there.
The question is how many.
At the launch of your book, What I Eat When I Sleep, I overheard you talking about abolishing the House of Representatives.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and reducing the number of deputies.
New York City, with nine million people, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 councillors.
And the mayor is blamed for not building enough and not doing big projects, but she doesn't have the competence.
The same is true of the government that in our history has been run by only two men, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
The current Prime Minister is not in charge, he's just moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to impose a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to enforce.
We're just changing the agenda to a one-way Senate election.
We also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House's rules of procedure to avoid unnecessary exhibitionism by Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and commissions, not show off at House meetings.
It's definitely not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator, you would run the government, control the House of 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors, control the entire country.
That's definitely not the case.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of MPs.
French President Macron announced a reduction of the legislative body by a third, whereas there are 57,000 French people for every legislator, while in our country there are 17,000 Czechs.
But no one is accusing Macron of endangering democracy.
Even if someone wins the election in the Czech Republic by a majority, we have mechanisms to prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the temptation is great for those who have a majority in parliament, just look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that in the case of the ANO movement.
We just need a team that works for the people in government, not for their parties or their resorts.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to raise only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services.
Why did they override me and add 21% to the GIBS members who are already making 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister should intervene when ministers are being sloppy, confusing the government with a travel agency and for state money they would like to do like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not argue in government, they should argue outside of it.
The cabinet has to go to the finished material, there is no place for coalition riots, force voting and bargaining, there is to decide.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team when ministers are mostly one-sided?
Above the parties is constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement was invalid and he sacked Babiše from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has the power to control, such a futile gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Have you decided who you'd recommend for Treasury Secretary?
I don't even think about it, because we're not going to be in that government, no one wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
Such skepticism is misplaced.
The mayor's got a businessman named Dudek who'd like to work with you, and with the people, maybe he'll win the wing of a George Snape who's sympathetic.
I don't think that's what it is.
The ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude a coalition with ANO, Václav Klaus Jr. may be able to get into the ODS, who will also not be opposed.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-Chairman of the ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Momentans are a possible coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says that's not what he said.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, he ran as a puppet of Vit Barty for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was some kind of coup.
He's obviously a very distinctive character.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed.
I'm not asking you to do that.
I wonder if you'd be comfortable with a man who has xenophobic views, speaks at a gallows demonstration and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr. Okamura's party. I can't imagine that.
It's clear he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the Communists' silent support for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's gonna be a winner-to-winner negotiation, but God knows who's gonna be the winner and who's gonna be the second.
Of course, it's important that they be able to negotiate the coalition government's agenda.
Let's go back to your attempts to run the state as a corporation.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything slip, never decided.
Coalition matters like CEEB or EGAP didn't work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, the CZ took control of the Czech government.
It's unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the CEZ management, which instructs the Minister of Finance how to vote at the CEZ general assembly.
If you were to become Prime Minister, would you change the personnel relations in the Supervisory Board and change the top management of ČEZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see about that.
I'm not him yet.
There's a rumor that the ZZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He'd like to trade a good relationship with the CPS for an even better one with the ANO.
Maybe after the election, things will move on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have a lobbyist for Humble or Rose, I'm a separate entity, and I'm not even dealing with this.
Then answer me directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institutions you criticize?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent company.
So far, he's been doing what he wants for years, thanks to the commissions for the traditional political parties.
You just have to look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in the CEZ, he never ran it, he was only there in numbers, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter to me.
The CEZ is to take the Dukovans, evaluate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The concept that the state should finance and build new nuclear power plants is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent advocacy campaign against me, but I don't and will not have any jurisdiction to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay for public broadcasting and television fees of about 7.2 billion dollars a year, but they don't really know how these institutions are run.
How can they not know?
After all, the Chamber approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the CTC and the CRO.
Look at the news reports on Sobotka Kalousek's superpower pact, which has always worked.
This is true both for the current parliamentary committee on leaks from investigative files and for lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push him to kick me out of the government, which added to the TOP 09 percent, but the CPSD took it.
They fear the disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about the threat to democracy by the Babi.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how ANO's first vice president Jaroslav Faltýnek is building his power base by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with the lawyer Květoslav Hlín, a close friend of the lawyer, with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railways?
We have a dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I've given him a few things to say.
Faltýnek argues that the lawyer in question works for substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't go that far.
As finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socan, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, Kratochvilov, Březin.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we'd fire the guy.
I'm uncompromising in that regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who.
