The Russian FASO will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency for Scientific Organizations (FASO) of Russia, in cooperation with the Russian Academy of Sciences, will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the last in a series of meetings held by the agency throughout the year, according to a press release received by Lenti.Ru.
The third meeting is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
The participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for conducting the evaluation of the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events to form a unified approach for all three academies to the methodology of evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
We've been able to do that for the past five months, and the final version of the regulations is being agreed upon.
According to the results of the next session, we should complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and terms of evaluation", said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert-analytical department of the Russian Federal Academy of Sciences and Sciences.
Representatives of more than 100 Russian scientific institutes will take part in the event.
A resolution is expected to be passed.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solyanka Street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to discover the relative stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to search among stars related, that is, arisen from one cluster.
The authors published their findings in the journal Nature, and a brief summary of the findings is available on the university's website.
The reason for the similar chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing of gas clouds prior to the formation of stars.
Even if a newborn star leaves the cluster, its chemical composition can be used to determine its birthplace and the region of formation of its parent stars.
Scientists had previously doubted that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could produce a chemical difference between it and its relatives in the cluster.
The results of modeling conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to model two streams of interstellar gas that together formed the cloud.
Over the course of several million years, this object is being transformed by its own gravity into a cluster in which protostars are beginning to form.
The scientists added paint-marks to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical uniformity.
Astrophysicists say their research proves that it is possible to search for chemical relatives to stars, and to identify possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carratia police arrested a 20-year-old man after a high-speed motorcycle chase.
The motorcycle was seized after it was driven at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h speed limit zone and through the bushlands to escape police in the Pilbara.
A traffic patrol in Carratha this morning attempted to stop a blue motorcycle, only to find it travelling at 125km/h as it left the service station on Bathgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued down Burgess Road, then turned into the bush, causing the officers to lose sight of him.
A motorcycle and a man matching the driver's description were seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgarr.
Carratta police have charged a 20-year-old man with failing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Carratta World Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and held for three months.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock on the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not "knock on the door" regarding the new sanctions.
This was stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
As for our response measures in case of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even argue, fantasize, because everything must be calculated concretely, "he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners are going to do this time, then we will make decisions about how to respond.
It will not be connected with the knocking of doors, some insults, misunderstandings, - the Minister stressed.
We will first of all be guided by our interests, the interests of protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business, and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners in terms of their adequacy, contractability and reliability.
The steps taken in the field of sanctions allow us to judge very well what the partners are achieving, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If you say out loud that "those sanctions will be painful for us too, but we are forced to go to it to punish Russia", it is probably not very adequate".
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to actively develop the WTO's toolkit, including when it comes to trade disputes, - said Lavrov.
We have already put this tool to work to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms to defend our position that the EU's third energy package should not be applied retrospectively", Lavrov said.
How can a mermaid be used in a garden design?
The questions are answered by Irina Okuneva:
Since the cherry tree loses its attractiveness after flowering, it is desirable to plant it along with other shrubs.
It blends in with many cultures.
And you can and should plant both ornamental plants and plants that bloom at the same time.
Another benefit of sirens is that they provide a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stump of varying heights, an improved bush, a broad-stemmed bush, and even a garden bonsai tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just pick the shape that best fits your garden design.
A resident of the Leningrad region was convicted in Karelia for selling fake money
According to the republican MIA, the man was engaged in his criminal profession in the Olonetsk and Segezh districts.
Besides Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olotsky District Court.
And to complete the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, was transferred to Segeju.
The investigation is proving guilty on several episodes of sale of counterfeit money, relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case materials with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court issued a decision to replace the four-year prison term with a general-regime colony.
The verdict has not entered into force.
Last week, two more dealers of counterfeit money were convicted, which they paid in the shops of Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from Saint Petersburg.
One of them is sentenced to five years, the other to four.
Each one is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict is not yet final either.
In Arkhangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish" was celebrated
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
The Dervish transported military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombale.
The event was attended by representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We first came together 23 years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who were not returned by the sea", - said the chairman of the Veterans Council of the Northern Sea Shipping Boris Karpov.
Then the city's brass band performed at the event, and cadet class pupils gave flowers to the veterans and marched with Russian flags and the Victory banner.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers on the cornerstone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of slippers, tin, wool and a lot of other equipment).
The ships also carried military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, and fifteen dismantled Harrikin fighters.
The convoy was escorted by 16 British ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships that took part in the vital operations of the caravans, 126 transport and about 50 warships were lost.

Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation that protects union organization as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs", says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is co-chair of the Progressive Caucus.
That's why I'm proud to present the Workers' Empowerment Act along with the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal standing against discrimination against union organizing as against other forms of discrimination, by stopping the forces of anti-union activists
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow workers who face discrimination for union membership to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to remember a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that unions have faced in recent years -- in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country -- Americans once supported countries around the world to embrace, expand and respect labor rights.
There was a time, as millions of Americans remember, when this country stood up for democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarised autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by a democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the workers' right to organize, to negotiate and to collectively act is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations for the purpose of protecting and improving working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to restrict this right shall have no legal force; measures designed to that end shall be declared unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests".
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic position that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to build civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize unions -- and for that union to participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies -- must be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now, everyone knows that the labor movement didn't undermine the nation's strength, but it did increase it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the expansion of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that historically enlarged America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a bill that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the passage of a Louisiana law that supporters say will likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Djinald in June and was set to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have hospital admissions within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's ruling means that for now, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to pursue their power of attorney", wrote Judge John deGravells in his decision.
The hearing will be held within a month of the judge making a more permanent ruling under this law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the ruling, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital privileges.
"Today's ruling ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a malicious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a lawsuit to block the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to the doctors from the two clinics, which were not plaintiffs in the case and also applied for admissions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that access laws place restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admissions authority, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticising the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission powers are pending.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to
At least half of the products in each type of goods in the assortment of trading networks should be of Russian production, according to the State Duma deputy from the "Fair Russia" faction Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian has drafted a bill to introduce protective measures against domestic producers, the newspaper "Izvestia" writes.
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible inconvenience to buyers.
For the rest of the products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers", - said Nilov.
Along with amendments to the article "On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, which establishes a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% interest rate quota in retail chains is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
The stalls will be several times the size of the domestic ones.
But the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to Sergey Litvinenko, a lawyer for the company "Nalogovik" and a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma", for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
The big winners are the farmers, the small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means more profits.
They will also have the power to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, who will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activity and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
It will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will be mastered faster, and it will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately", the expert notes.
Previously, Russian businesses often could not get into local stores because of the high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now that the embargo has been lifted, that niche is open to a sigh of relief.
But we should not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, it's a "quiet moment" when the old players have left and the new ones have not yet arrived.
After almost a month, we can speak of increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the price increase for finished products", - told AIF.ru the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", k.e.n. Tamara Kasyanova.
The idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will definitely allow the sector to be anchored to local producers.
In that case, they would be competing with each other, not with goods that are cheaper because of the subsidies of another country.
In other words, the competition for the buyer will be between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are not able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots in all items.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to "pull" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
This has led to fears that the stores will be sold with substandard products.
Foreign products with broken labels may be sold as Russian products", the expert adds.
The negative effect of the quotas will be felt by the large retail chains, especially those that benefit from the cooperation with importers.
Logically, this would also hurt foreign suppliers themselves, as demand for their products would decline.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported counterparts, while stores may raise prices to second-rate, as for scarce goods.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February this year due to the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, with the difficult relationship with the West, the issue of refusing imported products becomes even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to consider domestic manufacturers when forming orders to suppliers.
Then we will be able to move forward much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and the system of planning production for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time", says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25%.
Our farmers are really capable of completely covering the shelves of Russian stores.
Meat production could also be given a powerful boost.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% of the production is still Russian", Kasyanova said.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will help to replace imports and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution by itself, as this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is convinced.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not happen, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
It's not enough to set quotas, we have to establish domestic production in the country to meet these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees that will provide", the expert states.
Poor diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer kills more women in rural areas than in urban areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who are incubating in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35 percent survived five years after the diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher for those living in the state's rural and remote areas than for those living in urban areas.
RESEARCH: New drugs may slow the growth of lung and ovarian cancers
Researchers tracked the women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, current medical history, and socioeconomic status also affected her survival.
Older women and those who had cancer in the later stages at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regional or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
While the study was not designed to determine why women living outside of cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological surgeons, and they are mostly in big cities", she said.
While improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services, which would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people receiving treatment away from home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elishe Niv, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September , a new FAP will open its doors in Kujen district
The construction of the medical institution in the village of Toktaybelak was started in April this year and was carried out according to a model project.
The cost of the works amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Public Relations and Information Office of the Head of Mari El, the construction of the facility was financed from the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the newly built medical and preventive facility is almost 230 square meters.
The hospital will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: Toktaybelak village and villages of Dementiyevo, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraiblak, Shinur and Chashkayaal.
The new FAP will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet the sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will be opening soon.
The woman who killed her four-month-old son in her drunken state will be brought to trial .
A woman from Chuvashia will be on the bench for the murder of her own child.
Cheboksary has completed the investigation of the criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation established that on July 26 this year, the accused, along with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birth of her godmother's child in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the novodevil decided to stay in the guesthouse and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up in the night and cried, the woman, who was not sober, put him on the bed next to her to breast-feed him, but she soon fell asleep.
During sleep, a woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, according to the press service of the Chuvashia Regional Criminal Investigation Service, has been sent to court.
Inflation is off the holidays.
Will Russians feel the sharp rise in prices
As a result of the cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and not conform to the forecasts of the authorities, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
Experts believe that the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 the inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, and next year even less - 6.5%.
However, according to Kommersant, this week the Ministry of Economic Development is due to make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast for 2017.
According to the publication, the department may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in the income of the population.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation will be in force for one year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be predicted in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change", - said the source of the newspaper in the Ministry of Finance.
Economists at VTB Capital do not share the government's financial-economic bloc's expectations regarding inflation and forecast price growth at 8% in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come with the possible introduction of sales tax (SST) in Russian regions in 2015, experts believe.
Inflation will peak at 9% in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat released the first inflation results after Russia introduced "careful sanctions".
AIF.ru polled experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex FC:
Prices are already rising in the main product segments.
Moreover, as the prices of socially important products increased, the government was forced to introduce measures for systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason is initiating price increases.
The key factors driving the consumer price index continue to be the huge capital outflows, the excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, the internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, and the embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures had been kept under control, the cost of a minimum-priced grocery basket would not have jumped 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the import of foodstuffs caused a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final cost.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, the retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
Add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorated economic growth prospects, and inflation could well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of the analytical department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation was sometimes 20-30% per month, and in the zero years it was also above the current level, but that was offset by the rapid economic growth.
I think the inflation rate will be between 8 and 8.5 percent by the end of the year.
Platon Maguta, managing director of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor of the sanctions against Russia is being successfully contained, but if there is further pressure, especially on the financial sector, it could lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which usually traditionally manifests itself in the purchase of cash currency in order to protect their savings.
It is possible to assume that the government, the Russian Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But price increases have traditionally started after the summer's lull and may be more pronounced this fall.
The target consumer inflation rate of 7.5% in Russia is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial reserves.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decline in homeownership
Such a drop, driven by a dramatic decline in homeownership among those under 35, could see garden centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year as today's young consumers reach the "basic age of gardening", according to a study by the HTA reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend on average 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanised areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of the house for parking and the reduction in the size of gardens as other factors threatening an industry estimated to have annual sales of £5 billion.
Greater London, where home ownership has fallen from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, has the lowest rate of household gardeners spending in the UK.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have said that renting out housing and not having space for a garden doesn't mean people can't grow plants.
Geithner Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: "Cannons, for example, are especially popular with tenants who can take their plants with them when they move".
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as a "golden age" of retail gardening goods as a result of the increase in homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after unfavorable conditions in March and April last year.
The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture carried out a massive clean-up of the "Zemleđe" fund
Three of the four directors of the Earthworks Foundation were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four directors of the "Zemledzhie" foundation were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the suspension of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev from his post.
His place was taken by Lozana Vassileva.
It turns out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the foundation were quietly replaced on Friday.
The deputy executive director Tatyana Angelova, who was responsible for the state aid and the SAPARD program until then, was released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I wasn't on the board of trustees because we're not legally on the board, but I was told later that I was released.
I can't tell you why my resignation isn't posted on the foundation's website.
I'm on a holiday.
I hope to know more on Monday", Angelova told the publication.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of "Investment lending" in the central fund at "Zemledelije" in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until that point, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Foundation "Earth" in the city of Veliko-Tyrnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the Atija Aliyeva-Veli Foundation kept his post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons US diplomat over spy report
Turkey's Foreign Ministry has summoned the country's most senior American diplomat to comment on a report of American and British spying in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the US attorney general and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agency, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the significance of the report, saying that all major countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany's main intelligence agency also targeted Ankara sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's biggest companies have united against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social network, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete with Alibaba in the online trading market.
But catching up with the Chinese Internet miracle, which has even outstripped its American rivals, eBay and Amazon.com, will be a challenge.
The Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, with 70 percent of the money to be owned by Wanda and 15 percent each by the internet companies, according to a Wanda Group statement.
The company is planning to register in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu search with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to its network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial properties throughout China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year , the company invested 50 billion yuan (over $ 8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in the east of China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate revenues of $960 million.
Wanda is also owned by American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by its upcoming rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, the merger will enable Wanda to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, says Dong Ze.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers on the Internet so that they come to traditional offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon-selling services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce", said Wanda's chief executive Wang Jianlin, quoted by Bloomberg.
"There is no real O2O platform in China now, and in this situation, everyone has roughly equal chances", he said.
China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that it will more than triple to $395 billion by 2015 from 2011.
China's Internet users have grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg's official statistics, more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And by 2015, that number is projected to grow to 850 million.
The League of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was China's richest man until recently, but according to Bloomberg's billionaire index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's net worth is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is due to his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Lee is now the third richest man in China, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is fourth.
"It's very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer", said Cao Lei, director of the China E-Commerce Research Center in Hangzhou, to Bloomberg.
But he thinks the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba right after it was founded: "Rome wasn't built in a day".
It is not easy to compete with Alibaba, not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of global online commerce, as evidenced by the financial report published on the eve of Alibaba's last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company made more money than both of its American rivals combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period was almost double the similar aggregate of its competitors, almost tripling to $1.99 billion year-on-year.
"Alibaba still has huge money-generating potential, thanks in large part to its mobile apps", commented an analyst at Hong Kong-based Arete Research Service on the Bloomberg report.
According to an updated prospectus on Alibaba's website, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March figure (163 million).
And 32.8 percent of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is going to announce the value of its stock before the IPO.
According to the average valuation of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the stock sale.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could be as early as September 16.
The company's road show, which precedes the event, will kick off on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be the largest in NYSE history and bring in about $20 billion.
The previous record holder was Visa, which in 2008 made an initial public offering of $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the retail chains should be Russian-made, state Duma deputies say.
They've drafted a bill to do that.
It is about making changes to the article 8 of the Federal Law "On the Basics of the State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores must be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so they will be made "discounted" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
The bill also amends the Russian Tax Code to lower the VAT rate by 10 percent for all food products from Russia, the newspaper Izvestiya reported.
On August 27, a bill was introduced in the lower house of parliament to amend the Federal Law "On Retail Markets", which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers can sell their products.
Police Chief Magaluf is charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvià municipal officials to the Mallorca state prosecutor's office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the notorious centre of drunken revelry, Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been placed under guard as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipality officials to the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by the judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting their businesses.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival", one businessman told the court.
We cannot put our livelihoods at risk.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer giving a blowjob to 24 men during a bar-running.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop the drunken hooliganism among Magaluf holidaymakers by minimizing the number of notorious drunken bar-hopping escapades.
In addition, the Playhouse club where the minette incident occurred was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and Carnage bar-running organizers were jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The Maghalough tourist resort, popular mainly with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous drunken accidents linked to the frenzied fun known as "balconying", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into a hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked wet and windy conditions affecting flights at Adelaide Airport
A COLD spring surprise in the south of South Australia brought torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain fell on the city by 9pm, following 6.6mm that fell on Sunday night.
The latest rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and dumped nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a city-wide high of 15.8C.
The poor weather conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in boarding a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but it was caught in a wind shift - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h over land at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates from Dubai and Qantas from Sydney.
A high of 16C is forecast for Adelaide on Tuesday with a chance of one or two downpours.
The estimate of construction objects in the Russian Federation will be calculated in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service is taking special control of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks.
The FAS has created an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector.
At the meeting, the head of the FAS Housing, Construction and Natural Resources Control Vadim Solovyov said that "today's estimate of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, according to the FAS.
And they propose to determine the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage on the basis of market prices of design solutions instead of the currently applied estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals have been put on the road map and are now being considered by the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional construction estimates with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry", explained Vadim Solovyev to RGB.
Because every bolt and nut is counted in the estimate, it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
The Ministry agrees with the FAS.
"The first work on the transition to calculating the cost of the construction elements is already there: developed methods for calculating prices for the construction solutions, the compilation of estimates on these indicators, - told "RGB" the head of the Department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of construction, Yelena Zhukova.
The road construction sector was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As told "RGB" the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the estimated standards are long outdated, but another mechanism is not yet proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, it is difficult to implement in practice, as the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies", he says.
It's no secret that the construction industry is developing largely because of government orders.
According to the chairman of the board of the National Company "Expert Community of Professionals of the State Order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most capable customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director of engineering at Rosatom's capital construction branch center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competences and do not allow competitors to enter the field.
He believes that a transparent market can only be created when access to contracts is as free as possible from the influence of a controlling party.
At the expert council it was proposed to form the system of state orders in such a way that the same executor does not have the right to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to endow the customer with the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of staff of the customer and budgetary expenditures for its maintenance.
In this case, the customer's specialists will have to have knowledge to evaluate the quality of the work performed by the contractor organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, this breakdown will require determining who will be responsible for the security of the facility as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to lack of interest in obtaining a state order for an incomplete volume of work and a small amount of contract.
The deputy head of the expert-consulting center of the Institute of Purchases, Alexander Yevstachenkov, believes that now the procedure of state procurement has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "the participant when filling out the application should indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "must be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "of the same type", "not lower", "lower", "higher", "may", "may have", "may be", "earlier", "not earlier", "not higher", "not allowed" etc.
Thus, the contracting authorities often abuse their right to impose requirements on the content of the tender submitted by the contracting entities.
Another problem with the 44-FZ, according to Yevstachenkov, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of application.
Considering the participant's application, it is only possible to evaluate the contractor's qualification, but not the quality of the work, which has not even been started, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be judged when it is accepted.
The expert council also proposed to shift the marginal revenue from the top to the bottom echelon, to make the middleman contractors disappear.
Chairman of the expert council, state secretary, deputy head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this is not worth doing, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it's like the famous Arkadyr Raikin's "Ateliers" refrain: "Are there any complaints about the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in Gaza remained closed as the territory recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-stricken communities of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the Pasosh kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed the traces of shrapnel from the walls and the children's playground before the arrival of the students.
"We are a little afraid, but we are looking forward to the future", said Ronit Barth, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
A lot of kids in our neighborhood really need to get back to a life of measurement.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that going back to school was "a little strange".
"It was a difficult time, and we did not go out of our homes at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Until a ceasefire agreement ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad stayed indoors or left their homes, moving to safer areas farther from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian landmine shrapnel, are questioning whether they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reports that about a dozen families are still missing.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza that has aged badly from the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said, "We will do everything we can to give you knowledge and to ensure your safety".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement ended the fighting immediately, but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demands for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed over 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and UN estimates.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, has conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
Thousands of homes in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and the fighting continuing, officials in charge of education last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education like children around the world and Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in a school in Gaza.
According to a popular measure, property prices have shown the biggest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home price index for the Australian capital increased by 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This led to a combined increase of June, July and August of 4.2 percent, the largest increase in a winter month since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12-month increase to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless reported that Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney's house prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while Melbourne's prices have risen by 11.7 percent.
The next markets to gain were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which had gone through government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent a year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties listed for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high level of auction speed, the overall high sales speed and the current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that the value of housing will still rise over the next three months", he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and mining engineers Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on October Revolution Street 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house from the XVIII century has not changed since the construction, except for the deterioration.
Outsiders come here as an excursion, and the residents suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest house of Ufa, whose walls are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of the house's construction is not accurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out the building is almost 300 years old.
The old courtyard, the door always open, the creaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are close together, the walls are cracked, and in the openings from the shredded plaster, the street is visible in places.
It seems to be based on an honest word.
And the locals say, "You don't think so, but that's the way it is".
Living in a wooden house from the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The property is on the National Register, but the money for its upkeep hasn't been paid for decades, and we feel like museum pieces that the authorities have simply forgotten about.
It's been 40 years since the last renovation.
The walls are still pretty much intact, but the foundation is all rotted.
Many residents still use the outdoor toilet and bathe once a week in the public bath.
How can you be satisfied under these conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana is pulling back the curtain.
Now you see what you've only heard before: a stream of cars coming through the windows.
You see, the glass is shattered all the time, the windows are closed, and we're used to the noise.
But you get used to it, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
We have two rooms, we live together with our son.
Other families have much worse conditions, with ceilings on the second floor that are just over five feet high.
To contrast, Tatyana suggests to go to visit the neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Starostyna.
A friendly, hospitable woman on the doorstep offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14 square meters for four people, and this is how we live: my husband and I and our daughter and granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another living space. Ludmila looks around the room: the sofas, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them is her granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little differs from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But the ceiling is leaking regularly, the plumbing is no good.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment in a casual and surprising way, as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
So it boils down to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipe was last repaired about 40 years ago.
Then they made us a little kitchen in the corner and a toilet out of the old closet.
We live in the same apartment where Demidov and his family lived, with servants on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The real estate agency says privatization is irrelevant.
We'll only get the one-bedroom apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to move us, but nothing happened.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment (room)! My grandparents, my mother and father, my husband and I, my daughter and granddaughter.
Things have happened in that time.
Like, there were these big rats running around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they're three feet thick!
They say the solution was mixed with eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demidov!
I guess that's why no one's been killed by a collapsed ceiling or a pile of wood.
But the building is slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house are rotting, the floors have repeatedly failed, we have poured cement, but all to no avail - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say it is, that there is a secret passageway under our room and a passage to the White River, which was specially made by the Old Believers who once lived here, so that they could hide from danger, in case.
They were being pursued.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start excavating in the apartment.
And then convinced them to give them a living space in exchange for his one on October Avenue.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are we going, the four of us?
And there's a small hope that they'll make the house more spacious.
If we agreed to trade, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Old Ones didn't win anything, though.
Ludmila's biggest dream is to have them moved in, and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter given a separate room.
So two families have been allocated a two-bedroom apartment instead of the not-so-magnificent ruins that two generations now live in.
A cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms of 75 square feet [23 sq m], called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You see the conditions.
The stucco falls off in pieces, like the window frames, and the walls in the kitchen and the rooms have gaping holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
If you walk through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can see that the Lavrentyev couple from apartment No. 4 were the luckiest of all.
They occupy the largest rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
75 square feet, three people registered.
We live in the same rooms where legend has it that Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high, the space is great.
The only thing that's bad is that everything is falling apart, falling apart, falling apart.
The neighbours must have told you!
The worst part was the floors, the wooden planks rotting, the ground literally falling from under us.
I've got the supports, the clamp, the hall is empty, and in the other room we're walking, swinging on the swings, so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you more about the house of the merchant Yevdokim Demidov than any guide.
He treats the goldsmith like his own son, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagina and Uzyan factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of the commercial real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they don't want to live under the same roof with history anymore.
I settled here as a child, in the 1940s, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
At that time, wooden carriage rooms, stables and guard booths were built around the building, which were later demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to clear our house, but something prevented...
In 2014, the same thing happened: they were given new housing.
We were collecting all the paperwork, and we were running around, and we found out that the move was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in any of this anymore.
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
The tenant's been denied.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as a joke, they were given a piece of paper without a signature and a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of the tenants".
I have a feeling that our house is no longer in the city plan, because it was first at number 57, then 57A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was torn down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" has appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the land resources management of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house at 57/1 October Revolution Street is included in the program of resettlement of dilapidated housing.
I can't be responsible for the actions of the officials in the 70s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical importance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, - is successfully implemented.
The residents will be moved to new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be done by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
There's an architecture biennale in Italy right now, and the Old Ufa project is one of the other ones.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Stara Kazanska street will be restored, - says the official.
The house will have a proper look, like it was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house will most likely become a museum open to all.
In addition, the government has decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, we can't do it in the morning, because the traffic is too heavy in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are not likely to be satisfied: Their new apartments will have the same floor area as their current ones.
Just from another era.
In Primorye , a forest fire started because of a thunderstorm .
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Ochtnichsky forestry in the Pojarsky district of the Primorsky region.
We're building up the force and resources at the scene.
According to the leadership of the KGSBU "Primorskaya avibaba", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the air base:
The fire, which occurred in a difficult-to-reach area, was detected by an observer pilot from the side of the patrol airship An-2 on an area of 3 hectares.
The wood is burning on the old fireplace.
The heavy swamped terrain and steep slopes of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing sites for fire-landing creates considerable difficulties in extinguishing.
We need an Mi-8.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the airbase by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, 4 firefighters were dispatched to the fire extinguishing area.
The main task of the specialists is to put out the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the lunch area in the area of the village of Ohunnichy, 3 additional fire-desantniks were delivered by helicopter.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the fire extinguishing site, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lennie Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of shows on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move it out!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown-ups when I was a child, would go with him to the pub and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket stroke.
I've never spoken to him like that.
He was the kind of grumpy guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than they had been in his father's day, he was able to glimpse what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoky, deep in the labyrinths of hell with the flashes of fire and smoke and the piles of soot.
My dad would get in the bath and just lie there, and you'd hear him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to get away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn our living, and I began to appreciate him more.
Yet, Henry grew up without parental affection.
My father never hugged me, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother was getting sick at the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billie, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he had lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I have 22!
With Don French.
Why can't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They're still good friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why wouldn't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother was diabetic.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was really, really well and I was showing symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to do something radical.
I also began to do some serious fitness training, and I also had to go on a strict diet to alleviate the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it is boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's change of career trajectory is perhaps reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has immersed himself fully in the theater.
Then came The Comedy of Errors, and then The Troubles by August Wilson.
This work is different from the sitcoms and comedies that were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him impersonating on stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies: "For quite some time, I was the only black comedian/parody on television".
He was learning on the job.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, but I had to learn to be an effective joke machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to The Black and White Show of Minstrels, a light entertainment program in which people "bleached their faces", Henry found himself performing in it for five years.
My family was very unhappy about that.
I guess I wish it had never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I was working in large venues and learning to work with crowds.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
By portraying characters who both mocked and celebrated black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the nineties he was known as, among other things, the chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series "LennyHenry.tv", he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little like you're stretching time or slowly turning it aside".
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good about...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I can't say I was taught much about it in school, and I thought it was pretty much the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and a cabbage on the bottom.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, they said, "You have to try it.
Don't curse it until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words aloud and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and he got hooked.
I got a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head has been straightened.
"This is what it is, this is serious business, take it seriously, learn your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was really tough, and I read this play for months and months before we even did it.
And it was a success.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, but it didn't happen.
Soon we started the Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I'm in the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
A technical glitch occurred, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to work for 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle it.
"You're in the play, stay in the role".
Henry in The Abduction at the Dachshund Theatre
It was hard to learn the lyrics for "The Troubles".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above saying, 'This is what you should do.'"
He says it, of course, in a THUNDERY voice.
So I'm holding on to this.
I really like it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has his comedic mind, and all the way through our conversation, we're interrupted by his bursts of humor, where he starts and stops parodying.
I just decided not to do standup, because this whole thing of getting instant rewards from a room full of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying, it can lead to a dead end.
I do some live-action work at Apollo when I want, but mostly, I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey -- I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's a lot of fun.
You're always telling a story, and this is the perfect place to do it.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has started biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove "blind workers" from the government payroll.
Employees who fail to register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to reduce corruption in government structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was missing from payments to "invisible workers" and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the civil service, reports BBC reporter Wanyama Chebussiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All government employees are to report to the identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through the biometric registration procedure, the government statement said.
Anyone who fails to do so without good reason will be removed from the payroll, it says.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government - thus ending the problem of 'invisible workers,'" said Anne Weiguru, Cabinet Secretary for Planning and Structuring.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local news agencies reported.
Police officials did not immediately comment on the information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to the Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in a corruption probe last December that targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and wiretapping their phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (who was Prime Minister at the time) identified their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
Not every school held a September 1 ceremony.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, the huge united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleks Pastuhov, the head of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle down here and that the children will learn things that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children donning embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rhona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the kind of imposing executive it needs.
It's followed by a trail of fame from the banking world, media management and Tory inner circles.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a male colleague, who held a lower position, took the top job at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Her political standing is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councilman.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned bowl.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two directions: inward as the top level of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but outward as the voice of public anxiety and excitement when things go wrong.
It's an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in and dismantling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself would lose his job in the process.
It's a tough call.
If it were not so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC reduced in size, after a review of its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of the licence pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British are buying a stake in what is arguably the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that its results reach 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, it is clear that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today, up from 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get the headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed shows on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs a big chairman - I hope he found one.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by an outsider.
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday night contained a derogatory image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
There was just a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it", a later post said.
Perry's aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually posting to the tape.
An earlier tweet contained a lewd caricature of Travis County Prosecutor Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of DUI in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her department when she refused to resign, which led to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk, 3 times the legal blood alcohol level, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for telling me about it".
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Bureau did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was headed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who had been appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge presiding over the case to drop the indictment, saying the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is vague and unconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funding to the state's Department of Public Oversight, which is based in Travis County and is dedicated to prosecuting public-sector corruption in Texas, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted a formal complaint from a left-leaning public-control group.
Perry's verified account tape is updated frequently - and sometimes becomes famous.
As fifth-place finisher at the Iowa caucus during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by a lake and the words, "Here we go, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the housing market is back to "normal".
One of London's most prominent property developers warned that the real estate market in southeast England had "returned" to its normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were in high demand and prices were rising rapidly, with widespread fears that a credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday that "the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the beginning of the current fiscal year from the peak of 2013", adding that this has provided a "stable working environment".
London's housing market has thrived during the downturn as foreign buyers flock to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in the last year alone, according to the Land Registry, far outpacing the 6.7 percent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes rose by about one fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London's property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage market reform, which introduced stricter lending conditions, would also lead to a decline in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its London property price growth forecast for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis that property price sentiment has already begun to soften.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell by a quarter from a year earlier in London's most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for houses in the capital proved very favourable to Berkeley, raising sales to over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgely added: "The demand for the right product with the right design and the right location has remained the same and, reflecting that, sales have held up for the time being".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual profit before tax rose 40 percent from the previous year to £380 million, earnings up 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking at the company's annual meeting Monday, Mr. Pidgeley said that Berkeley's projected earnings for this year will be in line with current market expectations.
The consensus of analysts is that we're looking at a pre-tax profit of £450m for the full year.
Berkeley's shares were trading at £23.96 this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked were posted online by a hacker.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
Pictures of the nude Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of 100 other rising stars.
A representative for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "blatant invasion of privacy".
There's a law enforcement complaint, and they're going to prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan were allegedly obtained through a flaw in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "directory" of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are genuine, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. All" star Winstead also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"For those of you looking at the pictures I took with my husband years ago, alone at home, I hope you are proud of yourselves", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickelodeon's "iCarly" and "Victoria the Victorious" denied that the photos were of her, tweeting: "These so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, folks.
Let me stop this in its tracks.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a representative for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos allegedly of her were genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the critically acclaimed letter "J".
They dissolved, or so to speak, they gradually fell apart, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did a woman tell him he was too serious, too difficult to communicate with, tense, closed off and perhaps a little annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was as prickly as a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this sting was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, a release from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a flimsy, fragile beauty with tangled hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Royen.
She came south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a barren but paradise-like valley with the cheerful name "Paradise Valley".
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were running, the spiders were sitting motionless in the bath, the slugs left their tracks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds, like giant cabbage.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author's Note: Howard Jacobson, whose novel J was longlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The short list will be announced next week .
Kevern and Eileen sat hand in hand on broken chaise-longues among the tall grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both distractedly connected to the cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he recalled the old song of a long-forgotten black performer that his father loved to listen to when the curtains in the house were down.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their aggressive nature, these types of songs were never played on the console again.
They weren't banned -- nothing was banned -- they just weren't played anymore.
They've been helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Social taste did what orders and precepts could never do, and just as people chose from books the memoirs of rich men raised in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose from all music the ballads.
Having had a good afternoon, Cavern began playing an imaginary piano and in a rough comic voice he praised Eileen's big feet.
Eileen didn't know.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he told her, mechanically putting two fingers to his lips.
It's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" from flying off his lips.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with a "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of him.
Jazz wasn't played either, although it wasn't outright banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only room for one "if" in life.
When the tune started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
And the same with the wit.
His unpredictability got people on edge.
And jazz was wit, expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10 without ever hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she could hardly remember a time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude -- the gratitude of those who were spared by fate -- with the principle of group predisposition.
Afro-Caribbean people were well-suited to entertainment and sports by temperament and physical characteristics - and they sang and ran.
The people of Indostan, who seem to be naturally talented in all things electronics, have taken it upon themselves to ensure that no family is left without a working electronic telephone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was occupied with sanitation work; what remained of the Greek diaspora was engaged in the milling of plates.
The Gulf and Levant outsiders whose grandfathers didn't leave the country in a hurry when THAT WAS HAPPENED, IF THAT WAS HAPPENED, for fear of being accused of starting the fire, fear, actually, of being consumed by the flames next, opened restaurants with lava and chalk, stood by and languished in idleness.
To each according to his ability.
As she had only heard ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just spoken to her could be set to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", said Cavern.
Except maybe for people with big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No words could pass through the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't understand it after all.
How could your father like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to put his fingers on his lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, closing the Keverny review.
There was nothing in the whole world but the spear of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he'd want to look at.
"Well, if you say so", she said, sticking to her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"I like you precisely because you have thick ankles", he tried to say instead.
I have this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him into awkward situations because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that would soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Cavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eileen Solomons turned red and stood up from the lounge, knocked over the console and poured out the wine they were drinking.
The wine was from a bottle, so drunkenness was no excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you're stupid", she said...
I don't like you.
He felt sorry for her, both for the excessive rudeness of his words and for the fear that appeared in her eyes when she replied to him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She hadn't told him about the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that in some fundamental ways she was like this.
The same vast sea of ice fell on them both.
The same bewildered men, even more sensitive and capricious now that they've gone, if they're ever going to go, than their smugglers and wreckers, have been wandering furiously from pub to pub, ready to lay their hands on any woman who dared to refuse them or to tease them.
A dull head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First they would kiss - kissing was now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave - first kiss her, then hit her.
A redundant statement, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already a hooligan.
Eileen solomon's body language is telling him he needs to go.
He got up from the couch like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the upstairs window she watched him go, her companion, a man who had taken the burden on himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a little compassion for him and for men in general, even though some of them raised their hands against her.
The man who had turned away from her, with his back to her, embarrassed, beaten, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember any occasion, until today, when she had seen such a thing?
Again, the Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or thereabouts, Esme Nussbaum, a bright and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked for Ofnaut, the informal service for monitoring public sentiment, prepared a small report on the persistence of low and moderate levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not to cease altogether, given the resources and efforts that were being devoted to eradicating it.
"Much has been done, and much is being done", she wrote, "to soften the inherent aggressiveness of people who have fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and narrow swatches of country, where, despite churches hovering over the hedges, the gentle breath of human goodness has rarely been felt throughout history.
But some qualities, it turns out, are not eradicated.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it engenders.
People cry over sentimental ballads, swallow stories of obstacles overcome, and proclaim their fervent belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only is the old rudeness holding its own in rural communities as well as urban settlements, but there is evidence of a new and vicious backwoodsman in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
"You have a bad habit of writing too much", said her scientific supervisor after reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I do not think I am obliged to answer", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
The silence again.
"I ask", Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I am against atheism, or lesbianism, or feminism.
We don't have any prejudice here.
We are servants of the community without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, which are perfectly acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes skew the results, like the ones you showed me.
It is clear that you yourself are prejudiced against the Church, and what you call "mean" and "gross" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to dwell on what happened, if it happened at all, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink, flamingo-like, LED letters echoed the advice that the Ophenau has given the country for the last quarter-century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better than silence, a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean", Esme Nussbaum replied quietly, as she made sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I mean nothing except that we have not been cured as effectively as we have been convinced.
What worries me is that if we're not prepared, we'll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened, if at all.
Only this time, we're not gonna take our anger and distrust out on anyone.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips into a pyramid.
This gesture was supposed to be infinite patience.
"You go too far", he said, "by calling "mistakes" what our grandparents did or did not do.
You go too far when you talk about how they've dumped their "anger" and "distrust" on "the others".
A man in your position shouldn't need to be reminded that in understanding the past, in defending the present, we're not talking about "us" and "them".
There was no "us" and there was no "others".
It was a time of unrest, that's all we know.
"Which, to be honest with myself", Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can justify well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what's done is done.
That was then.
There's nothing more to say, we're in agreement.
And how not to blame anyone, not to justify yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be fixed.
But what's the point of the past if not to learn--
The past exists so we can forget it.
If I may add one word to that -
The pyramid of Luther Rabinowitz has collapsed.
"I will consider your report", he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was struck by a motorcycle rider who had driven onto the sidewalk, as passersby described it, "in a rage of rage".
Coincidences are made.
Lesotho army says coup was not planned; PM stays in South Africa
The army denied the coup was being planned to overthrow the government, saying they were acting against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane fled the country, saying that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Prime Minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming that he had received death threats.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no coup, but that the army was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" that the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Armed Forces of Lesotho took action after receiving some intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force who are really planning to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos", he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monjeela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, the actions of the Lesotho armed forces at this time appear to have the hallmarks of a coup", he said.
Lesotho's army officials said that soldiers returned to barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motejowa Metzing is running the government in Tabane's absence.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked for trying to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements within his united government.
He claimed that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on loan at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
He only played three times for the London club last season.
It should be noted that Milan had previously loaned Liverpool forward Fernando Torres.
Production in the eurozone at its lowest level in 13 months
Eurozone manufacturing growth slowed to a 13-month low in August, according to a popular study.
The latest Markit eurozone manufacturing PMI fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
Anything over 50 is growth.
New orders have been delayed, and businesses have suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values were submitted to the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone's stagnating recovery, as well as the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may be giving additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent", said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany's manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a real concern, as does Italy's slide from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that the growth momentum has waned in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to confidence", Mr Dobson said.
The industry's slowdown is likely to add fuel to the fire of analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the Eurozone manufacturing sector's business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing".
He added: "Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business - and especially consumer confidence - and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it "looks more and more like" that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited".
The people of Mariupol will put up a live chain against the militia
Mariupol was quiet until last week - no one was rushing to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Azov Sea lived and worked.
Now the townspeople await the arrival of the "militants" with horror.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which until then was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but its forces had little against the well-armed representatives of the DNR-LNR, and were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the Ukrainian anthem.
They're going to do the same thing in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and food, collect medicine, publish a newspaper.
The city is slowly closing shops, banks and ATMs.
Ten years of hell for survivors Beslan: Ten years since the horrific takeover of the school, as the children who were there are still suffering
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
Over 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day ordeal that shook the world.
We've returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school massacre.
Exactly ten years after the horrific Beslan school siege that killed 334 people, including 186 children, heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, took and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed like the ultimate evil.
Tragedy united East and West in disgust, which then miraculously turned into action and hope for the future in the face of the greatest sorrow.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who stood up to the tragedy, even though the memory of the terrorist hell would live with them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the photo is trying to get back into the shooting gym.
She is captured in a photo by the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, as she tries to climb back into the shelled gym after a mine explodes.
In her confusion, Aida desperately searched for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't", Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to safety.
After a series of operations, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
A few fragments in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it", she says defiantly.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zeera Gapoyeva, was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little, and we used to dream of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I'm done with school and I'm working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the seizure stays with her, though the memories fade a little bit every year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our hardships, and we're so grateful for the help we've received from people in the UK and elsewhere.
When I see a picture of me climbing into a school window online, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead.
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven years old, and he said, "My mom told me to lie down if it exploded and hold her hand".
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the baby's hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: "Demir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried tears of joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper), where he was awarded the Children's Defender Award by Barnardo's Foundation, by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it", he said yesterday.
I can tell you that he's fading in my memory.
I remember, right after that, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer shoot 'em up games, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and the ride in the open-wheel car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors", said Damir, who volunteered at a women's monastery last week.
I want to help.
I want to be a police officer someday and I hope to be accepted into the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence immediately after the capture, there just weren't any children running around screaming and yelling, and that silence went on for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip with Damir to London.
People in London cried when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world can understand how we feel, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Sheri and just tell her myself that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think the world hasn't gotten any better in the last 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine right now, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like us.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're doing something else.
I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very gentle and calm boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, for example, he's not obsessing over this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but he's very close to six of his classmates, and they go to the gym every now and then and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning his back on us, for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can't believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the blast and stand up, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me, with body parts lying everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that there was no way my little boy could survive this hell.
"I remember I shouted to him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after the capture became the defining moment of the Beslan tragedy
On the left: Beslan survivor Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 capture, and on the right, Georgi today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he narrowly escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a senior doctor, drove him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, leaving my little boy alone for three nightmarish days", she recalled.
Not alone, but there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer it gets, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day that goes by that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it was long ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes from those days are always before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Heartbreaking: The photo of Georgi (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and has been immortalized in a sculpture (right)
I remember that George wanted to go to school that day, that he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a statue of a weeping George in San Marino.
Georgie doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that because of this photo, people all over the world feel our pain.
George now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we will ever know the truth.
People keep investigating these tragedies and never get the truth.
Now they're investigating this Boeing crash in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this is happening, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing for this kind of pain.
We need decades to forget her for a while.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares about being seized, but now I'm better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I keep going to that gym every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated this year and entered medical school in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it's not gonna happen.
Georgy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Unbelievable: Georgi Farniev was at the feet of the terrorist-murderer during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the seizure, he was photographed in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murderer-terrorist.
Indeed, it's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems like yesterday", says Georgi, who wanted to study to become an intelligence officer in the FSB but was unable to do so because of the damage to his health caused by the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are good at dealing with bad things, and I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I wish I could forget.
In 2005, the following year, was the first and last time I ever walked into that gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in that famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with an open laptop photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is immense, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I'm healthy.
I have to be careful with my knee, which was damaged, but now I walk normally.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something kids should know about, and it's certainly not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to commemorate her.
I know that Georgy won't go.
It must be stronger for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he came back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgi is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I'd say he's 50% over the nightmare, but you can't just completely overcome it and move on.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the occupation, and this only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families where new babies were born, but I know widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I'll never forget how my heart leapt out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's happening in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is very close to our country now, and I find it hard to believe.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure, many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more will be killed.
If we could just grab all the rebels and throw them as far away as we can.
I'm not sure.
The baby who was moved to safety by the special forces
Rescued: Alena Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now ten years old (right), she has no memory of the monstrous crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman carried little Alyona out of a captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, her 10-year-old sister Christina, and her brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, then three years old, survived, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in a massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and he and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, remembers nothing about the seizure and has blossomed into a bright and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They are a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both wonderful children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great dad and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the tenth anniversary comes around.
I can see why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who returned to Borussia Dortmund from Manchester United, said he was looking forward to playing for the German club again.
He said this transfer was a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again, "Kagava said.
I feel really good.
I'm full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to the day I can take the field in a Borussia shirt again.
Kagawa joined Manchester United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for €16 million.
However, he was never able to establish himself with the English club, having spent two seasons in the English Championship, scoring 6 goals and 8 assists.
A man accused of hitting a girl at the Pelican crossing in Fife .
A 78-year-old man is to stand trial on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at a crossing in Pittenweem in East Neuk.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 with a lack of care and attention and hit the girl, causing her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, has denied any wrongdoing in Dundee County Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the King's Counsel, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande are not going to be in Vladivostok.
The Duty Free store at Vladivostok airport has put up a sign forbidding a number of world political leaders from shopping there.
Don't load it with perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store's management has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other prominent comrades will not be able to purchase vodka, cognac and perfume in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama was previously barred from the even less accessible MSU Dietary Dining Room, according to the public-food website.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating at a Russian diet restaurant is unknown, but the authors of the ban seem to themselves to be terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to agrarians
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the conditions of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies to establish the production of customer-demanded varieties of cheese.
The advice was given during a visit to the "Yugptseprom" enterprise of the "Agrocomplex" firm.
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to switch to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the appropriate level.
An annual food import embargo was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team, Valentin Maslakov, is satisfied with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, third place is a good result, given the lack of purposeful preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All sport" words Maslakov.
Third place is a confirmation of our fairly high command.
It's nice to know that the advantage the French and even the Americans have over us is minimal.
We have to consider that we are not prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we're not committing our leaders to the DecaNation match.
We've been runners-up in the tournament in recent years, but this season we've got a new squad.
The French, on the other hand, put together a formidable squad of 13 European champions.
They have made no secret of their intention to win this year, as they have publicly announced many times.
But even this lineup of hosts couldn't stand up to the Americans.
So I think the Russians have performed at a good level in such a representative company.
But some of the other games were an order of magnitude below the Diamond League.
The season's over.
Of course, the outcome is not as important to athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The place was the key.
And the results, I agree, have been absurd, since the 1500 men were so obsessed with the tactical tricks of running that they were below the average... of women's running.
4 tips to get better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, there are a number of options for equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof "soap" like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday using several cameras, all for about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow in order to get the best results.
Check your equipment again.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery cell and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you will be taking.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for dim underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, you have to figure out how deep your equipment can go.
Some of these cells are only five feet long, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots, because a lot of them don't work.
The soapbox has a VC that helps you organize the shots, whereas action cameras don't usually have one.
Even if you have a VCD, it's hard to see underwater, and the framing is random.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial mode, which takes multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The amount of light decreases dramatically the deeper you go underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to transfer more color to the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the subjects.
That's great advice for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.
This is especially important if you're shooting on an action camera: this equipment often comes with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you'll have to get close to your subjects if you want to complete the shot.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling, Bilal Makhov, may switch to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by head coach of the Dagestan national team for freestyle wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete in the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Makhov is on the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajidov.
In fact, in junior, Biyal played both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he won the freestyle wrestling tournament and was third in the Greco-Roman wrestling competition, and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
There's been talk for a long time that our heavyweight will be entering the Greco-Roman wrestling phase of his career.
I'll tell you more: Makhov can play at the world championships in Tashkent - if he wins the match.
But the key word is always with the coaching staff headed by Gogoi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose strength of character could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist, he has devoted his career to relieving patients of the pain of illness as well as the pain of treatment.
Among those who came to him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors were obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment were primarily concerned with something else - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I was not feeling as I normally would", he wrote last May.
I had a hard time finding my strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself angrily berating his wife, Juliet.
"I want things to happen sooner rather than later", he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
He had a colleague do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-rays came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers develop lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients are smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause is asbestos, a fibrous building material once called "a miracle" but now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a thing of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it's hardly a cause for concern today.
But that's the wrong kind of calm.
Britain, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die of mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an estimated 2,500 deaths per year, more than twice as many people die from this disease as from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're feeling its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually outlawed in 1999), it usually takes tens of years for mesothelioma to develop.
And mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the stores where we shop.
As a result, mesothelioma does not care about class, wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of the elite, from the fashionable London department stores to the private schools, have not been the salvation.
The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have become reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipefitter.
In fact, he had to think of where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he got it.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels of the hospital in Gaya, where I spent six years as an intern", he wrote.
Students, nurses, doctors, and truckers all used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers have the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could only partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who have interned at Guy's Hospital and subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one who survived".
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live this long.
Fifty percent of people with mesothelioma die within eight months of diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will get this disease?"
According to the UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely that between 1970 and 2050, when the UK's asbestos epidemic should be winding down, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't realize they're going to die like this.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada by Alamy
A quick glance at the courtroom reports, where victims often go for compensation, reveals just how far the mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to inadvertently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked at the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in their 20's.
"Before this happened", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, and I had barely heard of asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Actually, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word "asbestos", which means fibrous structure, which gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is the most common building material today.
It's been used in roof panels, floor tiles, insulation pipes, boiler seams, even in car brake pads.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, yet it is recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amocite) and blue asbestos (croquidolite).
The UK was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong, though indirect, evidence that this is the main cause of the exceptionally high rate of mesothelioma [in the UK]".

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients suggesting that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Much of this impact, he says, is due to "routine use and exposure to weather" in our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even at the very heart of government, could be unconsciously exposed.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical shafts and pipelines behind the premises of parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibres of which could be set in motion by something as harmless as "strong air currents".
Members of Parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Housing Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been given a "clean sanitary certificate", it now acknowledged that £1 billion of work was needed to reconstruct the Houses of Parliament by upgrading the electrical system and removing the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of Parliament might sit in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to various rules".
There's no way to know if this management error will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One who has never been able to identify his exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that had successfully sued for asbestos", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places and dates that he worked.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December of 2009 when he was struck by what looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation late last night.
Suddenly I started to have a fever.
It started really fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The doctors were so concerned that they took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually, his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms would return, often after he exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his office with similar symptoms, and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott did not link it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and had worked with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious in this case.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and his consulting physician showed his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
I didn't really care about that, to be honest.
But my wife, Rachel, was worried.
The biopsy came back in the week between Christmas and New Year's, and it said, "They told me it's mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: I was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
All of a sudden Abbott was in a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"Asbestos was found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings, where it was quite common to have asbestos insulation on pipes", he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting this disease.
So, mesothelioma now affects younger people in non-traditional occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it was unlikely that patients would be harmed.
But many employees who took the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson did), or ate in the basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were places that were supposed to save the lives of patients, but they were places that were life-threatening for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
The students set their Bunzen burners on asbestos stands
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls because of its remarkable insulation and fire resistance.
Schools too.
In fact, many of them were likely first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren set their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
Web sites have emerged to draw attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless items as floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's been put into a lot of our buildings", says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could recall was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when you bring down the garden sheds.
The impact of a diagnosis, when you know that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
"It takes a long time to realize that", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to go and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was to go from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being overwhelmed by the amount of information he had to take in.
"It was hard to understand", he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?'
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's all there is to it.'"
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it's the very mechanics of how we sustain life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes the cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When the asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get trapped in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is caused by inhaling asbestos fibres", says Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The same hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, the leading center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who may have been exposed while interning at the hospital.
When the asbestos needles hit the lung tissue, Treasure says, "breathing pushes them out to the periphery, where the membrane is.
It's essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
Conventional treatments for other cancers are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree with me.
"You can't cut the pleura", he says.
There's no way to get around it with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not respond well to chemotherapy", which "works" but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are patients who live a long life", says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
The writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a one-man support and counseling agency for his patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central", he said cheerfully when they called.
"It was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott was initially offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would have taken four months and would have extended his life by only a month.
"I was in despair", he says.
I wanted to give myself up.
Lawson, however, "has managed to put a little more positive spin on things".
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdounsky, Professor of Thoracic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I didn't need directions, I just called them, and they took me in", Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get a referral and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to get the best available treatment.
But when such treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to court for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could pose health risks.
That's when they started talking about corporate malpractice.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full value settlement", according to Morgan, as Lawson was unable to conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating his death, a Guy's hospital spokesman nevertheless confirmed that "the asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying a fatal asbestos exposure to one company or workplace - usually decades afterward - has proven to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves from lawsuits know that time is on their side, which the plaintiffs don't.
In response, this year saw significant new legislation that makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under the Act, a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was set up for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could prove contact but who had no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court would award in a normal compensation case - about £120000.
About 300 successful lawsuits are expected under this scheme each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that £350 million represents a "very good deal" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers", he says, implying that the amount is a quarter of what the insurers would have had to pay had it not been for the time-out and the ability of mesothelioma patients to track down the companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, quick action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much, and they need help today", Penning said during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdowski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Trzegar, he found effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a three-way treatment, in which Lange-Lazdounsky boasts a whopping 40 percent survival rate in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"That's certainly one of the most important things", says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some force that's holding you back.
When you give up, things can go bad really fast.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
The follow-up scans showed no signs of disease.
Then I had a scan in March [2014].
There were several spots [of cancer] in my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not a life-threatening condition.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six rounds of chemo.
Now there's no sign of the tumor.
However, the process is physically and emotionally draining.
You can think about practical things like finances when I die, or showing your wife how to work a timer on a water heater.
When you get bad news, you get depressed.
We have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls in a very short time.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
These are conversations that all cancer patients have to face.
But for people with mesothelioma, that discussion is not balanced by hope, even a glimmer of survival.
This illness carries with it (even as it did, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos tissue.
Asbestos fibres are used to strengthen the pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now we have a canvas that won't catch fire.
I've seen napkins made of it smolder in the fireplace at banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and cloth.
Large asbestos mines are opening in Canada and South Africa and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It's the perfect insulator for the steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
World asbestos production is growing by more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential's statistics reveal a premature mortality rate among those who work with asbestos and are denied life insurance as a result.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that asbestos particles in her lungs "were, beyond all doubt, the principal cause of death".
This is the first case of its kind.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, have not admitted their responsibility.
There is no compensation.
During World War II, shipbuilding, one of the most deadly occupations in terms of asbestos contact, was intensively developed.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful asbestos injury claim in the UK.
Worldwide asbestos production is growing at more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139000 tons.
The Health and Safety Executive in the UK requires all asbestos contractors to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is banned in the UK.
Mesothelioma Act is passed in the UK.
A £350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is about 2 million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to elect its leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to kick off the long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision by the All-China People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It has not disappointed our expectations, but it has angered us", said lawmaker Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it's obvious that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, said that allowing the popular nomination for the election of the Hong Kong leader would be too "random".
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to vote for the head of government starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the nomination commission, which is tightly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer of some of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
The Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement is behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, with its organizers threatening to shut down Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the weeks to come.
However, they did not disclose the details, apparently seeking to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "has considered the possibility of taking over the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can be taken only if all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that for now, all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the capture of the central district is certain to take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security at the government headquarters was tightened with police and barricades.
The underlying cause of the unrest is the feeling many in Hong Kong have that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of mainlanders is increasing competition for goods and services.
There are also growing fears that Hong Kong's values of democracy and free speech are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized Occupy Central, saying its demonstrations put at risk business, the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protest they are talking about could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long", said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is spiraling out of control.
It's a performance that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media also ran reports in recent days portraying Hong Kong's democracy activists as Western-directed saboteurs.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights that attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American prom culture reaches into university life: freshmen offered to arrive on a private plane
We're pleased to be able to respond to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arrival at the university, the company also offers such transportation options as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had considered security.
The service is a perfect alternative for students who usually have to haul their stuff across the country in dangerously overloaded cars.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year's students get to college with minimum effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that since the service was new, no orders had been received, but added that "students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks".
The company also said that while students are charged £9,000 a year for tuition, it hopes to find a market for the service.
Students today are very different from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what you need.
However, the National Union of Students has criticized the service as being disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS's vice president for higher education, said: "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will be starting university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, where affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants is not keeping up with the skyrocketing costs of basic necessities, before they can even begin to think about spending thousands of pounds on something like a simple dorm arrival.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
People raise their hands, chanting "hands up, don't shoot" as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and drew national attention, Peres saw white women's responses that focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women in the immediate aftermath of the August 9th killings, personal essays with headlines like "Ferguson Thoughts from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.
But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege on such a high level", she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis that we're facing, and because it's so racially connected, they felt that they needed to point it out.
For Coretta Mitchell Ferguson, an English professor at Ohio State University, he has laid bare the issues that black women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell says.
When I write about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships in public, but not safe in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now integrate issues of race and gender into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, almost always on the basis of the rape of a white woman", said Hatter.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify the lynching.
In Hatter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all their eggs in the basket for women's suffrage, and black suffrage was going to come later", Hatty said.
Looking back on things like this gives us a clearer picture of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything right.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Association of Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came about almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell's view, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" on issues that black women had been coping with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists who have this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now starting to understand what that means.
Notorious white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook two weeks after the Michael Brown murder to post a scathing article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, who demanded that white Americans take a greater role in protesting racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason for understanding the dangers of the body - and perspectives on racial issues that differ substantially in public opinion polls - will lead the change", Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates a more cross-cutting feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her comments about race in America still surprise some.
Entrepreneur Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinem's remarks about Ferguson contradict criticism she has made earlier.
Now, we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, "Watch My Brother", to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, it was met with an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only issue that pushes the traditional feminist frontline.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform has resurfaced again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women to support immigration reform, said that to present this issue as important to women, all she needed to do was share stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], the women who come with them are put in a position to be vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are resonating with women's organizations", she said.
Ipswich house with pig for sale
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by estate agents when it was found to be a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120,000, a detached one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was distinguished by a photograph of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Connells Real Estate has reported that the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has since been removed", the company said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique detached one-bedroom house".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it still appears in its promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some people asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you feel about your overall performance in the Grand Slam this year?
Of course, I'm glad I won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked the stability, especially in the end of some matches.
I'm upset now, of course.
I didn't even make it to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After a humiliating defeat, I have a huge motivation to take things to the next level.
I have a lot of work to do, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year on a high.
The Asian Series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on physical culture, sports and youth affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed for the implementation of the norms of GTO to give bonuses at the entrance to the universities.
He said that the rules would be the same as they were in the Soviet era - people would have to pass the rules for lifting, running and other exercises.
We will remind, 12 Russian subjects will begin to implement the GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also suggested to the students who passed the GTO to give bonuses when entering the universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, you can give them a little extra credit on their SAT scores.
There are also proposals to give extra leave to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the town of Harvey in South Wales , a new millionaire has emerged after winning the lottery .
The lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky winner will take home almost $1.1 million from Saturday night's lottery draw.
The Harvey Newsstand is bringing home the gold in the grand prize draw for the second time in five years, with the last winner's share of $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to make his mark.
The shop's owner, Steve Forward, said the win had created a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought a win like that might be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the grand prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of five millionaires in August, following the Belmont couple's $7.5 million jackpot just a few weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and have reported that winning has given them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
Harvey's Millionaire brings the number of Western Australian jackpot winners to 59 this year, with a total of $85 million in winnings.
Economic Development Ministry wants to accelerate growth of electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of ecologically clean transport in Russia, said the deputy director of the department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table, which was held by "Vedomosti" at the Moscow Auto Salon - 2014.
The plan was commissioned by the government, and one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available in "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
The challenge is to develop criteria for evaluating electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government, describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; a scheme for concessional lending and concessional leasing will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, encourage localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes to regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in car parks, petrol stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport during 2015 - in the form of giving it advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand the state procurement of such transport.
Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development will introduce criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally clean transport, the development of charging infrastructure into the list of indicators of assessment of the activities of regional authorities by October 2014.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013 around 100 electric vehicles were sold in the country.
The import duty on electric cars was reduced to zero in early 2014, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts Mitsubishi Motors' chief executive in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But even five-fold growth does not make electric cars noticeable: in 2013, according to the European Business Association, 2.78 million passenger and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors is importing electric cars into Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company is primarily focused on corporate customers, says Nicolas Rémiz, director of strategic planning and partnerships for Renault in Russia.
Most other electric vehicle manufacturers have taken a wait-and-see attitude toward Russia.
Developments of electric vehicles are also made by Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is poor.
For example, in January - July 2014, according to "ASM-holding", "AvtoVAZ" produced 30 electric cars.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric cars, admits the director of engineering of "AutoVAZ" Sergey Amanov, without state support, there will be no breakthrough in this segment....
The development of the Russian electric car market, in addition to the high cost of cars (those electric cars sold in Russia are on average twice as expensive as their counterparts with internal combustion engines), holds back the underdeveloped charging infrastructure (fuel - units), sigh the general director of "Autostat" Sergei Tselykov.
Due to the high cost and low rates of decrease in cost, electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Autoreview" Mikhail Podorzhansky, and Celikov agrees with him.
Car manufacturers, on the other hand, say that some electric car models are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this, in particular, will be facilitated by the appearance of new charging stations, stresses the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rosseti": several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will appear soon.
The construction of the gas station network is also being negotiated with other regions.
According to Rosneft's director Vladimir Sofin, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build filling stations across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, and the possibility of doing so in relation to the charging of electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric car market in Russia to be the elimination of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, the expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is being discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangibly as customs preferences, according to Pankov.
Transportation taxes in Russia are low, says Pankov, in contrast to Norway, for example, where the tax cuts have led to a surge in sales of electric cars, which now account for 12 percent of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the ability to move electric vehicles in designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 aircraft crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people on board were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
The survivors were taken to a hospital.
The crash occurred a few miles from the runway of Denver International Airport.
The cause of the tragedy is being established.
In the Donetsk region, they are dealing with the captive militants of the "Donbass" battalion.
The Caraters are surrounded at Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of their forces were killed in the firing squad.
Those who survived say that if they had known what the situation in southeastern Ukraine really was, they would not have gone to war.
The 108 prisoners are lucky.
The punishers of the Donbass Battalion remained alive after the "meat-cutting" in which they were caught near Ilovaisk.
In the encirclement of the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, the militants spent several days, practically abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters informed that the "ring" could be exited through the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally, after a few minutes, shells and bullets were heard from all sides.
"According to the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave", says the acting deputy commander of the battalion, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we between the Multipol and Chervoneselsky went down into the valley, there was a crossfire from anti-tank guided missiles, from "zushkas", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars ahead of me and three behind me, and then there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were injured, many died later.
The survivors are now being treated by the very people they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicine.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and put them on a path to true death.
They say we're just being betrayed.
The column, the whole battalion, to be destroyed.
Like many of his comrades, Alexei joined the Donbass battalion as a volunteer, as Ukrainian news reports reported atrocities allegedly committed by "separatists" in the southeast.
Here, Alexei saw a very different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk - and not by anyone, but by Ukrainian soldiers.
A friend called me and told me that there was a mortar fire, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, - one of the soldiers, Alexei, tells.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
We were kept in Ilovaisk, told we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, and I've already written my report.
We were taken from Zurachov to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "pot" near Ilovaisk.
Some survivors now admit that if they could turn back the clock, they would not have joined the punitive battalion.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
A food-price-restriction headquarters has been established in the region
A headquarters has been established in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, which will, if necessary, limit the rise in food prices in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the regional government, representatives of the executive power and supervisory agencies.
They'll all be monitoring the prices of agricultural products in the region.
Warta Ekonomica - Will Kiev compensate Rosneft for the $140 million it lost?
Rosneft chief Igor Sechin said the company estimates the damage from shelling the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said that in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will be negotiating with the Ukrainian government for compensation", Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the Lisichanskaya refinery, which was modernized by the company, was planned for 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no 'rebels who dug in', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the process oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared", he said.
On July 18, the oil storage tank at the Lisich refinery was firebombed and two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisichany refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to the Lisichansk refinery were suspended due to its loss-making.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft acquired the Lisichany refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-VR.
The DPRK has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, the blast occurred at about 10:30 a.m. local time from Changdong Province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff told Interfax that the missile is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, August 29, but there was no panic this time.
The ruble continued to fall and even updated the historical maximum to the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the worsening of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, so far, this seems more like a fake hysteria, inflated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for new sanctions against Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the two-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we don't see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may adjust.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue the "Ideal-tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" has filed a lawsuit against "Ideal-Tour" for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
We're talking about two cases that are scheduled for October.
There will be different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
It's worth a little over 425 million rubles.
The hearing is set for October 7th.
The second application was filed on August 18.
It is 4.24 billion rubles.
The hearing is set for October 2nd.
According to the journalists at the Russian Union of the Travel Industry, the judges on the cases are different.
In July, the media reported that Ideal-tour owed Orenburg Airlines 1.5 billion rubles.
The CEO of the airline Viktor Zyukin says the amount is 1.6 billion rubles.
The director of Aeroflot, Vitaly Savelyev, says that the amount is even greater - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting for new users
Twitter has changed its sign-up process to make it easier for new users to actively engage with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be able to browse through a large number of recommended accounts when they sign up to form their own Twitter circle.
The recommendations are based on the interests indicated when the application was submitted.
Twitter automatically sets a checkmark on the subscription for all automatically selected accounts.
This will force the user to manually remove the tickers so that they do not read those that they are not interested in.
Whereas users of the microblogging service used to see only avatars of recommended users, Twitter is now sampling one of the blogger's popular tweets to help build an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter login page in the last three years.
Twitter has been working hard on upgrading its service recently.
This activity is primarily due to the ongoing efforts of the service to achieve loss-free.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in readership.
The company is in desperate need of more loyal customers, who, once in, would stay.
It's the only way to ensure a steady stream of advertising revenue.
Moscow 's Science Day will be bright and rainy
On September 1, the weather in the Moscow region will be cool and rainy throughout the day, meteorologists say.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow region - 13-18 degrees.

The car recycling program resumed on September 1
The program for the disposal of cars in Russia will resume on September 1.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for this purpose.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will cover all cars over six years old.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand rubles for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Russia has already implemented a similar program to dispose of cars.
The main difference of the current project, explained the minister, is that now it is assumed not only the disposal of cars to receive a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, in case the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when handing over the old one in the "trade-in" at the dealer, reports "Interfax".
The previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011, cost over 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the level of production of cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101,4% in relation to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator is releasing a game about modern journalism.
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the Coming Out Simulator game, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only now that it's been widely publicized.
The game was inspired by the events in Ferguson, where protests are currently underway after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the as-yet-untitled project will be how news coverage impacts the consequences of stories.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in the areas where clashes between the police and the population are taking place.
The hero can take a lot of different shots of what's happening, which will affect the outcome.
If he can shoot a scene where the police look like heroes and the protesters look like thugs, the police will treat him better and let him go where the average person can't go.
If he reports differently, his photos could turn a peaceful protest into a full-scale riot.
The points in the game will be gained through the hero's Twitter account, which will have new followers if the photos posted there are popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, has published an image that demonstrates how an event can change depending on how the photograph of it is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been considering the concept of such a game for quite some time, but initially wanted to focus it not on the protests in the US, but on the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media coverage of Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the events.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who publishes browser games.
His most notable project is the 2014 Coming Out Simulator.
The game, which follows events from Case's own biography, focuses on a bisexual teenager trying to come to terms with his relationship with his homophobic parents.
Gelatei is dragging Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
By calling for preparations for another "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Gelety is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
"In Moscow, of course, paid attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valery Heletey, who said about" the completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists "and the beginning of the" Great Patriotic War ", the losses in which will be calculated by" tens of thousands. "
The degree of adequacy of the head of Ukraine's military department, who published the post on his Facebook page, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field", the Russian diplomats said.
They find it hard to believe that such statements could come from the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian defense minister wrote on Monday: "The Russian side has already threatened several times through unofficial channels that they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us if resistance continues".
He also said that the "operation to liberate eastern Ukraine" was complete.
Perez Hilton has removed all intimate photos of stars and apologized .
Today, more than 60 Hollywood stars were terrified.
Hackers hacked into the primitive passwords of iCloud (data storage) in smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on the website of the blogger Perez Hilton.
Not for long, really.
Let's just say that Jennifer Lawrence's official representative has already reported the theft of her cell phone photos and confirmed that all the photos that are "glowing" online are genuine.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid website of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her fellow employees for publishing their candid photos, according to The Independent.
No, no one made me do it.
I haven't been contacted by any of their agents.
And now I'm going to delete the naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice", the blogger wrote on Twitter.
However, all the candid photos of the stars have already been leaked online.

Tony Stewart crashes on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track was completed a little more than halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire ruptured on lap 172 ending his performance.
Stuart drove his dilapidated car into the garage and then left without speaking to reporters.
His team manager Chad Johnston said the 14 members of the team are upset, but will now focus on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there had been a more successful attempt and a more successful finish for him", said Johnston.
We'll go to Richmond and hopefully do better there.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush that required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty high expectation of successfully coming to the finish", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded onto the tow truck, and the team was assembled and ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car struck and killed another driver during a race on a dirt track in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next races in Richmond to take part in the Chase.
He returned to work during the investigation of the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had come out to express his displeasure to Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash will continue for at least another two weeks.
The decision whether to charge Stewart has not been made.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud cheers and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting from 12th, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, finishing in fourth.
Then on the 122 lap after the restart, the number of Bush.
Car 18 went off the track at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zvanetski in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are currently in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not fail to report in her Instagram.
However, one photograph surprised and confused many of the couple's fans.
The picture was taken at Zvanetsky's.
"At breakfast at the home of Mikhail Mikhalych Zvanetskiy, Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) #odessa", - signed the photo by Ksenia Sobchak.
But there's nothing on the table but cigarettes.
No coffee, no bread, no butter, no anything like that.
The couple's fans thought that Ksusha was a smoker too, and they condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?", "Smoking kills!", "What a cigarette breakfast"), "It seems like breakfast, but only cigarettes are on the table))) ", "Ksenia, do you smoke too?", - the subscribers of her blog were excited about their favorite.
Recall that recently Sobchak boasted about what a delicious dinner Maxim Vitorgan cooked for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the country, and your husband has prepared dinner for your arrival (for the first time in married life, so how delicious. The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he does not say in the words of the joke: "that now it is like this every day", - boasted her husband Ksenia Sobchak.
The picture shows Maxim busy cooking, and the table is already served with salted meat and roast chicken.
Prison officials in Bulgaria held a national protest rally
Hundreds of prison officials from across Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the country's capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for the return of the previous working conditions, which have recently been changed.
The salary increase is also among the demands that will be discussed with acting justice minister Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the old 24-hour shifts.
Although the prison workers' union met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice on several occasions, no agreement was reached, according to Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, said the head of the Main Directorate for the Execution of Punishments, Rossen Zhelyazkov.
The protest is expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The army controls the new Thai government
General Prajut (right) has appointed Minister of Defence Wrangit Wongsuwan (left)
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-o-cha, announced the country's new cabinet, with more than a third of the posts held by generals or retired generals.
Army representatives were given key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs, and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-ocha was formally confirmed as the Prime Minister after the King of Thailand formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the post of prime minister.
He was elected prime minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Previously, the army appointed the deputies of the parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-Ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chenawat.
Officially, Praut Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister, as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are concerns that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22nd.
against the backdrop of a complete paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinnawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army removed the prime minister's brother Yinglik Chinwat Thaksin.
Both are popular among rural populations, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has ensured their success in elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the city's elite have joined the anti-government movement that has paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said they'd be better in salad, I didn't promise you that, jokes the waitress from the new Palm Brewery.
You have to admit it's true, but your mind and stomach are still hard.
We all know that when we say "Belgium" we mean "Belgium".
Restaurant owners like to make the profound statement that the success of a restaurant depends on three things: location, location, and location.
There are places that are not so well located, and even great, but some unlucky.
Anyway, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that there used to be a cafe "Gorodok" (in honor of that same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bojol" and a beer "Druzhba".
Now there's a beer hall again, but not nostalgically Soviet, but Belgian.
Above ground, only the tip of the iceberg: a bar counter and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is deprived even of a hint of sunlight.
But it's as fun as a nursery: red, yellow and green walls, colorful chairs, instead of windows, TVs, where mermaids swim.
Belgian restaurants in St. Petersburg are old fashioned, so there's a lot to compare them to.
There are eight kinds of beer (rolls 260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, saying that "shrimps are big, fat seeds", and it should be noted that the service, despite some shortcomings, is the most positive aspect of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, can foresee that a meat loaf with Walloon prune (280 rubles) is actually carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper seems ugly thick compared to it.
You can only taste something if you eat half a plate at a time.
Salads are worse.
The classic Liège (260) would be best described as a crime against the Belgian people: some old iceberg, some potatoes cooked a long time ago, some Kenyan beans that have been uncooked, some old-fashioned bacon chips, and some pickled onions.
You wouldn't want to meet anyone with a Liège salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients in the Belgian salad was somewhat different, but the impression was not as positive.
If you could turn a blind eye to unripe tomatoes, cherries, or overcooked champignons, why do mussels look as if they've been thawed and thawed several times in their lifetimes?
I know, there are some perfectly normal white-water clams here.
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one with the white wine, celery and carrots, it's not exactly a hit.
There's vegetables, but no flavor, and whether there was wine is a mystery.
But the fries with homemade mayonnaise are good for the clams.
Chicken water here is not a crust, thick enough to be the first or second dish you have in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked by a local chef in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
The verification showed the opposite: the rosemary was overpowering.
It was thought that this rabbit had been fed exclusively with rosemary bushes during its lifetime, which is why the meat had such an unusual aroma.
But there was a wonderful-- no, just a wonderful pear in a caramelized crust attached to the rabbit's foot.
Waffles at Palm are not only sweet, but also full-bodied - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The cloves are too watery, and the waffles are dry.
But the manager who came to the table asked very informally about the dinner experience.
Then you should come back.
The dollar rose above 37 rubles on the news of the new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
That's a new record.
The dollar rose by "tomorrow" at 10:29 Moscow time by 26.9 cents and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro rate rose by 30 cents - to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The two-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the rouble is long-term, both in relation to the euro and to the dollar.
The long-term forecast was this high, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything about Ukraine will be reflected in the exchange rate.
As long as this continues, investors will respond.
Today, the rumors of a troop invasion have not been confirmed by either side, but the market has been very emotional.
Any talk that he was resistant to such news was crossed out yesterday.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close at these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax season is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all these are links in the same chain.
The inflation is also forecast to accelerate: to the current prices for the autumn will be added from 5 to 10%.
Soon, too, the seasonal fruit and vegetables will be gone, and there will be a vacuum until the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there is no powerful hysteria, - comments the head of the market analysis department of "Open Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.
It remains to be seen whether the promised sanctions will be imposed on Saturday, as NATO meets.
The ruble, he said, weakened sharply after the tax season ended, followed by news about Ukraine, and the Central Bank said last week that it would completely switch to floating exchange rates by the end of the year and would abandon any currency intervention.
If we look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the 37 ruble mark, - continues the analyst.
So, there's nothing big going on in terms of turnover.
The currency market was in a worrying time, with an increased demand for currency in late January and the third of March when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the ruble's weakening.
First of all, this is the increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in import prices, says the chief analyst of the UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
The negative aspects include the rise in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a consequence, become the cause of an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, hinders the development of the country's economy.
Speaking of the stock market, the devaluation of the ruble is somewhat offsetting the decline in share prices expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell by 1.67 percent during Thursday's trading, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.
Such a significant difference in the relative value of the decline in indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually fade, and ruble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We think that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar", - said Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
The Briton said she had spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Carin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of inherited disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK has reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with TMD because so little is known about the condition.
An estimated 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have TNM, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait and pinched toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, meaning that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be in a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and dead by the time she was 30.
A mother of two who is now 51 years old said: "As a child, I knew I could not do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time to do everything.
I could never skateboard or skate with other kids, and I was teased a lot at school for the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to free her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor came out of the room, and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I had put my nose where it shouldn't have been, and so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library, and wrote to the AF Association", she said.
When I got the information back, I was shocked and I had the most horrible panic that I could ever have had.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18, and I'd be dead by the time I was 25, and I'd be gradually losing all my abilities in the meantime.
I was going through it alone, and I was planning my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk hadn't deteriorated as much as she had thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, put his arm around me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you would be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, they found a tumor in her.
"When he explained what an STI was, I thought I had a lucky ticket", she said.
The UK TMS charity has announced TMS Information Month to try and bring attention to the disease.
The tax burden on Washington area businesses is rising as the economy recovers.
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in Maryland, Virginia and the District collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The state and local business tax burden last year increased 4.3 percent to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when bills were lower, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by the professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenue comes from corporate taxes.
Virginia, at 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from business owners.
The increase in tax revenue is largely due to a return to the value of companies' real estate, say the researchers, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row when growth was less than 1 percent.
While the largest portion of this revenue is coming from large states like California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same is happening in the Washington, D.C., area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia combined paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the previous year.
However, the observed return on property value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Virginia and D.C. companies pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the state's Taxation Center.
So Maryland has to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent surge in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also seem to be improving, according to this data.
Companies in the region reported state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenues, the most in the region.
Although trends are in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a below-average tax revenue increase of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each of which had the same corporate rate), at 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower state and local taxes for entrepreneurs and, overall, a more favorable climate for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not assessed in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as well as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this legislation could raise the corporate income tax rate to as high as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the D.C. area seem to be doing better and thus paying more in state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
The taxes paid to entrepreneurs as individual income taxes by small business owners -- the transitional structure that most small businesses follow -- in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say the trend and the rise in business tax revenues across the country is likely to continue this year, with state and local government sales tax revenues up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington D.C. area may be lagging behind, as the decline in federal spending is affecting the region's labor market.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship in judo brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze medals.
The Russians were only behind the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg, won the title.
In the final match against Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by just one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, silver was awarded to Mikhail Pullaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost the world champion of 2011 and 2013 to the Japanese Masai Ebinu.
Khan-Maghomedov, who lost to a fellow compatriot in the quarterfinal stage, triumphed in the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze medal.
In the women's tournament, Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the podium in the 52 kg category.
In the semi-final, she lost to the reigning world champion Maylinde Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended her title.
In the bronze medal match, Kuzyutina beat Ma Inang of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she had hoped for.
And once again, the obstacle on the way to the gold was the Russian, who beat Kuzjutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, bronze was placed in the coffers of the Russian national team by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, he was offended by former Moldovan player Viktor Skovorsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov was playing in the domestic championship with a calf injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break in the competition.
As for the former Moldovan Skwortzov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who took the sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko, finished with bronze in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Championships also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In a tough battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmidt due to a remark from his rival.
On Friday, the tournament was played with three sets of awards, but the Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Vostrov, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the consolation final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Vosorosov could not go to the tatami due to an injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put into the team's coffers by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
So ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the world championship title in the team competitions was played.
Both the Russian national teams - men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fairer sex were unlucky - they did not reach the medal.
And the Russian judoka won team silver.
In the decisive match, they lost 2-3 to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
At the same time , the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and a willful - Denis Yartsov (weight up to 73 kg).
However , in the heavier weight classes , Murat Habachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) were unable to cope with their Japanese rivals .
The bronze match in the women's tournament followed the same scenario, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese team - 2-3.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk were attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was obvious that you could become champions", Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the ancestors of judo, there's nothing wrong with that.
But I'm sure you can beat them.
The Russian national team performed much better at the home world championship than they did a year ago at competitions of similar level held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yeah, I want to win gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, then he is a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in such a sport as judo", - summed up the results of the tournament the Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are cited by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese team was the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various ranks, five of which were gold.
The next World Cup will be held in Astana next summer.

Joan Rivers' family is hoping for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after receiving an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under close observation until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "severe".
The response was widespread, including numerous online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can be a king.
Royal Blood's debut album is on sale, a new hope for British rock that has taken rock duos from clubs straight into stadiums.
Royal Blood have only been on the scene for a year, but they've already been nominated for a BBC Music Award, toured with Arctic Monkeys and even had Jimmy Page in the dressing room at a New York concert.
Their self-titled debut album had received 100,000 pre-orders just months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current lamentable state of the music industry, this is a very unusual situation, because it's not just another Lana Del Rey or another sweet-mouthed representative of the new R'n'B, but it's a pair of bullish-looking Britons playing with a level of volume and intensity that was last in vogue a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album, in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been fully justified.
The duo has taken a name that could be tampered with, except by some desperate hairy metal-smiths, and the blood of some kings, as they think, runs in their veins, too.
Of course, this is all about the heroes of the past Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set out to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.
It's probably too early to make any predictions about the success of this venture, but there are some things that can be said.
Ten songs, crammed into thirty minutes or so, is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the qualities of the individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line but by the drum part.
The musicians joke that it's easier to play the song on the piano than it is to play it on the piano.
Also notable are the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a hard rock party, but when played in sequence, they all blend into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, in fact, it's the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they don't claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (more likely they are aiming at the successors of Motörhead), but have brought out numerous rock duos from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is designed for stadiums, in a space designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously cramped.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented in the early zeroes of The White Stripes.
But it's not just the instruments, it's the approach to songwriting.
The heroes of retro-rock zeroes with great difficulty chose outside the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance went to the point of recognizing themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sound so powerful and arrogant that this effort successfully drapes some of the secondary and hard-headedness of the musical material.
After all, who says rock has to be smart?
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Friday morning: The online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the billion-dollar sale of Twitch to Google seemed like a done deal, and it seemed like a natural fit.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a generic streaming service, a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time gaming", according to Business Insider.
The twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which know-it-all give (mostly old) games a "mystery theater" treatment, is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with a lukewarm reception, a classic example of an established tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal fell through, given that he was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster".
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For a snob like me who says he'd rather do sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games instead of holding a joystick.
It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. while she's crawling through Resident Evil, it's another to watch some stranger get shot 20 times in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so watching them being shot without controlling your own viewing angle can be a recipe for a Do It Right headache.
I agree that the speed-up in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time is entertaining.
But if it's not a game virtuoso or a comic, it's unlikely that his Twitch channel is going to be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it's the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to make money on this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would fold into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
But Twitch has something that any company would love to have: the young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the channel shows no signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectator sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the surviving hostages - almost all of them are now students, with the parents of the dead, with the caretaker of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the "Mothers of Beslan" committee Susanna Dudiyeva, who took part in the special operation by a member of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the "Obszty" department Elizaveta Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Already returned to Moscow, met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "V" department of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What struck me most about this project was that Beslan was as if it had not been there for ten years.
This is a painful subject for anyone who has anything to do with it, and people are having a hard time talking about what happened.
The experience of the trip is very heavy.
But we must not forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job", said Antonova.
The special project is prepared by the infographic studio of the holding company Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects have been dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's stay in power.

North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, reports Renhap.
The launch was made around 10:30 a.m. local time from the Chagando Province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.

Deputies suggested to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma has introduced a draft law that would move the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is listed in the lower house's legislative database.
It was authored by State Duma deputies Vadim Daygin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Just Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (CPRF), and was supported by the Russian Federation.
According to the authors of the initiative, such a change will contribute to more efficient and effective ensuring the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, which lawmakers are rushing to enact, requires that personal data of Russians processed via the Internet be stored in the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate information about the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of Russian data protection law based on a court decision.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offender sites - the automated information system "Registry of data subjects' rights violators".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Dygin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Degengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill to postpone the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in Russia will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems with the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data storage facilities in the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, Mail Group, Western companies, which today already provide their servers".
"There are also several independent data centres willing to cooperate in this area", he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems - they will get technological opportunities for deployment", Levin concluded.
The controversial bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives personal data subjects - citizens of the Russian Federation - of the right to dispose of their own data by imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. must be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, the applicant can choose the territory in which the activities will be carried out.
The adoption of similar privacy localization bills in other countries has led to the demise of global services and significant economic losses.
The test subject with a bucket of ice water sprained her jaw .
Isabel Roberts of Great Britain screamed when ice water was poured on her head, damaging the bone structure of her face.
That test with the ice bucket didn't go over well.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so loud during a test with a bucket of ice water that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so furiously when she was poured ice water on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I was screaming, but when I did it, my jaw started to freeze", she told The Mirror.
Water's poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident .
I tried to shut my mouth, but it wouldn't shut, it stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister had the same realization, and they started to laugh, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to hospital to have her jaw repaired after participating in a popular charade on Tuesday.
The video went viral and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The "Novorossiya Army" claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27 and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement
As of 10:00 on September 1, the militia handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead servicemen.
This was reported to "Interfax" by a representative of the press service of the "Army of Novorossia".
He added that "air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereshka shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreement".
According to the agency's interlocutor, the Ukrainian side used cluster munitions, prohibited by international conventions, during the artillery shelling of the Lugansk airport.
A spokesman for the press service said that the militia managed to damage two Ukrainian Air Force helicopters on one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The enemy's losses in the living force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered as prisoners", - summed up the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of the Donbas announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side of 223 captured servicemen and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine within the framework of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", the DPR army "prevented the attempts of the national guardsmen to withdraw heavy equipment from the encircled area in violation of previously reached agreements".
The militia then reported destroying two tanks and two armoured vehicles in a short battle, capturing six tanks and disarming 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Lugansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
Late last week, a large group of Ukrainian servicemen found themselves surrounded by militia in the Ilovaysk area of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release the Ukrainian servicemen from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on condition that the enemy surrendered weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen troops began to leave the besieged settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, who fell into the siege, 14 more people came out of the "cottage" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that the wounded Ukrainians are "in captivity at the 137th regiment of the 32nd Russian Federation Division and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are being treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures if the EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian foreign ministry said the European Council's "conclusions" of August 30 showed the EU member states' inability to overcome the inertia of their unrelenting support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unsubstantiated allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country", according to the agency's website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is being influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying the confrontation with Russia.
The EU's foreign policy chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, said the EU was "committed to the peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine and to ensuring full-fledged dialogue between the warring parties".
The website also notes that there is no objective assessment of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is growing.
Recall that during the next seven days in the European Union is planned to develop specific proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
The EU's representatives are working closely with US officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures imposed between them by duration and degree of rigidity.
New EU sanctions may affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on college textbooks
With the cost of college textbooks for many students exceeding $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, soon to be a sophomore, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books to high school students, offering them a nominal fee to delay their sale.
"My calculus textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A", says 19-year-old Schroeder, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Board, the average student spends over $1200 a year on textbooks and supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shopping and creative ideas, like Schroeder's system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, and often costing significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, says book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores were rented during the past spring semester, says Trevor Meyer, Nibo's vice president.
Less than half of all books are purchased from university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Bookstores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a good deal.
Shopping in an online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you'd see in a college bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 in the pre-order price, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying used
If you don't mind the stains or the damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form at Chegg.com.
Matt Cassady, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a secondhand copy of the textbook "Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business".
The book was selling for $48 new.
For example, faculty members, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, suggest that students ask their professors if they can use older publications.
Sometimes updates aren't essential to the class.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
The rent .
It's worth considering if you're going to rent a textbook, if you're going to treat it well enough, if you're going to remember to return it, and if you're not going to want to keep it after the course is over.
You can save over 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the bookstore where you buy books, including any fines you may be issued for notations, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.
Sometimes, such books are rented out by purchasing a digital license for a period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rent for "Mathematical Analysis" on Chegg.com for six months is about $61.
Bracey says that literature students can often find the best prices, as many classics are now free to download, while science and engineering literature can be very expensive.
Anyway, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29, who is about to start law school at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as it ensures that you are looking for the exact text you need.
Before ordering online, says Golt, be sure to check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
The delivery of the book he had purchased was delayed by four weeks, and he eventually paid full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says the Fund for the Development of the Far East is completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reported.
"15 billion rubles and remained lying on deposits", - said the President.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of priority development territories in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary to create the TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, had not approved the list of priority development territories in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving the region's transport accessibility, removing infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create conditions for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of advanced development, which should become competitive with respect to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
We've been told that the Emerging Territory could replace the E.E.Z.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office.
Sylvester Stallone's Unstoppable 3 returned less than $30 million of its $90 million US budget, while Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing For only brought back $12 million of its $70 million budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz brought in only $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's movies like "How to Train Your Dragon 2" also disappointed in their revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year ever in terms of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "working" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film that went into summer with at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20th, for 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both moviegoers and film critics, suggest that this year's film crop is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website, "I think times are changing".
We have to face that and not try to chase the past.
In contrast to the current drop in box office collections in Hollywood, Netflix's revenue from its streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost doubling from last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the "collapse" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy predictions had a grain of truth.
With several potential box office hits coming in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other industry figures are more optimistic.
"People X" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office receipts simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter, "Next summer will be the biggest summer in box office history, and no one will care about it".
Food sanctions do not scare restaurant owners with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants with European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And in general, the public prefer to replace the forbidden imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"It's better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella", says chef Mariano Valerio of the Barlotti Italian restaurant, complaining about the quality of the cheeses his suppliers offer him instead of Italian.
Morella and burrata cheese were the first to go in the restaurant, they have a short shelf life.
We should have enough Parmesan to last us another couple of months.
What do you do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio's eyes are so clear, the shocking memories still haunt him.
The meat was on the carts, just a foot above the floor!
There's cats!
The rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we would never buy anything from the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things are different now.
But the other day, I got a sample of fish from the Far East.
So she's a little weak!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many things that are common for Italy are strange for a Russian manufacturer.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, they hang the meat in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1 to 2 degrees.
It needs to be suspended to soften, to relax the muscles.
I did all that with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get such a nice piece of meat?"
I said, it's yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anybody do that?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti, the French restaurant Brasserie Most has a stop-list in the kitchen that lists the missing products: French oysters, sea urchins.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Arrow" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses the restaurant will buy Swiss.
Regis, however, is more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Coloured cabbage - 200 rubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too".
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
We buy oysters in the Far East by weight, but they live 15-20 years, you know how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it's a delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scare stories for foreign chefs.
The standard story is, "The first three months were good, then the quality dropped dramatically".
Main complaint: Russian suppliers can't stand the stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don't know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

The sanctioned menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are called mainly food sanctions.
The country is banned from importing beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurts, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have begun a battle with suppliers: food prices have risen, and it is urgent to look for counterparts from other countries.
The most affected will be the expensive restaurants with single-kitchens in France, Italy, Spain, which were supplied directly from the "mother" countries.
The community has had to rebuild before.
For example, when Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014, and a year earlier, American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers were able to supply beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer 2014 were much more serious.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that remove from the ban the young Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Italian Valerio hopes the sanctions can be eased.
Meanwhile, some restaurants are in a state of uncertainty.
According to EastWest, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Drag restaurants will have to change their menu to what is produced by local farmers and other countries", says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur and owner of Restconsult.
If the chef is strong, it won't be a problem for him.
Only we don't have many of those chefs, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from Brasserie Most is ready for this: we'll have to give up 10-15% of the dishes, and rework the other half of the menu.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, people are already starting to substitute beef strogans for marble beef steak, says Sergei Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian, Serbian, Argentinian, Tunisian, Chilean cheeses", says Oxana Glibchuk, a representative of the East-West company.
European milk products and cream are also produced in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the U.S. can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and trout from Norway by salmon, trout, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European produce can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, the offerings from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, it will be easier for budget chain restaurants to rebuild than the premium segment: there are hardly any gourmets who can distinguish Italian morza from Russian morza.
Although it's hard to get the Ginza Project institutions to do that, he thinks.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace", says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Coffee shop owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones.
But there are many restaurants that will be barely affected by the sanctions.
These include Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani cuisines from the CIS countries.
"Georgian cuisine is not about expensive food", says Hatuna Kolbaja, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vay me!".
All our cheeses are made in Russia, many dishes are based on chicken fillet, we do not use exotic greens".
The Kolbais haven't removed a single dish from their menu yet.
Timur Lansky, owner of the "Chai Khon N1" restaurant with Uzbek cuisine, is not bothered by the sanctions either: he will only have to exchange lamb for New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, - he says.
You can get sliced lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits from the CIS for less.
And what they bring from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
You know, the Uzbek tomatoes are known to be delicious, sweet.
No one says that about the Spanish.
After the sanctions were imposed, Uzbekistan's Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources representative Olimboy Artykov said that he plans to double the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to substitute European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants that responded to the Money request have also been fairly quiet about the sanctions.
McDonald's' press service said that localization is above 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Supplier Department at Subway Russia, about 80% of the network's products are purchased in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products, which are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctioned products" generally accounted for no more than 4%.
They didn't even touch the sanctions on the Walker noodles.
KFC, Burger King and Chicken Potatoes did not respond to the "Money" request, but other market participants claim that the degree of localization of Burger King is significantly less than that of McDonald's.
With no Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are more willing to buy Chilean than Russian Far Eastern
On his hump
Meanwhile, restaurateurs complain that the increase in demand is driving up prices even for local produce.
"The prices of food for Grable have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cher Mirio - by twice", says restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, Kolbaia admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have increased in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August".
"Brazil suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork", complains Sergei Rak, deputy general manager of Stardogs.
Chicken nuggets are up 35%.
We're waiting for the Chinese prices to cool off the hot Brazilian heads.
There's going to be an 8% price hike at the Stardog in the near future.
"It's already very unnecessary to raise prices", says Rak.
According to statistics, the growth in the revenue of the public catering for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
That's the lowest since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurateurs have stockpiled food for the next two months in the hope of surviving the price fluctuations.
But what happens in two months, nobody knows.
In the square in front of the Moscow City Hall, there are a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the stage, the musicians are playing the waltz.
It's a regional food festival with a fun name, "There's a time to eat".
"We had been planning to do a festival of local food for a long time, but now we are facing sanctions, so we hurried and organized a festival", says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of macaroni and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on making borscht with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow "Lenin name Sovhoz", cheese from the Russian-born Italian Jay Clouse.
"Restaurant salmon can be replaced with other species of salmon from the Far East", says Phillip Galkin, owner of the Svojimi fish shop.
We have a big catch of the nerk, the cuttlefish, the chihuahua, the humpback, the king salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't move.
And you can't hold our salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic
In the window of his tent are shrimps with "Magadan" turkey, codfish, omul, muksun, mussels from the Crimea, crayfish from the Far East.
Galkin thinks it's time to move on to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch in Russia in 2013 was more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
The import of fish in 2013 is about 800 thousand tons.
The "Svoye people" store has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, and before the introduction of sanctions, it served another 15 restaurants, such as "Simple things".
Now, Galkin's got applications from 15 more restaurants.
We could make the same kind of sushi with our fish, he says.
We got tired, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through the online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
To confirm, I have a Philadelphia with ketchup in the Galkin tent.
Unlike the rolls with the samgai, these have to be chewed longer, but the knowledge that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
The website of the "Your People" store even has coats and sea bass rolls.
In sushi bars, though, they're replacing Norwegian salmon with Chilean.
Galkin explains that cooks are slow to come up with new recipes using Far Eastern fish.
"We have not yet been offered Russian fish by suppliers", - explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Yevseev.
It's the same with other products: Russian producers could have taken the vacant niche, but they don't.
According to Boris Akimov, the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, now we can talk more about the replacement of imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations that have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace the illegal imports unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit first of all the large producers of other countries", says Akimov.
However, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal in the past month than food sanctions.
Following the results of mass unscheduled inspections by the Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the substance of the claims to determine what actions are necessary to ensure that the restaurants reopen to customers as soon as possible", McDonald's told Denham.
Nobody really knows what's going to happen.
If it's limited to food sanctions, that's one option that can be survived", said an employee of a restaurant consulting company, speaking on condition of anonymity.
If they start shutting down McDonald's all over the country, it's a very different scenario.
"Euro-protocol" instead of the GIBD reference
Payments for the helmet can be received without a certificate from the State Road Traffic Safety Administration - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "euro protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive, according to which from September 1 this year to receive payments for insurance, the insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate of the GIBD.
We are talking about only those cases where the accident was registered according to the "Euro protocol" without the participation of the traffic police.
So if there were only two cars involved in the accident, no physical injuries, the damage is within the limit, and both drivers have reached an agreement as to who is to blame for the accident.
From August 2, the payment limit under the "euro protocol" will be 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often, even in the case of minor injuries, in situations where accidents can be reported under the "Euro-protocol", drivers involved in an accident call the police.
Because if you had a policy, you couldn't get a refund without a GIBD certificate.
The parameters set out in the draft directive are precisely intended to remove this obstacle to the implementation of the "euro protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment for a casco in connection with an accident, filed without the GIBDD employees, should not be lower than the limit under the "euro protocol".
But it cannot be higher than the limit specified in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically capable of relieving both the employees of the DPS and the road.
But it is unlikely to impress motorists or insurance companies.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of fraud, which could be increased by the introduction of new rules for cask payments.
As for the drivers, it's hard to imagine the work that will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver will usually wait for hours for the inspector to report a minor accident, because it's more secure.
And it is not yet known whether it will be easier to defeat the fraudsters or to convince the drivers of the reliability of the "Euro-protocol".
Savings certificate will be made nameless and irrevocable
The Treasury wants to ban bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them the equivalent of a deposit.
The Treasury is drafting a bill that would ban bearer bonds.
Recently, this instrument has become popular, as the rates are higher than for bank deposits.
The fact is that the deposit-taker certificates are not covered by the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since it is not necessary to make contributions to the deposit insurance fund (DSA).
The irony is that this move is being made because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and will affect Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, controls 98% of the market.
The Bank of Moscow's share, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the ASB explains, is that customers of a small bank who have bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of its license, try to get money from the ASB.
Some investors, not being financially literate, may buy bearer certificates of savings and assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the event of a license revocation by the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency's practice, there have been cases where holders of pre-emption certificates have tried to recover insurance compensation through the court", the ASA said.
The problem is obviously far-fetched.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, because they have no legal right to compensation from the state.
If it were the case that the instrument was not insured in the ASV, then the ban would have been applied to the metal accounts, on which citizens' funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are not covered by the deposit insurance system, but their existence has not been questioned.
The thing is, most likely, that bearer bonds are a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-asset.
However, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any bank customer can buy a certificate, pass it on to any citizen, and many owners can change before cashing such a certificate.
It is no accident that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a securities of a specific name, which must be kept in a depository.
To give the banks a taste of the pill, such certificates are allowed to be issued without a right to early repayment.
So, it's the sort of no-return deposit that bankers have been dreaming of for a long time.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There was a protest this weekend against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following the developments for us over the weekend and has spoken to protesters who have come from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany will send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the terrorist group "Islamic state", ITAR-TASS reports on August 31 with reference to the decision adopted following a meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reportedly sending 30 Milan anti-tank missile systems and 500 rounds of ammunition to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made until the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros for humanitarian aid to Iraq.
On September 1st, Ms. Merkel will address the Bundestag with a government statement on this subject.
So far, Germany has not delivered its weapons to the "hot spots".
German residents are divided over the issue of arms being sent to Iraq.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that these weapons could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia has sunk a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militiamen have shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31.
According to available data, it happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Nameless (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report shelling of two coast guard boats.
It is stated that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
The teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains.
TWO teenage bushwalkers were airlifted to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike shortly after noon on Sunday at Gowett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they didn't come home.
A search party, consisting of local police and a rescue squad, was sent out and the couple was found around 11pm near Bridal Vale Waterfall.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were lifted on a stretcher Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two alliances have met
The Minsk summit did not solve the problems for which it was convened, but it did create a new format: the leaders of the European Union met the leaders of the future Eurasian Union.
For the first time, the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot issues", albeit for a worrying reason (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerating delays).
Whether such a structure can work effectively is unclear; it is clear who took the cream off this summit.
Questions about this matter came to a head on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and then other Eurasians with Europeans, saw the new president Lukashenko on the news.
The Belarusian leader was an example of refined politeness, the behavior of a man who had just won the jackpot - and plans for a dignified old age in high society.
How the Maidan has helped Lukashenko
The arrival of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) to Minsk, who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf, is not just a legitimization of the 20-year-old president.
It is a request for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Melyantsov, is confident that from now on, Brussels will not be able to speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met face-to-face with Lukashenko gives grounds to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw", he told "Ogniko".
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakthrough was started by the Belarusian authorities long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results were achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization", the Ogynka interlocutor lists, "and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The states even lifted some of the sanctions.
As for the events in Ukraine, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership have only fueled this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbas with all the severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union, nor the CSTO, and in Baranowice there is a Russian air base.
Brussels and Washington have noticed the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and have assessed it, Belarusian experts are sure.
The success of Lukashenka's drive for political diversification will be seen by how often Minsk will host EU+EU meetings in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, could not immediately respond to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maya Kosyancic only told "The Light" that in the context of resolving the issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, reports have emerged that Kazakhstan may be the next venue for the meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The last straw for Minsk was President Nursultan Nazarbayev's statement in which he admitted that he was personally asked by the European Union representatives.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings in the Russia-OSCE-Ukraine format, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
It means that the "last dictator of Europe" is now a hand-picked European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, came to the conclusion that the main reason for the summit was not the tragic situation in Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable drawn up at the meeting for future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the Customs Union countries on the EU-Ukraine association agreement looks like a bigger achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gucht, however, said EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around".
However, it seems that the crisis in Ukraine is also "working" on Belarus in the economy.
Its consequences - and first and foremost the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is still under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuvers.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, former presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation bypassing sanctions.
At the same time, the supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit has urged Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes, - emphasized Romanchuk "Fire", - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They worked long on the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second story, the expert continues, is that many Ukrainian companies are keen to start production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials, also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production-trading schemes may now be in high demand".
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the platform for EU and CU negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU's agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at €5-10 billion, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only €125 million in compensation.
The Belarusian president may propose that Brussels work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenka's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the format of the TC + EU is dismissed, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any hassle to discuss, not from the bay-barakhta to take a decision, after signing the Association Treaty with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that moment", he addressed Petro Poroshenko before the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to appease Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when organizing the interaction of the EU and the Customs Union on its land, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation of a unified economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, is put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation", - said "Ognoku" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the department where recently scrupulously choosing words.
Zones with paid entry may appear in Moscow
The Moscow government is considering the possibility of introducing zones with paid entrance as a method to combat the overcrowding of central roads in the same way as in other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the deputy mayor of Moscow for transport issues Maksim Liksutov.
One option that has proven successful is the paid entrance.
It's an expert opinion, and we'll definitely look at it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made", Liksutov said.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar to Moscow in structure and activity, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the solutions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring road, which is already being implemented, Liksutov added.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of how not all traffic needs to pass through Moscow.
If there was sufficient infrastructure for the bypass, then there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow", the deputy mayor said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov stated that the introduction of paid parking lots has significantly relieved the capital's streets.
And, he says, the city's authorities are not planning to stop there.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CRA).
♪ Boredom is sinful ♪
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City 2: A Woman Worth Killing did not make the kind of revolution that one might expect.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if by thesis we understand the universe of noir, and by antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on, it should read: "thesis-antithesis-chaos".
Sin City 2 is chaotic both dramatically and philosophically, both times it's chaotic in the dumbest sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, here, the gromila Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life in the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to catch - in the role of this folk trooper - from the air knives and other ax blows with swords.
But the old men are literally being elbowed by the newcomers, like they're barging into town from some other movie, whose plot and meaning are not to be bothered about.
Well, his story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, by the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His is with the hot-tempered Eva Lord and the vengeful Dwight.
But this confusion in which Dwight, say, is indistinguishable from Johnny in the face - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are interwoven with the characters with an inexorable regularity - is not a misfortune, nor even a half-misfortune.
They're not people, we know they're the archetypes of the noir: the doom-bitch, the overconfident gambler, the honey-trapped sex detective, the corrupt ass- Senator.
Well, when the archetype dances with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's not a movie anymore, but abstract painting.
Asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this chaotic world, there's something constant.
The fighting whores of the first City still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness that besiege their native slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan is not, well, not, and he'll look at the fireplace, and Bruce Willis is always a sight to behold.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is something else.
Frank Miller was good in that as an artist he brilliantly combined comics and noir, and as a director he reversed the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposed realities.
The comic book phenomenon in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when Deshill Hammett's novels The Bloody Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931) created the canon of the noir, then called the hard-boiled school.
Or pulp fiction, for that matter.
Comics have given Hollywood dozens of heroes, from the sea-faring Popeye, a spinach-eater who gives him heroic powers, to Superman, Batman, and the whining Dick Tracy, to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "avengers".
But in any comic book movie, there was something wrong: the characters were so stubbornly unwilling to become flesh on screen, they remained pawns in the "real" world around them, whether they wanted to or not.
In short, they were completely devoid of "existence".
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals, and historical backdrop - lost all credibility.
What Forsythes, what Thibaux and Rugan-Macare, what even the Balkans and Rostov are after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
This novel has quietly mutated into the soap opera format, and the crime novel - that is, by definition, the marginal novel - has risen to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett has had a firsthand experience of being a medic on the front line.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, there were at least close to the party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Lousi, Edward Dmitrick.
So the archetype of the noir they've set is, first, rude and cynical, and second, purely social.
It's almost like an American version of social realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable in that it was unnatural, but organically connected comic book with noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not shy of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of a corrupt world, where a cardinal ordered murder and a senator covered up a monstrous sadistic son, was well worth Hammet's pen.
And the painted details, like the severed heads that the sadist used to decorate his nest, the pen of the genius of James Ellroy, author of The Black Orchid, and the best - that is, the most declaratively nauseating - representative of the neon.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical stylistic to the comic book tradition.
I guess that's largely because of 3D technology.
When you watch the second Sin City, you feel like you're trapped inside a glass ball, and the snow is covering up a toy cloak.
Often it's not snow, but bloody rags, but what's the big deal?
Well, there's nothing to be said for sociability.
It's only possible if somewhere, somewhere, even if it's on the edge of a dirty swamp, there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who has gone astray, or, say, tell her parents that her perpetrator has been punished.
When there is nothing but sin in the city, then sin is no longer sin, but a norm.
Boring as all the norm.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is boring.
In fairness, the domestic market has given this new sin a small but perch.
Warning: The film contains harmful smoking scenes.
Compared to the show, in the most vegetarian episode where a man is pinched to break his fingers, it's a hell of a joke.
Hammett would have loved that.
French socialists must "shut up and put France in order", says key ally of François Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to "show a warmth" to the embattled socialist president, whose reshuffling has not been approved by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said, to applause.
As a gesture of conciliation, the Prime Minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the conflict-fuelling proposals it had to weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his fellow Socialist Party members to remain "united" with the government.
But Christian Tobiara, the minister of justice, put the cart in the air by attending a meeting of dissident Socialist Party members of parliament and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not imagine that the new Wall government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the naked king, but so is Prince Manuel Valls, who is forced to form a new government after the previous one failed to last a summer.
"And the new one will not last either autumn or winter", Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win the snap elections and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in March's municipal elections, while the far-right National Front came first in May's EU elections.
A poll by Sunday's Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Hollande's presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrin, a political scientist at the University of Siens Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel that something is changing quickly", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The city without drugs has no case
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court has left without consideration the claim of the regional directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management to the "City without Drugs" fund.
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as payment for the rent of the building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region has left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MGIS) to the "City without Drugs" fund (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman).
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to recover from the organization 7.3 million rubles as payment for the lease of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff has failed to appear in court twice, which is why the decision was made to dismiss the case.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the Directorate of the MUGISO could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
The foundation's representatives were also unable to be contacted.
We are talking about the mansion that the foundation occupied in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 on a non-repayable basis since 2011.
Such a decision was made by the ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Administrative Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit in the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded that the contract for the free use of the mansion-monument be declared unconcluded by the court.
According to the Directorate of the MUGISO, the agreement did not include any substantial conditions for the lease of the cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
The foundation then appealed the decision to the same court, which was not satisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation in the High Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, according to which the foundation again began to pay the rent, the city's mayor, Evgeny Roizman, told.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles a month.
The previous provincial administration gave us this building for free, recognizing our contribution to the war on drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided otherwise", he said.
I'm not sure what to do.
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the city Duma of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city Duma, Evgeny Roizman, to resign.
The case was initiated against the arrested on suspicion of murder of a pensioner, a deputy of the city Duma, Oleg Kinev, who is considered an associate of the mayor.
How the criminal case against Yevgenia Roizman was found
On July 1, it became known that a criminal case was opened for the fact of "slander" (Article 128.1 of the Russian Criminal Code) in the blog of the mayor of Ekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the "Protection" legal center Anna Filatova applied with a corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
They're turning iPhones into wallets.
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to unveil its newest products, the press is getting more and more leaks about what to expect from the unveiling.
Citing sources, US media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project between Apple and the payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re / code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 smartphone will have a mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves decline to comment on the matter.
This feature allows you to pay at the checkout using your smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user's fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
The iPhone is reportedly the first to have NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows for contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the checkout counter.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC function was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that are part of the so-called NFC Forum - an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC - Samsung Nexus S - was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with their Android smartphone.
However, US experts point out that despite the large investments made by high-tech companies in advancing NFC technology, US retailers are still wary of innovation and are reluctant to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
So now, the hope is that Apple's entry into this market will actually force retailers to step up and implement this technology more actively in their stores.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on supplying Mistral to Russia remains unchanged
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romén Nadal said Paris's position on Russia's supply of Mistral helicopter carriers was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on 20 August: 'Today the level of sanctions does not impede supply.
This is a decision of Europeans, not France"", - quotes Mr. Nadal "RIA Novosti".
That's how a French foreign ministry official responded to a question about whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in Paris' position on the contract.

The National Security Council of Ukraine: seven servicemen were killed in the zone of the force operation in the past 24 hours
The representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Andriy Lysenko reported that seven Ukrainian servicemen were killed and 25 were wounded in the past 24 hours in the zone of hostilities in the east of the country.
The situation under Ilovaisk is extremely complex.
Until the operation to remove the troops from the encirclement is completed, the details will not be made public.
Once the operation is complete, the details of the casualties and the causes of the situation will be made public.
Those responsible for this situation will be held accountable", Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss in more detail the situation at Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the National Security Council, "everything is being done to return the captured soldiers", reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military had withdrawn from the airport of Lugansk in the direction of the settlement of Georgievka.

Norwegian Cruise is nearing a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for an estimated $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.
The deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to luxury cruise ships and Prestige Cruises' enriched customers, as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said Sunday, warning that the talks could still fail.
Prestige Cruises' owner, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources requested anonymity as the talks are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative for Apollo declined to comment on the report.
Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported $1.2 billion in revenue in 2013, up 6 percent from the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies like China and India in the years ahead.
The racing companies are looking to position themselves as the cruise operators that these new customers prefer.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the majority shareholder of the company after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 as a result of a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was converted into a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company as of the end of June, according to the filing.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to filings from Prestige Cruises' initial public offering.
The Krym broadcasting company may receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the state broadcasting company "Crimea" in 2014.
According to the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, posted on the single portal for disclosure of information about the preparation of regulatory acts, subsidies are planned to be spent "to cover the costs of creating conditions for a large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of a modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
The money will also go towards the purchase of equipment, the repair of the roof and the energy supply systems in the building of the broadcasting company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Hong Kong democracy movement activists disrupt Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress on Sunday outlined a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first win the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which will likely be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and forced pro-democracy activists to once again promise to shut down Hong Kong's financial hub with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing's publication of a document describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
The briefing is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China House of People's Representatives Zhang Rongshuang and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists have announced that they will gather outside the Hong Kong head of government building this afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the final days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities announced their intention to annex 400 hectares of land on the West Bank belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
The decision to annex the land to South Bethlehem was motivated by a desire to avenge the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year, according to the BBC.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure of the territory on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to Gaza spokesman Saeb Arikat, the international community should hold Israel accountable for "continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands that Kiev start talks on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin talks on "statehood" for the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to begin negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the bloodshed began five months ago: Help the separatists take back territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly declared territory of Novorossiya de facto independence to align with Russia, rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin condemned Ukraine's military campaign to retake separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently dubbed the captured territory Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that evokes the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes that peace talks will happen in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians are starting campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and as government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is "a prisoner of illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to respect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's words about statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy, which had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to assuage fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights were in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin spokesman's intervention to correct a "misinterpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to treat the separatist insurgency in the east differently than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have had to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of its 6.5 million residents are non-Russian, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for remaining inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have been discussing at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over the territory that would connect the mainland of Russia to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main naval fleet, as well as commercial maritime establishments and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov Oblast and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers consider amending the constitution after new elections to give the breakaway regions greater control over their finances and language status.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whom Moscow is accused of arming and inciting.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders as equals followed fresh rebel attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have seized control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This has entailed a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a steel-making port of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazov and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a gathering of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take specific action; leaders called for drawing up a draft of harsher sanctions against Russia that would be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged Sunday for 10 Russian airborne troops captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.
The nude photo scandal has captured the attention of Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco.
Jeffrey Edelstein has expressed his disgust at the hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée, Gaby Greco, and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of explicit photos of Jennifer Lawrence in the nude went viral as a result of a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have access to some 60 nude photos of "Hunger Games" star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michele, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of the iCloud leak.
There's 101 names on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greco last month, told Confidential, "This is disgusting".
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking was "shameful" and that those who were targeted "feel invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend, Scott Speedman, including two of her lying naked by the pool.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of Chuck Strachowsky and actress of Forbidden Reception Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A spokesperson for Lawrence told TMZ, "This is a blatant invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his anger at the hacker, tweeting: "Posting stolen cell phone photos is no different than actually selling stolen goods".
Just from a legal point of view, we can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
Potential celebrity nude theft has been discovered.
The massive hacking of celebrity accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario was described by The Next Web.
A script in Python was published on Github that allowed users to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of your iPhone.
It uses the same Apple ID and password to access it as the Apple iCloud, from which the stolen celebrity photos were taken.
The script allowed the password retrieval method from Find My Phone.
This method consists of sequentially entering all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The script author claimed that the number of password variants that can be entered in the Find My Phone service is unlimited.
With a properly set up security system, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be locked and the user should be notified of the hacking attempt.
Due to the vulnerability, users received no reports of attempts to guess the password for their account.
The hackers got the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a tweet by Hackapp, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripted password-generating program was written to it.
The vulnerability is currently closed, after five attempts, the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp user and he noted that the above vulnerability is common to many services, but noted that he has no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the "star" account.
It's not me, plz RT
The Prime Minister's Twitter account has been compromised once again.
While there is no hard evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service in the past.
Hackers intercepted the device's controls and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Earlier, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter account was also hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the above manner, then the password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service could be stored there as well.
The Next Web was unable to receive Apple's comment on the Find My Phone vulnerability.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-man team
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and applied to the Federation of modern pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cup events, won the silver medal at the European Championships in the individual event and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of the program in this sport.
She has maintained her lead in the current season.
According to the rules, to perform at the Olympic Games-2016 in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain a special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lvov, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world in blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the Ukrainian women 's team , she won the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
The CRC has stopped investigating the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (SCR) has closed the criminal case on the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the flight engineer.
Forensic examination revealed that the crash was caused by excessive landing speed, failure of the crew to perform standard landing procedures, and an unintentional release of the engines to increased speed of direct thrust.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline, which was flying Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled off the runway and caught fire.
The aircraft's commander, co-pilot and flight engineer were killed on the spot.
The two crew members were taken to a hospital, where they later died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants were hospitalized with severe injuries and underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, who was moving at the time of the accident on the Kiev highway, suffered serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transportation prosecutor's office conducted an investigation of the Red Wings after the crash, during which numerous violations were revealed.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Emelianenko started training in the prison
A well-known Russian mixed martial artist, 33-year-old Alexander Emelianenko, who is in detention for sexual assault against a domestic worker, has fully recovered from his injuries and has started training.
This is the championship report.
In May this year, the Investigative Committee of Russia charged Alexander Yemelyanenko with rape.
The suspect was declared wanted, on May 9, he was detained in Tambov after committing a road traffic accident, as a result of which he received a hip fracture.

Anger has become the most universal and functional emotion in man.
Angry facial expressions are biologically universal to humans, and each organ and muscle group involved in their creation is not random, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, Australian and U.S. scientists have found.
They reported their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and a brief summary of their findings can be found in a news release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - raised and downward-sloping brows, thinly lined lips, and swollen nostrils - are common in all cultures, even among children who are blind from birth and have never seen him, notes lead researcher Aaron Sell.
In a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion is created to effectively manage conflict.
The more physical damage one person can inflict on another, the more they have the ability to dictate their terms, and they communicate that to the other person through anger.
The researchers also found evidence for another hypothesis: Physically strong people are more likely to be angry and aggressive, to believe that they have the right to impose conditions that are not favorable to them, and to prefer violent conflict resolution over peaceful conflict resolution.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a "bargaining emotion", the researchers decided that the movements of each of the seven groups of muscles that produce an angry facial expression should make the angry individual appear more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force him to agree to his terms as soon as possible in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers created a computer simulation of a face that had or had not each of the seven elements of an angry face, and showed them to the informants.
While lowered eyebrows and a raised chin alone did not make the face evil, the study participants unanimously agreed that the person depicted with these features was physically stronger.
In humans, as in animals, anger is a threat: an exaggerated display of one's own power, compelling one to comply and submit.
A man puffs his nostrils and presses his lips together for the same purpose as a frog who puffs himself up or a baboon who flaunts his fangs.
"Anger is triggered by the refusal of the other person to accept the situation, and the person immediately adopts a form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face are arbitrary, they all express the same thing", noted anthropologist John Tooby.
The Ministry of Communications has proposed to allocate 250 million rubles to the "Crimea" TV and radio company
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization "Crimean Teleradio Company" in 2014.
This is stated in the draft government decree prepared by the agency, which was seen by "Lenta.ru".
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of a modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment".
In particular, the allocated money is supposed to re-equip the hardware-studio block, video walls, central hardware and video server room.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
In addition, the company will use the funds to pay for the use of the fiber-optic communication line (FOPL) and the repair of the energy system.
The subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget allocated to the Ministry of Communications.
The state broadcasting company "Crimea" was established in 1959, broadcasting in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
