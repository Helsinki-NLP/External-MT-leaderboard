28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead In San Francisco Shopping Center
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead this week in the staircase of a local shopping center.
But the victim's brother said he didn't think he might be someone who wanted to hurt him, saying, "At the end things went well for him."
The San Francisco Judicial Medical Authority announced Wednesday morning that the body found in the Westfield Shopping Center was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Security Directorate said the cause of death was identified as a murder and the investigation was ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC station in San Francisco KGO that Frank, who was previously working as the chef of the kitchen department in Boston, began to work as the chef of the kitchen department in San Francisco Sons & Daughters, getting his dream job six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters official said that the death "turned themselves and they were extremely sad."
The spokesman said, "We are a small team working here like a tight family and he will miss it very much."
In this difficult time, we want to point out that Frank’s family is not alone and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia pointed out that Frank was staying in the hostels at the beginning and said, "At the end things went well for him."
Louis Galicia told KGO, "He held an apartment and went out with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn’t think he might be someone who could want to hurt his little brother.
He was a gentle man with a great heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to make food for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He didn’t like to go to Monaco.
My brother adjusted to every situation.
He said, "While everything else in the world goes unclean, it is this unprocessed ointment that glows every day."
The information holders were asked to call the SFPD Notification Line by phone number 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors strike: new job slowing calls
Representatives of assistant doctors asked their trade unions to give work slowing permission in connection with a dispute about a new contract.
The British Association of Physicians (BMA) Assistant Physicians Committee (JDC) called on the General Council to support more work slowing action from the beginning of September.
JDC said ministers could not resolve concerns about the contract.
The assistant doctors and medical students used a reverse vote in the contract agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of voters.
In a post posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "continuously silent" on the issues that led to the contract's rejection.
He said: "In light of this, the JDC Board voted for a complete rejection of the proposed new contract and called for a re-initiation of formal negotiations on concerns."
The JDC administration, in response to the government's silence, made an official request for the BMA Board to allow a program to increase the slowdown of work from the beginning of September.
The dispute caused the assistant doctors to participate in six strikes this year, including the cessation of the first topic in the NHS history.
Assistant Doctor Leader at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a vote of rejection of the contractual conditions proposed by BMA.
54,000 assistant doctors and medical students told BMA members during meetings prior to voting that this was a good deal to be accepted.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be implemented in a way that would apply to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: A ‘negative alliance’?
This is an end to the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey gathered on Tuesday to hold hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war with words and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish counterpart in the spectacular hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I got the clear impression that the party who most wanted this agreement was Ankara.
The hand was stuck, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile was quite weak and it was unlikely to say that even against his own limited standards he spread any heat.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has repeatedly mentioned Mr. Putin as a “good friend,” five times according to a report.
I was surprised by the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to a pre-crisis level, but will reach a much higher level.
The next day, in a newspaper here, it was stated that Mr. Erdoğan behaved as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his excitement showed the opposite.
But Mr. Putin’s cold blast showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement was the cause of the crisis: the Turkey's crash of a Russian war aircraft on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Russia was intense.
Mr. Putin accused Ankara of scratching Moscow from his back.
The anger was much greater, the other side was thought to be a friend.
It will be difficult to rebuild trust in the real sense, impossible.
Since November, the Russian people’s mind has changed.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara in a tremendous and aggressive way for months.
Suddenly, the guilty of everything became Turks.
The most serious of these were the accusations of senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s family gained profits from illegal oil trade in the areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He clearly denied it.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was that it was time to continue the journey.
Finally, the reason for this meeting was that Mr. Putin received the apology from President Erdogan.
Russia can see it as a victory.
The benefits of the call for a ceasefire for Ankara are very clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup that took place last month and will almost lead to his revenge.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also greatly affected him.
Economic reasons are also effective.
The sanctions imposed by Russia strictly hit, especially the prohibition of private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the coastal areas of Turkey each year.
This number dropped by 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies have definitely relaxed with the continuation of flights.
They are linked to the end of the season intensity in the Mediterranean.
And this week, the state television predicted a decline in the prices of fruits and vegetables with the re-autorisation of imports of Turkish agricultural products.
If we would quote a news in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
But the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it does not find the response to the coup attempt sufficient.
As it is added to the anger that the negotiations on joining the United States have long been heard due to the progress in a scandalous pace, Mr. Putin, who wants to take advantage of Turkey’s breakdown of ties with the West and the cold between them, is taking action.
The Russian leader appears to have surely gathered sympathy from Ankara due to the call for support from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
It should not be forgotten that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which was also a root fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this spectacular palace on the shore, represents a "coalition of disadvantages" as an analyst of Russia and Turkey explained to me: it unites the forces of the two countries that the West rejects and behaves badly.
Nevertheless, despite the image of this consensus displayed, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important is about Syria: although Moscow shows itself as a mediator, Russia and Turkey are supporting different sides.
After the first three-hour talks, the two presidents said they did not discuss the issue in a press conference.
While the President of Turkey clearly avoided to answer a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to draw the gold of these.
There is no clear consensus on how the common ground will be determined in Syria.
But after months of clearly continued discourse – and taking into account the absolute catastrophic potential arising from the NATO member Turkey’s shooting and defeat of the Russian aircraft – the two leaders have at least begun to talk is definitely a good development.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland
According to the statement of the chairman of the executive board of the bank, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is related to the bank’s global goals.
Eight years ago, he had to go back and give up.
During this time, brand strategy experts used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the Six National Rugby Championships to the Wimbledon Championship Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that more national brands would be right.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers but no new starts will be made.
All references to RBS, except in the United Kingdom and Wales, except in the case of central and stock exchange quotation, will be replaced by NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take a much more dominant task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour held for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC told Scotland: "As we will be a bank of more brands from now on, the RBS brand will no longer be our investor brand and the brand where our staff are employed."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
We are no longer global but local goals.
Each of these brands will appear somewhat differently in the community where they are, and our staff will work under the name of customers and these brands.
RBS has announced that it will not continue to sponsor the Six National Championships and that it is upgrading the profile of different brands about sports sponsorship.
The chairman of the executive board said, "Now it's time we move to the brand bank understanding because (we were asking ourselves) how can we make it a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago, if we had stated that we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would offer these brands, I would find it ridiculous.
But I think you will see a lot of change with the work we do and focusing on the needs of our customers, not ourselves.
We can reactivate these brands, so I think it’s the right time.
Frankie Dettori won 3,000 times with Predilection in Newmarket.
Dettori exploded champagne after achieving his 3,000th victory with double success in Newmarket
Jokey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in England on Friday at Newmarket.
On the local track, with Predilection trained by John Gosden, he won the second victory of the night and reached this kilometre stone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jokey who reaches this kilometre stone on an uninterrupted run.
He follows the traces of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Jokey, who previously won three championships in Ghayyar, said: "This is a special situation."
I was so excited that my family was here.
I am really happy to be in this newmarket that I started 30 years ago.
This is not an important meeting, not a Royal Ascot – a ordinary Friday night with just 20,000 people.
I feel relaxed and relaxed.
Dettori accepted the manifestations by bringing Predilection after victory
There were two jokes that reached this kilometre stone in the disabled race: champion jokes Richard Johnson and retired jokes Sir Anthony McCoy, who won more than 4,300 victories in his record-filled career and 20 times champion.
Lester Piggott, who won the derby nine times, has won 4493 victories in his career.
Frankie is one of the best jokes of our time and it is not surprising that he reaches a kilometre stone that only a few people have reached before him.
A stylish and powerful person, but the tactical mentality that he has the element that allows him to press heavily from others in the layer.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way, with his excitement and charism on this subject, he has attracted people to this sport for years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that he could have reached the 6,000th victory if he wasn’t a jokey competing only on weekends and big races.
Seriously, Frankie spent much of his 30 years competing in the UK with victories that’s great to see.
He has a very exciting character and is a very good feature for these English races but beyond that an extraordinary jokey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this kilometre stone as a symbol by jumping down by jumping down.
Frankie Dettori, with many moves from jumping to jumping to landing, has been the symbol of the English run without barriers for twenty years.
This was a way full of descent.
In 1996, he survived a plane crash while winning many major races, including his famous "Big Seven" victory at Ascot, and was banned because he did not comply with the drug prohibition.
Three years ago, while he had difficulties at first during his return from the six-month removal process, he demonstrated that he had a strong character as needed to remove the suspects and get back to the best.
And it could continue for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to continue to compete at least until the age of 50.
Russian President Putin resigns private pen Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly withdrawn the private pen Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov has been a part of Mr. Putin’s close surroundings for many years.
The 63-year-old, now appointed as a special representative for environmental and transportation issues.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said "Ivanov's decision to terminate his office as responsible for the Russian administration" but no reason was given.
Anton Vaino has been appointed as deputy to Mr. Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, 44 years old, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the Department of International Relations (MGIMO) of the renowned Moscow State Institute and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
He was later concerned with the presidential protocol and the administration of government staff; the statements on the Kremlin website are in this form (Russian).
After his appointment, Mr. Putin said, “Thank you for trusting me.”
I think the administration’s most important task is to support your activities as the head of state in terms of law enforcement and monitoring the implementation of instructions.
Mr. Putin told the Russian television channel on Friday that he wanted Mr. Ivanov to be resigned and suggested Mr. Vaino to be replaced.
Smiles are convincing?
This is an excitement for Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov has long been working as one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, and the Soviet security forces, like him, served the KGB.
He was one of the strongest people in the country as a private pen.
In a meeting with President Putin and broadcast on state television, both said that the private pen was withdrawn by their own will.
But despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, very few people have convinced it, especially in this period when parliamentary elections are approaching.
Is this a dispute that arises from a type of power struggle?
No one knows this yet.
But the official statement that a person who could be president would suddenly want to guide Russia’s environmental policy was welcomed with great doubts.
According to a quote on the Kremlin’s website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin: “In a speech at the beginning of 2012, it is true that I ask you to trust me for four years for this challenging – even problematic – mission.
Well, I seem to have been in the office of the president’s special pen for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took this task in December 2011.
He has previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Ministry of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces like Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Mr. Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr. Ivanov advocated him.
When Mr. Putin came to power, he showed Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Since Mr. Putin's third term of presidency is contrary to the constitution, it was believed that Mr. Ivanov could become President after Mr. Putin's second term.
But this task was transferred to Putin's other close ally Dmitry Medvedev.
Mr. Putin was the prime minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson has been expelled after shooting the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical struggle in the series set last month in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced in a joint statement that he was dismissed.
Gibson, who plays the special agent Aaron Hotchner, had issued an apology on Tuesday before the annulment was made.
In the set there were differences and controversies regarding creative subjects.
In a statement, he said, “I am sad that such an event happened.”
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, detailed information about how Gibson's character will be removed from the show that follows a group of FBI agents will be provided in the future.
The 54-year-old actress, who was previously involved in the Dharma & Greg situation comedy, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
In a statement released on Friday, Gibson said, “I love Criminal Minds and I have worked on giving it my heart and soul for the past twelve years.”
I would like to stay until the end, but that is no longer possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our great team and, most importantly, the best supporters that a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screen on September 28 for the 12th season.
The Mystery of the Fish in the Banff Garden
A man living in the Banff area asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in the Banff garden.
Kevin Bain believes that this 75 fish may be a sand fish that is transported by a seafood.
Bain, who lives 500 meters away from the sea, posted the images on Periscope with the hope that someone will keep light on the appearance of two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Pass: The Bridge is now connected to Fife
A project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017
The engineers combined the north and the width of the Queensferry Pass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of the four closures between the "slip fan" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The cutting of the bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project worth £1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017.
Economist Keith Brown became one of the first people to walk from ground to bridge by visiting the facilities today.
He said, “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We are all witnessing the engineering in a truly distant scale with this project used more than 30,000 tons of concrete for the construction of just this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge closing the gap between the widow and the bridge plate, it is a sensitive study that requires extremely sensitive tolerances for this harmony.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge plate is placed, the first piece of the plate will be cast in concrete today in Rosyth, which means that the whole plate will be ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Forth Pass and Bridge Contractors Project Director Michael Martin said: “In all bridge projects, the first closure is always an important kilometre stone.
In this extraordinary project, this closure represents the leadership in construction engineering.
After the last road board was also placed and connected to the extending North Tower level, we had to close the emptiness on the north-or black-side.
This was also achieved by the retreat of the northern width up to 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a very big but also very sensitive process.
The reason for its greatness was that the widget was 222 meters long, weighing 6,000 tons and needed to be pulled around 3 percent in a curve.
The reason for his sensitivity was that the tolerance values that the team should follow were very low; only up to a few millimeters on both sides.
Fortunately everything went well.
Moelfre Gulf rescue team: Three men are lucky because they’re alive
Three men were “lucky to be alive” after they fell from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station issued a warning at 13:20 on Friday after the incident in the Moelfre Gulf.
Three men were trying to swim toward a safe area while their boats continued their own way.
Moelfre rescue fleet control officer said, "We saw the boat drawn the right apartments for them and we were worried."
He added, “We had gone away with strong winds until they came on their way.”
Two of the men were rescued by a local fisherman’s boat, while the third man, 60 years old, was found tired and stabbed in a shamander without a jacket.
They were all brought to the rescue fleet and brought to the rescue fleet station.
Mr. Jones said: “Three men who fell into the water are lucky to be alive and have never been injured.
The boat engine had an emergency stop cable, but when the boat is alabora, it must have been somehow disconnected from the person using the boat.
Three people were watching it today.
A valuable kind of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It is really surprising to see how the world is changing.
The fact that young people and children no longer go out to play, prefer to spend their free time looking at the screens, was a situation that most people have been sad over the past decade.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move up from the sofa.
The time spent looking at the screens, primarily limited to television, spread over time to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is really great to see that technology and moving in the open air are not elements that exclude each other.
Of course, I’m talking about Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that was first created for video games in the 1990s (this later turned into cartoon series, game cards and other side-products).
Like many phenomena of popular culture, this new game was also joined when it was presented in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the presentation in other countries was delayed due to the intense interest that caused overload on the servers.
Over the days, Pokémon Go Tinder has reached more and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out to Pokémon as they follow with GPS by taking their smartphones, and they can 'take the photo' of what they find (by taking a screen image on the phone) or 'take them'.
He joined this madness by getting out of the sofa for a generation looking for the game at a younger age.
In the United States, the game has made a remarkable increase in the number of steps a "mediate" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app that was developed for Apple Watch and followed by 35,000 users, recently that among those who followed the game within two days after it was presented to the Washington Post, the percentage of people exercising 30 days a day increased from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at the level of exercise.
Most public health campaigns that encourage people to "dive 30 minutes of time", "stay out of the couch" and "be active every day" were ignored because most public health messages were boring and transmitted by people that seem to be devastated.
However, the importance of exercise is less emphasized.
People who exercise regularly have a lower risk of cancer or depression.
It helps in topics such as exercise, weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and has a long list of benefits that cannot be listed here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it takes people out to do something they enjoy.
Three basic elements of health are also met in this way: movement, clean air and fun with sunlight.
Some people can even get new friends during the hunting.
As usual, there are also untouched gamblers who are looking for something to complain.
And, of course, someone can also knock at the door while walking.
What does it matter?
A great innovation was presented.
Even though smartphones apps like Fitbit watch our movement, they don’t offer us a reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of the innovation will pass and the use will decrease over time.
But due to the success of Pokémon, many games will be released, which will help people who get out through the combination of applications and virtual reality with activities in the real world to be more active, in shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold medal in the women's gymnastics general assessment
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles has an immunity to all of this.
Dynamics of jumping.
Comfortable in the tool.
Surprising with the earth.
It is perfect at first.
He is an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast, who completed the overall assessment on Thursday as the first, clearly showed the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
In total, 62,198 points were far above the silver medal owner and his friend from the "Last Five" team, Aly Raisman, and the Russian bronze medal owner, Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles, from the United States, showed performance in the balance instrument at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics women's artistic gymnastics general evaluation final held on Thursday in Brazil.
Biles was the fourth and fifth American woman who received the general assessment award backwards and announced her name as the best of her generation and all time.
When the last total was published, he drowned in his tears and the long journey he went out to reach this main ended.
This success brought the sport to the same level as athletes like Michael Phelps, which can be seen once in every generation that reaches new levels:
Billes spent his last three years as one of the most successful of this sport with a mixture of ambition and sensitivity that allowed him to call himself "the best gymnast I've ever seen" with 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton.
A last test in Brazil was waiting for him; the competition was among him and the burden of great expectations, much more than being among Biles and other people in the field.
Texas would seem disappointed to return to the family house in Spring with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles, from the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving gold and silver medals, respectively, on Thursday, August, in the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil.
Biles won the first day on Tuesday when the national team coordinator Martha Karolyi, who retired, served as a celebration sign in the goodbye party.
Although the balls insist when they never look forward in this long run towards the top, this is not exactly true.
The part, which also includes the slurry passage that has become the symbol of the ground exercise routine, is prepared with Latin music that will perfectly adapt to the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl discovered by the mother of Boorman on a trip to a gym in which Aimee Boorman was trained, which was born as a younger child by her grandmother and grandfather, became a power.
Since the summer of 2013, he has not lost any of the general reviews; this is a series of victories that he must continue as long as the Balles wishes.
Although Mustafina took the lead in two rotations, it was temporary.
The balance instruments and ground exercises that Biles took over the world championship were not yet done.
He advanced with 15,433 points in the balance instrument and crowned it with 15,933 points in the field exercise.
Raisman hugged him gently while waiting for his last score, and the vision that Biles once wrote on a scratch book became true, while tears appeared around the bright red, white and blue eye makeup.
Raisman's performance was like the rally of four years before he shared the fourth, but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, named “Nine” by the Americans, came ahead.
Sometimes the place where he was overcome with a suspicious return after the exercise sent a kiss to the crowd.
For the 19-year-old Biles, it can be said that the very shared tweet he posted at the beginning of this week has now got a completely new meaning:
Police: Three people were shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot in the first serial killer case in Phoenix for ten years while talking in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Officials said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on a garage road on June 12.
According to the report, the gunman stood on the passenger side of the car and shot eight hands with a gun and drove away with another vehicle.
Police say these three murders are not apparent for the purpose of the robbery because the aggressive adult victims did not get their handbags or $2,900 money.
Phoenix police spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, said the researchers were directed to investigate whether it was related to the four previous attacks.
In a four-month period, nine attacks occurred in neighborhoods where mainly Spanish people lived, killing seven people and wounding two.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, told the CBS company’s KPHO, “This happened in the settlement area in front of a house.”
It is believed that the suspect used a number of vehicles, including a black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln, in a model right to the late 1990s, a brown Nissan, and a model right to the late 1990s.
The researchers refused to explain the evidence that the attacks were related to the same killer and that the same killer did.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital due to his injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene of the incident.
A witness to the incident told the police that listening to music by sitting in a parked car was not an unusual situation.
The officials also published a police report on the shooting that targeted a vacant truck half an hour before three murders.
The researchers found the coats of the bullet, removed a bullet from a seat, and also detected the particles of the bullet in the engine division.
The mother of a 6-year-old microsphaly patient: "He gets better"
Like most six-year-old kids, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, his toys, and of course his mother.
But unlike her cousins, there is a microsphal disorder in Edmund; this is a genetic disorder that her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was not aware of her presence during pregnancy.
When I came home for the first time, my first thought was that I could not do it.
I cannot do that.
I didn’t want that.
That’s not true, and that’s what you want.”
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund could never know them or even survive.
Some doctors went ahead enough to suggest it to be deposited in the care house.
“My first reaction was to say that people don’t think I’m doing it anymore.”
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund was not able to sit straight until he was three years old, and he was still unable to speak.
But he slowly reaches some points of turning.
He can walk and ride a bicycle.
He also loves playing and singing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund has invented to say, "Please tell me to sing."
Picciuto told CBS News, “We teach him the sign language.”
But this is not the sign language as we know, it says that Edmund has invented his own sign.
Microsphaly can occur due to a series of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may be present and may be caused by infections formed by viruses such as scratch and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease can show great differences.
It is too early to tell people with Zika infection how their lives will be affected by this situation.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden the uncertainty of his future constitutes.
I always wondered what would happen.
What will be?
And he himself does not know that yet.
In fact, for a long time I didn’t ask a question about the course of the disease, since I didn’t expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto is able to give hopeful advice to the mothers of babies who are sorry for birth due to Zika.
He gets better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Louisiana has deployed rescue teams from intense rain and water strikes in Mississippi
The intense rainfall and widespread water strikes in Louisiana led the governor to declare the state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected until Saturday.
The National Weather Service that there were countless rivers in northeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, and that this pose a common danger of water pressure after intense rainflows.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said government officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and support to the districts affected by the situation is on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Government’s Office for Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation, said requests for high-water vehicles, boats and ships were made.
Steele stated that only tons of cybersecurity were requested for the Tangipahoa neighborhood.
In the southern part of Louisiana, there will be a water pressure surveillance until Saturday.
The weather services said in a statement that the area could fall an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain.
In southern Alabama, the rain continued in the Mobile area on Saturday, a water pressure surveillance was available.
Both are expected to reach record levels during the week at the Comite River near Baton Rouge in Louisiana and the Amite River near Denham Springs.
Predictor Alek Krautmann said both rivers could leave many houses underwater in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flow of water pressure in the Ascension Neighborhood is a threat because the flow of full rivers to the Lake Maurepas will be slow.
Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, was already at the highest level measured at 9 a.m. on Friday.
The rescue teams continue to rescue people from the water strikes in the Amite and Wilkinson crashes in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandson were among the rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from the Beaver Deris, usually 400 ft away from the home, was rapidly rising during the night.
A son who was sitting near him warned him.
Hansford said, “We woke up and the water continued to come.”
He came to me.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he saw in the course of 48 years he lived here.
Hansford said he and his family members were disabled and he was the only person he could swim.
Hansford said three of his emergency staff were rescued by a large, military-style truck and brought them to the fire station in Gloster where they were sheltered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as intense rain continues, the water attacks "will spread rapidly" and the authorities are considering issuing a displacement order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been saturated at a high level since Wednesday.
The authorities said the streets that were under heavy rain and water pressure had the need to rescue the residents of the Tangipahoa neighborhood and to leave schools in five school areas.
CBS’s WWL that a woman in Tangipahoa’s municipality member said 200 houses were under water pressure.
The residents were evacuated and taken to two churches but they are now under water pressure.
Neighborhood official Robby Miller said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets detained due to the rising waters.
Refugees were opened in the city of Amite and in the city of Hammond.
He said, “When the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home.”
In the town of Hammond, Tangipahoa neighborhood, two dozen streets were closed due to rising waters, and the residents were offered to take the water away from their homes and.
City administrator Lacy Landrum said, “The last major water pressure we’ve experienced was in March.”
It would be like a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said the rain continued stable on the Gulf Coast.
He said it was that there was a water pressure in several houses on Tuesday, but for Friday it has not yet been in this direction.
Keith Townson, Managing Director of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in this region for 40 years.
Townson said, “I’ve seen water in places where I’ve never seen water before,” and added, “and there’s still rain.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 year old, lived from the attack in Philadelphia
The police said the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second incident in which a six-year-old boy was shot this week.
Mahaj Brown was diagnosed with his grandmother and grandfather for CBS Philadelphia.
Her grandmother and grandfather Brown said he was injured with more than one firearm in the body, including the neck area, legs, arms and abdomen, but his consciousness was in place when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station that she had "too much suffering, her small body had a hole broken with bullets."
I cannot believe it.
The boy was listed among those who kept the child’s critical condition in the hospital and passed some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expecting healing.
He was going to start first class at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people killed in Germantown.
Two of them were killed, two of them were killed, and two of them were killed, and two of them were killed, and two of them were killed.
CBS Philadelphia said one of the 29-year-old men was in critical condition and the other two victims were in stable condition.
The station that the child was shot in the front seat of a car along with one of the 29-year-old men who were critical.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured was aggressive.
Detectives told CBS Philadelphia that several armed attackers could have shot each other.
The place of the incident was filled with bullets in the style of the attack weapon of different attack weapons.
It seems to have been a long-term conflict.
There were boats on both sides of the street and the elevator.
This also shows that there are more than one armed attacker and both are active,” Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
More than a house and car in the area were damaged.
There was no arrest and the police were investigating the security cameras.
A six-year-old girl was shot in her hand on Tuesday while playing in front of her house in West Oak neighborhood.
He is in healing process and the police are still looking for a suspect.
The reason we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This year’s Women’s Olympic Gymnastics team has this name and there are several reasons for this.
First of all, I have participated in all the Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant before.
Second: This team has three gymnastics that inspire many girls with different ethnic origins: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, joined by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, is proud to everyone.
The team finally shows a similar appearance to America.
It also strengthens the presence of women of black and Latin origin showing at the highest levels of this sport.
Over the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in rankings 1 and 2.
This is a strong thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America supported himself.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are now all three world championships, will be witnessing the extraordinary performance of their unexpected but skillful gymnastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American backward winner of the gold medal in the general women's rating.
And his teammate Aly Raisman also won the silver medal.
We are familiar with the best times of this sport, but the situation does not look like that in the gymnastique courses throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same way as Aly and Madison to get in the Olympic teams.
The reason they are "the last five" is that there will be only four gymnastics in the next Olympic gym team, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will train.
But in fact, gymnastics is a very expensive sport and gymnastics primarily work in private gymnastics clubs supported by education, travel, form, competition, hotel fees (for coaches, gymnastics and families) and many more.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can destroy these.
These clubs are the only place where gymnastics can get training and require a costly and long-term commitment to their families.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez' coach Maggie Haney have trained these athletes since they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer more affordable and affordable gymnastic training opportunities to communities.
I founded my own gymnastic foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we offered free and low-cost gymnastics training to more than 15,000 young people in the city (primarily black and Spanish) based in Harlem, and we coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (the place where I grew up) to provide quality gymnastic training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this wonderful Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and provides the characteristics of mental strict work, discipline and determination.
This combination offers long-term advantages in terms of health, school and business success.
That will guide thousands of young girls to gymnastics, this team will give inspiration and that’s a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important, especially for girls.
We are going through really exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison are grateful for bringing the gold medal as an Olympic team to "The Power of the Girls" and for motivating many young girls with different backgrounds to become a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt’s proposal was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement was reached with British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who participated in the vote voted against.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced NHS’s plans to impose sanctions on the contract, saying that “no one’s property” and that further delays will hurt staff and patients.
The first assistant group of doctors was passed to a new contract, which includes changes in work practices at night and weekends to improve care outside the normal hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA’s assistant doctors committee, said in a statement last night: “The assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially they believe that this will trigger the current labour crisis and that not all doctors are equal.”
It is only eight weeks left for the first group of doctors to be transferred to the new contract to make progress in this process, and the time is about to pass.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve the dispute by speaking were welcomed by the government’s unwillingness to interact and, in some cases, with the narrow silence.
This is a progress that is seen despite Jeremy Hunt’s statement that the moon’s door will always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must take immediate action, remove sanctions and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors.”
The assistant doctors clearly say they are prepared to increase work slowing actions if they do not.
In the last strike that took place at the end of April, 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were delayed, nurses and consultants were forced to take care of the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreement was reached with the British Medical Association officials.
BMA requires improvement in weekends payments for the contractual 54,000 assistant doctors.
NHS Employers Executive Board Managing Director Daniel Mortimer called on assistant doctors to do no strike.
Mr. Mortimer said: “Greve doesn’t solve anything but it causes anxiety, discomfort and trouble for patients, nurses and their families by creating pressure on the teams and services that are currently busy.”
Over the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other authorities, we have positively approached their concerns regarding the Supervisory Mission and the Reporting.
Employers were hoping that the continuation of positive communication on key topics - distribution, educational flexibility, additional training for those who interrupt their careers, training costs, mutual agreement on the programming, education-based leave and gender-intergender wage differences in medicine - as well as the continuation of positive communication in accordance with the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May was a sign of how seriously the employers were taken by the UK Ministry of Medical Education and Health.
Drugs that can eliminate the risk of a heart attack at £2 per day
After the authorities have suggested to be given to more people for a longer period of time, thousands of heart attacks patients will be able to benefit from the cost of £2 a day.
Ticagrelor, which prevents swelling, reduces the risk of recurring crises for people with heart disease.
The drug was given for 12 months after a heart attack and reduces the risk of a stroke or other stroke.
The NHS observer, NICE, recommended that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, suggested that it should be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year around 140,000 people in the UK suffer from a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer from another stroke or stroke.
The cause of heart crises and strokes is the accumulation of fat substances and the formation of plaque on the arterial walls.
If the plate is broken, this can cause blood clot and cause a heart attack by preventing blood from entering the heart.
And if it gets out of its place, it develops a stroke if it prevents the blood flow to the brain by moving forward in the blood flow.
People who have previously experienced a crisis are more likely to experience another crisis.
Created by the UK company AstraZeneca under the Brilique trade name, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of swelling.
The NICE guide draft, published today, recommends that individuals receive 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Managing Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "Al effective secondary preventive treatments are available, about a quarter of those with a heart attack suffer from another heart attack or stroke, and their consequences are often devastating."
Fear of rebuilding can have a pretty negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that the use of ticagrelor in conjunction with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurring heart attack and stroke in people who have previously suffered a heart attack.
With the temporary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are pleased to have increased the treatment options offered to thousands of people waiting to benefit from it.
Since more than three years of information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor is limited – primarily with the risk of bleeding – the guidelines do not recommend treatment after this period.
PC culture increased voting corruption in Muslim regions
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was resigned after government report last year due to corruption
As demonstrated by the devastating government report presented today, the political justice culture has led to the neglect of widespread voting corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles, due to "excessive sensitivity on the issue of ethnic origin and religion" due to the negligence of evidence of election abuse, the police, election observers and the municipal palace were shaken.
The former community secretary and today’s anti-corruption regime said that the digestion of voters for religious reasons is so bad that the police should be allowed to pull out the voting cabins to protect the scared voters.
He suggested that voters keep their identity with them to prove their identity when they voted.
In the present case, it is enough to say the name and address of the choice.
The report even suggests that a permanent ink should be thrown on the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said the people in the report should be protected better.
He called for better access to the Board of Directors and decisions of non-formal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to provide protection against fraud in elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and financial fraud that is handled by it," he said.
The report was prepared on the instructions of Downing Street after the Tower Hamlets’ voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided to withdraw mayor Lutfur Rahman after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "insultly abused the religious feelings of the Muslim community" and silenced those who criticized him with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
“Rahman’s campaign is based on the basis that the Muslims who believe in him vote for him is a religious task.”
Up to 300 games were suspicious or the result of false identity use, i.e. voting as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence that fraud was done throughout the country.
He, in particular, warned of corruption in voting by mail - where it was claimed that the Muslim community’s elderly individuals were pushing to vote for the island they chose.
Sir Eric made some recommendations for the arrangement of the voting system, including having their identity with them to prove who they are.
The report contained the following statements: "Some ethnic minority communities have obtained evidence that they are under pressure on valuable individuals, primarily women and young people, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh, to be voted according to the will of the elderly.
“There were concerns that government institutions are ignoring such behaviors due to ‘political truth’ based on excessive sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for the system, including the prohibition of the processing of post and voting documents by political activists for the purpose of "collecting the balls".
The report, which was reviewed by Theresa May, also calls on to strengthen registration controls to prevent the use of the electoral mass for immigration and social aid corruption purposes.
The choice of voters to demonstrate their identity before voting should be considered.
After voting to prevent any person from voting twice, a permanent ink is applied to the person's fingers.
systematic controls of the person's conformity to determine the right to vote.
A three-year limit is applied to applications for the use of automatic mail voting.
The prohibition of political campaign officials and activists to process the votes sent by completed mail and the cover of the votes sent by mail.
Police are given the authority to pull stripes around the voting cabins.
Amendments to the Law on People's Representation of 1983 to facilitate the accusation of terrorism.
It is illegal to take photos in the voting cabins.
In the voting cabins (except Wales) it is required to speak English only.
Strengthening the training that the staff receives on the sanction of the rule of entering the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric cruelly criticized the police, saying it was "interesting" that no accusations were made in the Tower Hamlets case.
“The election court has decided that there is no place to accuse Lutfur Rahman and his representative of repeated corruption and illegal activities,” he said.
With a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable suspicions – according to the nature of the criminal proof.
He also criticized the uneffective "cock marking controls" in the municipal palace's election registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Tower Hamlets’s last year’s court ruling was a warning alarm.
Although our nation is proud to make the mother of parliaments, the spread of this worrying and secret election corruption and its rejection by some institutions can lead to the degradation of this good reputation.
Be crazy for Kate's cyclist and other famous similarities of Rio Olympics
This week, Rio 2016 Olympics enthusiasts turned crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved it looks impressively like the Cambridge Falls.
However, the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete that attracts attention with similarity to celebrity while fighting for the gold medal this summer; at least the social media thinks so.
Therefore, in honor of all the famous symbols we have seen on the Rio Games and our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes that look beyond liking them to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. Men's Armoring Team member Brady Ellison (left), compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to the similarity of Kate on the bicycle track, many people in the online environment showed that a shooter could look like a twin to Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Armoring Team, shook on Twitter after the photos showing her similarity to the movie Star of the Money Hunter were revealed.
And the gunman also acknowledged this madness on social media and acknowledged that he was told that he was like Leo since his childhood.
Brady told Huffington Post, “I don’t think there’s much similarity except hair and hair.”
“He’s a beautiful man, so I think it’s a compliment.”
There is another similarity, which is one of the most popular comparisons of London 2012 and will undoubtedly draw more attention this year: the incredible similarity of the British long jumping athlete Greg Rutherford to the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with his great and meaningful eyes, and the American artist Gloria Estefan of Cuban origin, were said to be similar to each other.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been similar to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user claims that Nathan's Start movie star is a 'athletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared to each other for a long time due to the similarity of their heads and lips.
The Russian team's silver medal swimmer has the same bronze skin and yellow hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while his fans say that Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team looks like "Joseph Gorgon Levitt's athletic version".
Hard women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face shape and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user was very pleased that other people noticed this similarity
A theory remaining in the air: This user thinks that there may be a reason behind this couple being in a similar appearance
A Twitter user said he was happy to hear that "the rest of the internet is thinking that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are like twins."
In fact, the American football star and the actress playing in Dexter have similar faces and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost the same smile with another gold medal gymnast Gabby Douglas and the big smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of Youth Fire.
CBC Olympic spokesman apologizes for the Chinese swimmer's comment on 'he died like a pig'
The analysis of Byron MacDonald's 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth in the 4x200 m free race, CBC's Wednesday's live Olympics broadcast was very angry.
The Canadian broadcasting agency CBC has forced one of its spokesmen to apologize for the comments that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "destroyed as a bad smell" and "dead as a pig" in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought the microphone was closed when women began to explain their ideas in the 4x200m free flag race final.
It was heard that MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's spiker team to add 'color', spoke: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese was a heavy bag, my baby.'
He was too exciting, he was removed like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14), ending the second foot of the flag race at 1:57.79 time, made the Canadian Taylor Rack 1.61 seconds behind, allowing the Canadians to close the difference between China and China.
Canadian spectators moved rapidly after being surprised by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane "CBC spokesman just said that the 14-year-old swimmer 'was dead like a pig'???
The backwoman was not aware that he was still in the broadcast."
Chinese Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race was defined as follows: 'The 14-year-old little Chinese was a heavy bag, my baby.'
The criticism of Byron MacDonald was posted on Twitter quite hard and quickly, and many were qualified to report himself.
Twitter users were unable to keep themselves when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was behaving
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: 'Well #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and you make us all look racist.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who continued the CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment with the following words: "We apologize for the commented on the swimming race."
These were really unfortunate words, we’re sorry that such a thing happened.”
CBC has been forced to apologize at least 90 times more than those who tweeted in response to the comment.
Another speaker, Scott Russel, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC later copied and attached this apology to more than 90 Twitter users who sent their complaints about MacDonald’s comments.
The network quickly issued an apology.
We want to express our sincere regrets for the fact that these statements have been presented and published.
Last night, we apologized quickly to our followers in the broadcast, our viewers, and our social media followers.
We want to explain that Byron’s comments were not related to the swimmer’s personality, but to his performance.
However, these were quite inappropriate and unfortunately selected words, and Byron was extremely sad of what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald also apologized and tried to defend his statements, saying he did not want to make a personal attack.
She told CBC's Olympic broadcast, "I want to apologize for a comment I made after the women's flag race yesterday night."
“I was referring not to the character of the swimmer, but to his performance.”
“I don’t want to say too much, I don’t want to be disrespectful and I’m very sorry.”
The customer of Primark was angry with the woman who desperately tried underwear in the center of the store.
Customers didn’t know what to do when a woman pulled out their clothes to try a cylinder in the middle of the Primark store.
Even worse, the woman looked at how it looked in herself, pulled it out, and put it back on.
He continued to look and then tried four pairs of indoor clothes at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The place where the woman was trying to wrap before it was the Primark store located in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
At that time, the mother of two children in the store, Jenny Davidson, said after trying the mysterious woman's clothes, she was "reweared and left the store without getting anything."
He said, “People could not believe in their eyes.”
He stood in the middle of the store and took a coat from the showroom, pulled out his coat socks and pants and dressed on it.
“He did not try to look for a special place to do this, he stood out with all his dishonesty.”
"When he pulled out the coat, everyone looked at him and it seemed that he didn't like the coat because he put the coat again."
He tried three more clothes until he decided he didn’t like anything, and then went out of the store and dressed again.
“The people who watched him seemed not to care, and they didn’t think of the one who would buy the bulbs he tried on later.”
Mrs. Davidson, 33 years old, who lives in the town of Kent, said, “How angry it is to think that someone will take and go home with an unclean coat that someone else wears.”
This occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: “I think that the staff found the clothes out of sale after it came out, and that’s a good thing.”
“When I get a new shirt and go home, it would be really bad to think that someone else was wearing the shirt and that it came to me without washing.”
A Primark spokesman said, “Primark is aware of the incident in our shop in Folkestone on Tuesday 9th August.”
The product is removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from armed attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video offered by Dailymail.com can help you be safer.
We met Rhon Mizrachi, the chief master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to learn how to deal with armed thieves nearby.
Whether it approaches you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how you can turn the situation against the thief.
Mizrachi says when he approaches you from the back, the first thing you have to do is to turn your face and see the aggressor and 'discover the fire line'.
Then you will hold the gun between your front arm and your shoulder and hit your face with your empty back.
Then, when you’re kneeling on your knives, the pain of the attacker will double, and at this stage you’ll turn the weapon and take it out of your hand, and the weapon will turn to him, and you’ll shoot his face so that the back of the weapon will remain on top.
When the armed person approaches from the front, a similar technique is applied; by pulling your body out of the fire line, you capture the weapon and turn it in a way that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, by giving your weight to the weapon, you turn the weapon and take it from it by shooting the attacker from the chest area and retreat the weapon by directing it.
Does it sound unhearted?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi does it.
But remember; if you’re not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid any theft will be to give your money to the thief.
Traveller Ian Wright took his language to the dirty places in Europe for a travel guide
The British traveler passed a serious test of the immune system and the reflection of the wrath, throwing some of the dirty and ugly places in Europe.
The server and travel writer, Suffolklu Ian Wright (51), sparked his tongue on a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Cirky crawler, a train toilet siphon button, and an anchored phone in Russia to prove the strength of the immune system.
He used a luminometer to show him and us what kind of work he was transmitted before he sparked each object.
But the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which was to be converted into a film, gave some surprising results.
Although the idea of throwing the siphon button in a trend used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, in fact there are much more evil bacteria in the kitchen laundry.
Mr Wright talked with doctors and medical experts on the increase in stomach bacteria and health during his trip to Europe.
Fortunately, nothing he laid had an effect except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test his stomach resistance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task in a wide range, from the general cracks at the train stations to the toilet siphon buttons, has definitely tested the immune system.
In the film, he said, “Since my childhood I’ve not been a very careful person for my health, and I’ve put in my mouth a lot of things, from soil, to worms, and to steam water.”
During the film, he clearly demonstrated the cause of his fame.
The only thing he denied was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The image sample showed the number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
If compared, this number should be below 60 in the newly washed hands.
But in the newly washed hands it became a Russian public toilet where it refused to swallow when the luminometer number exceeds 4000 units while below 60
Mr Wright and the Finnish dairy producer, Valio, took over the production of the travel film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
He said in the film, “It’s about to be one of the worst things I’ve smelled in a toilet.”
There is nothing more ugly than that!
I’m not going to do anything because it’s disgusting.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D that help to strengthen the stomach bacteria and immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Senior Vice President of Valio’s Breakfast, Fruit Water and New Categories, said: “We wanted to offer something really new to consumers.
This is something that is impressive and will also explain the benefits of probiotics.
Finally, we made many crazy brain storms where the idea of "Let's call Ian" emerged.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put the products in a much larger bond; the importance of good and bad bacteria around us daily, the health of the stomach and its connection to the immune system.
Interest in stomach health becomes a global phenomenon and with this documentary we could give consumers more interesting information about this situation.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “I’m going to say that if Ian had some things that I wanted him to blame like the ugly Russian toilet shown in the film, I’d lose my respect for him.”
Of course, though it was easy for Ian to throw some things, some were quite difficult.
I am happy that we have recorded some of these dirty acts."
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of participants associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 percent said they used products containing lactic acid bacteria at least periodically.
The Maganda family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall social housing before evacuation
A Moga family damaged £50,000 in the social housing they were evacuated because they scared their neighbors.
After many complaints on the rights of Tanya Skeldon and his wife Shaun Trebilcock, Saltash was thrown out of the housing in Cornwall.
When they were forcibly removed from the property, the residential association officials were surprised to see the property was unreparable.
There were large holes in the walls, the plaque tables were dismantled, the waste was thrown into the places and the walls were written with walls.
The family is now removed from the housing and they are believed to benefit from private accommodation options
Cornwall Housing housing manager Donna McEvoy said she was afraid the situation could not be rescued.
He said, “I think this is really a nightmare for people here and people should not have to live this way.
There is a lot to join the account because this property will now be known as a very unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation and its names have a bad reputation.
The family had three sons living in the interim property and, according to the police, the family had adopted many scary behaviors, including struggling with the baseball hole in the street, scaring the nearby inhabitants, drug use, drug sale, and excessive crying, debate and disbelief.
In June, an anti-social behavior decision was made for Skeldon (47), named under the Kira contract.
A lot of old waste was found in many rooms of the house.
In the past, the drug-selling property was removed.
Neighbors said they saw them struggle in the street and the police were often searched for.
Cornwall Housing has forced him and his wife to leave the property this week after recognizing the 11 weeks period being extended for voluntarily moving.
The evacuation process was welcomed by relaxed neighbors who said their lives were back into a nightmare.
One man said, “No one was worried about them.”
We have been with them for 20 years and the situation has always been bad.
If you say how many times we’ve seen the police here, you can’t believe it.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We woke up because the average was so quiet; we are not used to it!
Finally they went away, now everything will be great.
Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood sanctions officer Adam Fitzpatrick said the family did not cooperate with the local administration.
The family lived in this house for 20 years and the property was often called to the police.
It was thrown to the side of the social house covered with plants and old toys.
He added: “It’s really shameful that the tenant doesn’t take any responsibility for the evacuation of himself and his family; the evacuation has always been the last option that Cornwall Housing applied for.
This was a very challenging case because the behaviors were excessive and the actions were scary at the level that the neighbors should not witness.
I appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces and the courageous community members to inform us.
I hope that this development will be understood as a message that it will provide some relief to the neighbors and that anti-social behaviors will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons living in the property at different times but they were 20 years old.
A dirty bed left on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after evacuation
Housing workers will need to clean the waste amounts surrounding the house
In 2014, the police found more than 70 grams of spiders, patterns, private items and £1700 cash by pressing the property.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after acknowledging his crime of possession of class B drugs with the intention of selling.
He claimed that the money would be used to buy a grave stone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being homeless, it became clear that Tanya and her wife now stay in a private housing in Plymouth.
Most of the houses had walls on the walls.
The police said they will work towards the evacuation of renters who violate the rental rules.
Angela Crow, from the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, said the evacuation was a warning for other renters who continued to violate the rules.
He said, "This is a message for those who think that they will be able to act as they want without any accusation and that their behavior will be lost."
The Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, which will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and anti-social behavior.
After a military plane passed the beach, tourists in Portugal were scared.
Tourists sunnying in Aveiro, Portugal, have suffered a shock in their lives
The Portuguese Air Force launched the P-3C Orion aircraft from the very low.
The air force said it was an training flight but insisted that there was no security risk.
This is the moment when the flying jet passes through the full beach when tourists begin to panic.
In the dramatic images, there is a military airplane that approaches almost at the contact level of the sunrise on the sand in Aveiro, north of Portugal.
Travellers stood up because they were clearly concerned about the noise created by the jet engines without seeing what was going to them from the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few travellers who shared the video of the dramatic near flight on social media, said: "Two times it really passed down and it seemed to be about to hit at a point."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me."
In Aveiro, tourists on the beach were scared when the flight from the dark began to fly at an extremely low figure.
The Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats on the coast and that it was the only way to control them, and that it had to go so down.
The air force said the jet was flying lower than usual because the smoke from the power fire was weak in visibility, but the air force insisted that no one’s safety was threatened.
This summer, extinction power fires destroyed certain parts of the main land of Portugal and caused the deaths of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot should fly from the bottom due to the conditions that make it difficult to see (intensive dirt and smoke caused by power fires)
The aircraft was on training flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels as part of the exercise.
London student killed in Syria
One of the three British girls who left London to join ISIS last year, Kadiza Sultana, was to have died in Syria.
Advocate Tasnime Akunjee said his family had received information about the death of Rakka in Syria a few weeks ago.
According to ITV News on Thursday, it is believed that he was killed in a Russian air strike in the region of Rakka, where the group was strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and died while planning to escape the country that, according to her family, was damaged by the war and return to Britain.
Akunjee "We hope that this situation will emphasize that going to war zones as a grave stone and a testament for others is really dangerous and that people will break the courage to make this choice."
In February 2015, two girls from Sultan and East London were on a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told to be married to a ISIS fighter in Syria and being widow for months.
Reid says he will not give up Garland as a high court candidate if Clinton is elected
The Senate's Democratic leader Harry Reid said the Democrats believed that he would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court if the president candidate Hillary Clinton was elected.
Republicans in the Senate have been blocking the approval process of Garland since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate's majority leader Mitch McConnell said the new president would choose the person to replace former Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a video speech on Thursday that he believed Clinton would choose Garland and that "there are reasons for it."
Later, a spokesman on behalf of Reid said he didn’t talk directly with Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and was in speculation.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team didn't want to "destroy the current situation" by making a new election.
Garland is the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeal in Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who prevented Garland from being nominated were the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s “assisters” and “repressors”.
Trump said he was not suitable for his mission.
Treats stated that 'for men as well as for women' is on the side of a naked calendar
The magazine Treats works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s’s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of famous and naked people, they are trying to find the new generation of ball models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw said that this magazine, which has a high naked rate at the beginning of this year, is different from the former Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
It is clear that he believes that the calendar is the same.
Shaw said in a press release about the calendar, “As men, we need to go back to showing the classic nakedness that is not fashionable, so that women can easily see these images of the female body as a source of inspiration.”
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can send photos online or participate in open conversations in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl Target: Who Are the Purchasers Really?
The middle-aged, lonely men love vinyl.
Let us say that this statement is based on real data before we go to the comment section to find amazing insults under the no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
According to YouGov, the return of the plays, which are a much mentioned topic, is not a result of the Y generation seeking the innovation created by a physical object, but of the mid-age nostalgia.
Recently, those who buy vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the lowest chance.
This is also not only caused by the curious acts; they have an emotional importance; older vinyl recipients are often those who love to hide their feelings (56 and 53 percent) and those who enjoy being alone (69 and 66 percent).
Are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog was a news posted on television, the camera would watch it walking in a crowded street of Soho, with a modest gray dress, showing many gestures before it stopped, and after it united and opened my hands, saying something such as: "So let's take a look."
So let’s take a look.
While Soho's center gradually loses its magic and unusual atmosphere (the buildings where once independent sellers were now filled with hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases), there are still several specialized plate stores.
I’d probably want him to stop from the camera for the next part; I’d try to get information about his age and his emotional condition through observation by standing close to the different men in some of these stores.
From Sister Ray (data counting: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data counting: eight middle-aged men, probably a 20-year-old woman), the Glasgow Stuart (55) spends the afternoon in London for a meeting and browses the stores to fill a few free hours.
I ask if you are a collector.
“I think I’m so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates on the picture above (the official sent me by e-mail, I didn’t follow him to his home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason for such numerous albums and singles being collected is partly the result of their profitable revenues; now, when they first come out, they can get the discs that they don’t have enough money, and they can buy back what they sold in their youth and unmatched times.
“Most of the things I’ve got at the end of the 60s in the early 70s, the things I’ve got when I was 11 or 12 years old; I’ve been too young to get.”
It agrees with the idea that the buyers are likely to be people who love to stay alone, and adds: "I don't smoke, I don't drink too much alcohol.
This is my evil.
Wez, who works at Sister Ray, (25) believes that most of the customers he encountered followed the YouGov profile.
But he realized that a new wave was created affected by overwhelming advertisements in the media, and that those who heard that this fashion came back need to buy back the old plates.
In the conversations I made, I realized that people were usually removed from their collections in 1998 or 1999.
“Clients who first sold their vinyls to buy CDs now sell their CDs to get back the discs.”
This can explain the increase in people of a certain age who resurrect the vinyl.
What about the emotional importance of the plays?
It takes you a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, plakat stores offer a comfortable community of people with similar personality.
According to Wez, some elderly big customers, especially untouched, have been powered by the payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to shelter to the stability of the well-known plate cover, which reminds from the digital world and recalls the quiet youth memories.
Wez says, “Sometimes this may be because of filling a vacuum or seeing material items as a kind of comfort.”
Because I am a collector, I think that’s a lot of people.
This is a simple way to fill your mind.
A colleague throwing out of a plate says, “We are like social service officials.”
A survey in April revealed that 50 percent of the vinyl albums received last month did not yet listen to the album.
The survey also revealed that 41% were a pickup that they never used, and 7% bought vinyl while they didn’t have plaque spots.
At this stage of the news, I’d probably showed a very worrying appearance while examining a series of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" direction of this return is also an element noticed by Jonny (42) who works in Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-age men).
Soon one came to me and said, "I don't have a plate player but I want to get a Radiohead plate to put it on our roof."
Although this does not represent a large percentage, it definitely reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
Some people say, “I don’t have a playoff.”
These are not the elderly, but the young people, who are at the end of the twentieth, who are newly entering this topic.
Now, when I get to Fopp, which has almost all separated for vinyl, I see that the audience is quite varied.
At the age of 70 there are couples, photographers, young boys and middle-aged women.
The atmosphere is less cool than the above-mentioned stores (the last part of the Wild Beast) and the speakers are spreading sex-containing pop instead of calming jazz, but it is good to see diversity among customers.
None of them don’t seem alone, but it’s hard to solve the psychological trauma that disturbs them by staying next to one for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), has been surfing in Fopp for a few minutes and browsing the discount plates.
Instead of spending, he went out to look at the exhibitions.
He says he has no choice to make a plate collection because he doesn’t win too much.
very expensive.
It’s easier to listen to music from the computer or otherwise, but the beauty of the vinyl...”
I don't know how to explain it, it's not really the same.
My last stop is a said store that inspired the new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
I observe a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before the discussion of a father and daughter’s purchase of a Crosley plate player as though they’re looking out the pants.
On the left there is a staircase full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac; plates that are not for an average collection; a mixture of modern and classical.
No one looks; because they are just for decoration purposes, some are too high to not be touched.
This is an artistic vinyl.
But the curiosity about these items may mean that the industry will make more money and send less customers to the depths of Soho; there is no much to complain about.
It is not surprising that a demographic group that has more money and time than most is spending more money on more luxury items like vinyl.
But my findings show that the results of YouGov are at least true in Soho plakat stores; the numbers are too many, in reality, women collectors and vinyl enthusiasts found in plakat stores or online forums don’t take into account.
These people are probably working quite hard at school or in the offices.
These people definitely don’t spend their Thursday evening traveling in the plakat shops in Berwick Street, looking at the plakates and escaping from the sights of a 30-year-old fake TV server looking over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don’t know anything.
Greenland Shark, the Longest Living Spinal Beast in the World - Video News
Scientists have revealed that the Greenland dogs have the longest life among the spine on the planet.
According to Julius Nielsen, the record belongs to a five-meter long, 272 to 512-year-old dog.
French court rejects proposal to destroy shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the proposal by Calais officials to destroy dozens of crossing stores and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In this week’s court trial, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw straw.
Calais Governorate argued that these places should be destroyed because they created a non-taxed parallel economy and they are at risk in terms of fire and hygiene.
Adjustable groups told the court that stores and restaurants are vital, and the free food offered by government-backed organizations and other groups is not sufficient for the growing population in the camp.
They claimed that shrinking stores and restaurants often provide accommodation and free food for those in need.
A court in Lille stated that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of the people who operated the 72 stores crash store, but the Calais Valley's concerns were also "comprehensible".
Judge Jean-François Molla stated that bakes, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than just eating people living in “extremely dangerous conditions.”
These areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
The Jungle Children’s Book Cafe, one of the places at risk of collapse, offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and here, hundreds of unrested refugees in the camp are advised about refuge.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect this cafe for children.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closing process said it would be a facia for "some of these children who are over eight years old."
The two charity bodies, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the population in the Jungle camp would rise over 9,000 (the highest number to date) after the number of arrivals increased during the summer period.
After the gold in the Fiji mastery class, Britain got the silver medal in the seventh rugby championship.
Britain's impressive progress in the Rugby 7 Championship ended after 43-7 defeats at the Rio Deodoro Stadium in the final with Fiji on Thursday.
Fiji gave a mastery lesson in conception, pass, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to win the first Olympic medal of every color.
After the defeat, Britain won the third silver medal of the day as a not so bad comfort award and can now be proud of their efforts in the opening tournament of the Olympics 7, which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African team, which they defeated by 7-5 in the semi-final, may have found them in the final.
However, a Fiji in such a form could even defeat a team of 15 people.
Although it’s not very incredible, the UK can find comfort by thinking that at least one British will wear the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s chief coach, Ben Ryan, is a British from Wimbledon.
This was a very difficult journey for Britain.
Eight times before, when they worked with Ryan, they had lost every match in the Seven Championships in Adelaide.
This time, they lost only one.
Although this is painful, the progress shown is truly disappointing.
Fiji made a fascinating start, the players passed through the attempts of Britain to get the ball.
This seemed to be running between a series of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, and the World Series champions passed 5-0 ahead when they moved from the corner of Osea Colinisao.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another false number from the right wing.
The match was 12-0 and Britain had almost no more to touch the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing third as the mountain, but this was only to delay the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner and Britain fell 17-0 back.
While it was only a minute to finish the first half, Nakarawa made another number from the beginning.
Later, Vatemo Ravouvou flew to the line for numbers by passing through some challenging British interventions.
With this number, the score between the circuit reached 29-0.
While a team set up to play in the Fiji 7 championship, it seemed that the UK was still trying to learn the foundations of the business.
This is the way down up.
Great Britain made great changes between the circuit and closed the Fiji barrier; for exactly four minutes that was a good progress compared to the first half until Josua Tuisova came to the stage with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton found it in a trial for Great Britain and tried to make numbers from the left corner to score 36-7, but the game fans were in the hands of the South Sea Islands who sing, flags and danced.
It was really difficult not to admire Fiji’s happy approach from the beginning to the end.
Maa Viliame also worshipped the last additions to the Fiji game that doesn’t need to be decorated in the last minutes.
When the dude was stolen, the Fijians began to celebrate, and the Great Britain took the way to the dressing room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-final, and Britain also faced South Africa in a challenging semi-final match; Britain advanced with a single number.
Kyle Brown had advanced the South African team in the first half, but Dan Norton had advanced the numbers he received in the second half with his head-to-head foot movements.
With the great intervention of Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who was in the top 15 of England, the victory and the silver medal were guaranteed.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by their coach’s fight against cancer.
There will be no more emotional gold medal in these games, and that has an important meaning.
After 220 punitive breaths from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they earned gold in Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two men who pulled the balls, there were three sounds on the boat; the women were the first women to reach this level this year in the UK in the process of moving back and back to the second gold Olympic medal their coach Robin Williams' voice was also highlighted on the boat.
Their judgments were quite clear; this was their unprecedented, unbeatable, 39th race of the unbeatable series.
If we see two great athletes flushing on the surface in the grain, this image does not fully reflect the nature of the victory.
Behind each bull gold medal, there is an arrow of willing hands that provide increased gains that make this difference, and no hand was as effective as the coaches who didn’t know if they would live enough to see that day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and went.
I was caught with a type of cervical cancer that could be interfered with surgery and they did it.
If they don’t, they go everywhere.
It would be a pretty bad situation.
This changes your view of life a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
He was very lucky because he could start treatment outside of the season, at the beginning of 2014, it is unknown whether it would be a correct expression in such cases but in this way he will be able to minimize the distortion of attention.
I had to pay, so I had to recover quickly.
This was an encouragement for me.
I was in the hospital and even though they said it was enough to take a few steps, I was walking up to 6, 9, 15 meters in the garden.
Started in this way.
It’s a journey to pull the bull on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After victory, he was in Williams, who spent a stressful morning talking a little more than usual to overcome his own concerns.
Stanning, a captain of the Royal Shooter Union and who has previously visited Afghanistan, said, “I was emotionally destroyed this week, maybe that’s a bit overwhelming but seriously meaningful.”
This once again emphasizes what this means for me and how much Helen, I and Robin worked.
I spent a wonderful three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would not, so I want to express my greatest thanks to him for being the best coach in the world.
I could not find a better person or a better coach to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the race for five years.
The two holds a hard rhythm that their competitors cannot reach.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark closed the gap, Stanning and Glover's power has not yet exhausted.
We made ourselves the main.
Helen was calling “See the process, see the process.”
It is really important not to go.
We had a good start and did not try to do anything incredible.
Today we didn’t expect the firefighters to explode, we just wanted to win the race we got out with a good crawl and we did that.
The two will take a break for a year before they decide what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month; the wedding of himself and television adventurer Steve Backshall.
I just want to enjoy this moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
This would make a lot of pressure.
It took me six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressful.
Here, it lasted about four minutes.
It’s a much better feeling.”

Bulgaria announces inflation values for the first time in 8 months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation in Bulgaria in June was at a level of 1%.
This is the highest value seen for years (since June 2012), but the first value seen above zero since October after the positive value of 0.2 per cent last year.
The average annual inflation measured by CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, meaning the monthly inflation was at the level of 1,0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate difference (compared between July 2016 and December 2015) was 0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was 0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices increased in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7 %), transportation (1.8 %), entertainment and culture (6.3 %), restaurants and hotels (1.2 %), various goods and services (0.3 %).
The prices of clothes and shoes (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine care (0.5%) and health care (0.1%) fell.
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices remain at the same level in communication and training groups.
Snapchat's "anime" effect has been criticized as an Asian cartoon
While Snapchat says it is inspired by animations for this filter, some observers say it is racist.
Snapchat allows about 150 million users to play with their identities at an absurd level by changing reality every day.
You can turn yourself into an ananas, a dog, or a character thrown from a Roy Lichtenstein picture.
Mercury is an untouchable, character-changing vehicle that creates more than 30 million enhanced gravity each day.
The wrong steps are quickly grabbed into the memory of the public.
Snapchat fans have been accused in the past that the app supports black classification or that it offers whiteed skin tones as a beauty ideal.
Therefore, because of the lens they offer this week, which makes users with attractive eyes, broken teeth and swollen sides, some critics criticized the company that it was a "Asian mask" that caricated the Asian people.
And they wondered whether these repeated disputes indicate a greater problem with the company’s diversity.
News and anger spread on Wednesday with the news from The Verge and Motherboard and announced a day later that Snapchat had deleted the feature.
The company found in a statement: Mercek was prepared not to be cartooned by the Asian, but by honour of anime characters.
But for the observers who have experienced racism, this pattern reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Other people generally refused to compare the anime.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American student of art and tweeted a lot about the photos, said in an email that the shell was "in the lightest way painful and annoying."
"He added that the discussion is difficult when it comes to comparing the effects of the filter side by side with the bad Asian cartoon.
This also shows that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also an Asian mask at a humiliating level.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses cultural trigger mechanisms.
The American culture seems to be in an endless conflict on diversity and inclination in many areas, from the meeting rooms of the institutions to Hollywood and the devices we all have in our hands.
And what Snapchat addresses, the widespread youth crowd, which has more racial diversity than other opponents, can also be interpreted as they may be in a higher sensitivity expectation.
In an interview on Thursday, the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's patches created a small degrading image for a user, "this movements are much harder to not be noticed as before."
On Thursday, Mrs. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete Snapchat account and called everyone in this direction.
In his article for Medium and a telephone interview, he said he believed that racist conflicts reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s hiring applications.
Mrs. Zhu ended her article with a tag by criticizing the company’s leading team consisting of most white men: #SnapchatiSilin.
Mrs. Zhu, a Chinese American, said, “Of because the different races are not in sufficient diversity among their staff, they can make such decisions, or even if there are people who work and belong to different races, they don’t feel safe or comfortable enough to talk to themselves.”
Other observers also share their views on the complaint that Snapchat has largely left unresponsive.
The company does not share figures related to the diversity between its employees by emphasizing the state of the private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company recently joined a recruitment manager with a view to focusing on unrepresented populations and increasing their involvement work internally.
Mrs. Zhu, from its point of view, said that she will keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to say that’s not true.”
Congress panel says military officials destroyed ISIS intelligence
In a Thursday-published report, a congress panel that U.S. Central Command officials destroyed their intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the events on the ground about the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
A interim report prepared by the Palace's Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee of Defence Payment, a working team composed of the President of the Republican Council, found that there was "a common dissatisfaction" among the Central Command intelligence analysts who said the U.S. Supreme Forces had changed the Islamic State's assessments.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla. and controls the U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
According to the report, “the intelligence outcomes approved by senior Centcom leaders typically draw a more positive picture than the facts in the field of U.S. terror prevention efforts, and constantly provide much more positive results than the analysis made by other members of the intelligence community.”
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert said, “What is happening in Centcom is unacceptable; our troops are in trouble while bad analysis is presented to the high-level decision makers.”
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the top levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also provides details of the permanent issues in 2014 and 2015, which are included in the Central Command’s description and analysis of the U.S. training efforts to the Iraqi forces.
Although there is no clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered to amend the reports, analysts have felt pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the threat created by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many Central Command newspapers, statements and congress statements were significantly more positive than real events.”
For example, a Centcom official openly stated that a major military attack on the recovery of Mosul could be carried out early in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
The Republican representative of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement, “After months of research, this issue was quite clearly understood.”
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the senior intelligence leaders of the U.S. Central Command have manipulated the intelligence results of the commander in Iraq to launch the threat of ISIS as irrelevant.
After the Republicans learned that analysts expressed their concerns about the manipulation of the intelligence about the Islamic State, they created a work hand.
As the reviews continue, the report published on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
Another Centcom intelligence investigation is also available, which is being carried out by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
The Democratic Members of the Palace Intelligence Committee also published their own findings on Thursday participating in some of the findings that the Republican working hand reached.
Democratic Chairman Adam B. Schiff said in a statement, “Thro 2014 and 2015, the Centcom, ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces had a very narrow process of intelligence assessment.”
According to Mr. Schiff, this process “retarded the publication of intelligence outcomes”, led to a moral disorder among analysts and “not given enough room for opposite opinions.”
But Mr. Schiff and Democrats said they did not find a conclusion that the White House’s Centcom analysts were pushing the results to “pre-defined or political narrative”.
The preliminary results of the Congress review were announced on Tuesday by Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times that a general review of the Pentagon inspector was opened after the complaints made by Centcom analysts.
Chief Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that he would not comment on the Congress report by the Ministry of Defense during the process of the general inspector’s investigation.
However, he said that “experts may be in dispute about the interpretation of complex data in some cases and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues.”
The investigation will raise emphasis beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is ongoing (this is a claim that is raised by more and more Defense officials every day).
But last year’s accusations have raised the question of how much President Obama could trust the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticism of the reflection of the Islamic State intelligence began when the Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which the administration of President George W. Bush, despite the many analysts, defended a small force in Iraq and stated that he did not consider enough after the 2003 occupation and has been discussed for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the rebellion on Islamic State intelligence.
The officials said Mr. Hooker's team, despite the public statements in the opposite direction last year, the air attacks against the refiners that the Islamic State has in possession have built temporary refiners to sell oil in the carabors and have concluded that the terrorist group has not affected the financial resources significantly.
But, as the Times in September, this finding was not out of the Central Command.
Centcom's then commander General Lloyd J. Austin III last year was criticized because his statement in the Senate was seen by many lawmakers as an extremely positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and took his place to the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. Women's Hockey Team, preparing to meet with Britain, won the 4th victory backward.
A day after Katie Bam scored three goals in her 6-1 victory against Japan, the first two goals of the U.S. women's grass hockey team were scored on Thursday in the match where the Americans defeated India 3-0.
While five goals in two matches seem to require a permanent skill in mind, Bam (27), said he was not sure if he did the same before.
He said, “I have no idea.”
I am not one of those who keep their records.
It is known that the Americans share the first place in the group with Britain, which continues their way as a match after 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and Thursday 2-0 defeat against Japan.
The United States and Britain will meet on Saturday for the first round final game.
Both teams are entitled to the quarter-finals and the match will determine who will finish the six-team group matches first and who will finish the second.
The team that finishes the group matches first will not meet the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of another group when the quarterfinals begin, for a little longer.
But after Saturday's match, the Americans created sensation by showing a surprising progress here after the last of the 12 teams they arrived at the London Olympics.
I was in this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa; he was 3 years old when he first took the grass hockey cup in his hand (those two sisters were interested in this sport in Drexel) and at 16 years old he became the youngest player of the team by joining the national team.
He lost the 2008 Olympics because he failed to enter the final team.
Then came the 2012 year where most things didn’t go well for him and his team members.
The following year, a British coach Craig Parnham was brought to office and things began to change.
Bam says “A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change.”
We are no longer working like in London.
We went through my full conversion.
On Thursday night, Bam got the first number of tomorrow with a closely reverse blow.
India had not yet won in the tournament, but the team was able to retain the score by 1-0 until the third quarter in which Bam entered.
He made a long run with the ball from the left of the square and then turned the ball to the castle and threw the Americans 2-0 ahead.
Melissa Gonzales scored the final goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match in which the U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who allowed one goal in the first three victories, did not eat a goal in the tournament.
The chance opened.
The same goes for Bam.
Parnham said "We're in a good place right now," but it depends on how good this place was on Saturday's match.
The Olympic Ambition of Trambolin
No matter where you are, the Olympics will continue.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work and as if it would never end or avoid.
The Olympic square itself is like a flame baton that is transmitted from the swimmer to the gymnast from there to the triathlonist.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos can’t watch television without hearing anything about the dispute, you can’t read the newspapers, or you can’t listen to what your neighbor says in a cafe.
There is also Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who took part in the Olympics for the first time, among the sponsorships and TV ads that encourage you to feel good, can be one of the names shown in the prime time hours with a gamzelled heartbeat like a swimmer, a gymnast or a scratcher.
But Lake Forest from California, Mr. Dooley (28) is struggling for the golden medal at the Olympics.
The Olympic flame does not light every event at the same level.
Far from the center, there are some of the sports that are not universally recognized in the shadow: hot gun shooting, shooting, badminton, tekvando.
It will always be with us, with the desire to be for a long time.
But if I personally have to say that I am the favorite, I would like to pay attention to the secret magic of the trambolini.
Although trambolin has been known as an Olympic event since 2000 when it was introduced in the Sydney Games, very few people I asked over the past 16 years did not realize that it was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes for the competition, it never won any medal in the trampoline and there was no competitor to rise to the finals until 2012.
In men, the prizes were shared by Chinese and Russian, and in women, Chinese and Canadian.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will try to preserve their gold medals in London this year.
But trambolin attracts attention as a fairly unconscious activity; this may be partly due to the fact that it is considered to be worthy of the school of the doll instead of the Olympics in the unconscious ears.
I have to admit that I am not an expert here, I am only interested in the subject.
It has a funny potential (such as a cartoon-like vibration created by the unfinished jump) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and swimming, the two sports it basically combines.
The word "trambolin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampolin, which means "tramplen".
The championship candidates are jumping almost 30 feet from the air in a large trombus, and they are asked to make a series of movements (burkma, pike and salto) before they fall on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to performance, difficulty and "flight time".
There will be 32 athletes from 17 countries, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common progress in the Olympics is the direct progress.
Those who hope to receive the medal, in some cases in the search for gold to the end point, in some cases to go backward, upward and downward with movements, to go further, faster and upward.
They are not only pursuing the end line or the starting wall, but there is also another challenging line in television broadcast; the world or Olympic record.
This determined effort is noble, immense and even extreme; it is enough to dive even a spectator in his tears.
But this is exactly one of the features I find slightly tired when watching the Games.
Trambolin allows you to break all of this.
Those in the trombus move upward.
Their goals are not moving forward.
Hoping up, it looks like an astronaut without weight, rises up, falls down, and rises up again without trouble.
Of course, it cannot be said that there is no competition or difficulty, but it is a humble study to the outcome during the routine period, there is no loss in the distance, only the time and landscape is elegantly suspended, as it is imagined.
The cool the Olympic race is, the cool the race is.
Women’s rankings and the final afterwards will be held on Friday afternoon at 13.00 in Eastern time; men on Saturday again at 13.00.
The NBC will broadcast the finals in both days as a block afternoon from 14.00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be neglected in general.
And, according to The Wall Street Journal, if the consciousness will grow by offering male athletes just to glimpse and objectivize, as the U.S. male gymnastics recently suggested, we can say Mr. Dooley is waiting for new fans.
A “generation in protest” in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters seeking political change in Ethiopia met with the government’s strong resistance.
Witnesses say a large number of protesters received deadly weapons in the conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia going to collapse?
In the last decade, it has become one of the most stable nations in Africa and a strong ally for the West with its rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have spread to more and more regions every day.
Only last week, thousands of people went out to the streets and demanded fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response to this was quite cruel.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed a large number of unarmed demonstrants.
In the pictures of protests from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, security officials see young people who were forced to stick their hands against a wall.
The United Nations Higher Human Rights Authority is now calling for a detailed review.
Rashid Abdi, the Somali Peninsula project director of the International Crisis Group, said: “It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be much harder to advance.”
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is one of the highest nations in Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight the terrorist threats in the region, mainly in Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that receive such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing impressively.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; even a new suburban train is available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not shown in Ethiopia (human rights groups are constantly referring to the government’s repressive attitude), the national opposition was quite limited, and the opposition was effectively silent.
Most were deported, imprisoned, killed or thrown to the distant corners of the desert.
But that may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, an university faculty from Central Ethiopia, said, “If you dive people and don’t offer them another option than protest, these events come out.”
The youth is in full protest.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints from the use of land to the pressure of the coalition on power.
After the very critical elections last year, the power party and its allies also took the last seat filled by the opposition and now can control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea, a dirty and controversial line that led to a war in which hundreds of people were killed in June, are also increasing.
Analysts are afraid that separatist groups that have disappeared in recent years, such as the Oromo Freedom Front or the Ogaden National Freedom Front, will be rearmed by the turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the painful feelings that have been swallowing under the surface for years are now exploding.
The first one seems innocent: smart phones.
As cheap smartphones are spreading and the internet service is provided, just a few years ago a large number of Ethiopian people began to communicate using social media.
Even when the government closed access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during protests, most people were able to communicate through the internet assistant servers that hid their positions.
A few young Ethiopian people said they were gathered in this way for the protests.
Secondly, the solidarity between the Oromols and Amharas, the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, also increased.
Oromals and Amharas are not usually allies.
For a long time, from the mountainous regions of Ethiopia, which were dominated by Christians, the Amharas were outlined in politics and business and exploiting the Oromos, most of which were Muslims and lived in flat lands.
But that also changes.
A Oromo leader, Mulatu Gemechu, said, “We are gathering under a shadow and moving forward towards cooperation.”
The major protests were seen in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigraian ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominated by the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebellion leader Mr. Meles served as the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died from an unprecedented disease in 2012.
It was thought to be a tactical giant that everyone could not see.
Analysts say he is specialized in detecting the first signs of discomfort and stimulating and disactivating competitors.
Conflict analyst Mr. Abdi said "the current regime does not have this basic information."
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected in relatively uncertainty to place Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is southern.
Analysts say he could not gain the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigers.
As a result, more blood was thrown with more fear.
Ethiopia's latest experience of such a confusion was the protest of thousands of analysts in 2005 after the government's defensive election.
In the following measures, though less than a month ago, many protesters were killed, and this period of confusion passed relatively faster.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning and remarkable progress in the fight against poverty, such as the new suburban train.
But it is clear that this does not stop the rise of the protest against the Ethiopian government.
This is a dangerous and ethnic situation.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town of Amhara, attacked the companies owned by the Tigers, and the hatred of the Tigers is also increasing on social media.
Analysts say the protests left the United States and other allies in the West in a strange situation.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft flights over neighboring Somalia; but it was recently that the base was closed.
Although the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want that the allies in a already vulnerable region to break down.
Mr. Abdi said "This" and added "as walking on a very thin thread."
Donald Trump has declared Obama’s claim to establish ISIS as “legitimate”
Donald J. Trump on Friday, last week several times insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were not serious while claiming that they were the “founder” of the Islamic State terror group, trying to eradicate the last dispute around his campaign.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to communicate clearly with the American people.
At the same time, in the process that created this confusion, he put into a strange position in the process that he attempted to explain that it was not the statement that his lawyers made their best to defend him.
Mr. Trump insisted that in the interviews, by further strengthening his Thursday thesis after being presented on this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, President and Mrs. Clinton indeed indicated that they had established the ISIS.
But in a post on Twitter early on Friday morning, Mr. Trump said he was just in a ridiculous statement.
The message showed that Mr. Trump had been completely back a day before he said he was serious about the accusation in a series of interviews.
The conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy the ISIS and when Mr. Trump tried to help him soften this commentary, the Republican presidential candidate said he didn’t believe it.
Mr. Trump found the last confusion when he tried to change the focus of his campaign after the fall in the surveys.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held conflicting talks on the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to return to this issue again.
She once again tweeted that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes and she found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump had previously used the defense of joke.
At the end of July, after the Russians showed a appearance suggesting Miss Clinton's emails to be hacked, after they met great criticism, she explained these comments, saying, "Naturally, I said it ridiculously."
This approach will enable Mr. Trump to force the political speech limits and move back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who follows the language both candidates use, said, “This is an order that allows him to make a way of “explain” depending on the response by testing how certain messages are reacted by those who support him.”
But at the same time, he deliberately gives these statements and knows that it is uncertain enough to be filtered from different spots.
After the recent decrease in surveys, Mr. Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude instead of softening the air for the general election crowd.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed Mr. Trump is far behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado and there is a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often refuses to apologize for the provocative things he says, he accuses those who criticize himself of distorting his words or misunderstanding his humor.
But Mr. Trump’s jokes, which have been much more investigated in the last months of his presidential campaign, make it difficult for the public to support his faithful supporters, though his comments are provocative.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made his best to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday as one of Mr. Trump’s most prominent supporters.
When asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s thesis on Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton’s establishment of the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said, “I think it’s a legitimate, political criticism.”
From one point of view, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, those who found them cute were completely wrong, and that was because of the military withdrawal from Iraq.
The most prominent Republicans are trying to defend that Mrs. Clinton’s administration as the Secretary of State failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East and caused ISIS to grow.
Before the meetings in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to accuse the media on Twitter of distorting every word and behaving opposite to it.
“The poor, painful” who tried to solve himself, laughed with television experts and said, “They can’t do that!”
Some Democrats, laughing at Mr. Trump’s excuse, said that it was evidence that he was not suitable for the presidency.
Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee Coffee
Whilst Verb Cafe, a old stumbled place in Williamsburg, did not offer Wi-Fi connection, it has been offering great coffee for 15 years.
Of course, he couldn’t deal with the prices in the store at Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, the store, which replaced Verb, sold soap cherie in the form of cabbage cake.
The inhabitants of the area were close to saying that this was the last loss of the covert city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know that but I still can't believe that CBGB is gone and Chelsea Hotel is empty and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is the city of re-inventing as much as change.
Last November, a renewed Verb Cafe was opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile away from its original location, in the north.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit card but preserves some old employees and similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
At the beginning of the new Verb, the long-term employee of the old cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, the owner and chief executive of the new place.
He joined Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
A customer said he would be excited to do so when he offered him funding for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), left most things the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for simits and purchased an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the lights of the old Verb were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
Added new materials.
Pasta-egg-and-sandwichs are available in the menu and are also provided with ingredients such as cabbage and smoothies.
There are rocky rocks.
The cafe no longer serves beer but offers fresh fruit waters.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he realized that the former officers began to come firmly.
He said, “Many of our old customers were unable to deal with the prices in Williamsburg.”
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and frequently visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he did not stop moving on this path.
He said he stopped drinking coffee for a while after the verb was closed.
“I realized that what I loved was coffee and culture in Verb.”
Now he started drinking coffee again but last day he chose the tea mixture, which was a new add-on instead of the usual ice coffee.
Another agent, Tom Rosenthal, has been regularly visiting Verb since 2003.
He goes there before work and always gives the same order.
"Every day, about seven quarters, I would enter without any surprise and they were preparing my order of butter every day."
Photo Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make a change and added new materials to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal still receives its usual order, but sometimes it makes a bit of change by adding pasta, eggs and cheese to its daily order.
Mr. Rodriguez said he was not stuck in the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, Soap Cherie’s owners proposed to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee’s cold-smalled coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, “I think we can still accept this proposal.”
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu to Spanish and Mr. Rodriguez said he will find a space to show this menu soon so that his new neighbors will also feel good.
The new position has other advantages.
The local fruit juice store wants to bottle and sell the cold cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will be expanded to the nearby building.
It is enough for most customers to have a new Verb available to find their old favourites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and was very sad after the room was closed.
When the new room was opened, Mr. Whitt said that being able to enter and drink coffee made him feel at home.
“I had to smell it.”
The Depressive Food of the Crisis Time in A Square Meal
In March 1933, immediately after sitting on the presidency seat, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, who was a loving one of his throat, loved the decorated Fifth Avenue foods, such as cranberries and Maryland Rabbit Soup.
The menu of that day was much more humble: cooked eggs with tomato sauce, potato pepper and sweetly also dried dried pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said, “This was an action aimed at building solidarity with the people in trouble about eating.”
His wife, Andrew Coe, added: "This was also a message given to Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights, a food historian.
Mr. Coe's last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman also told her book "97 Orchard" about the lives in the canyons in the Lower East by eating.
A Square Meal, a new book they work together and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American foods during the Great Bukharan period.
They also met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in Flatiron, which has existed since 1929 when the crisis began, showing their solidarity with food.
While Mrs. Ziegelman (54), ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57), preferred to sit in hindi, potato pears and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order of roll-buffet suitable for the discussion of foods during the crisis period.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, “Summons were very popular.”
There was a soil of potatoes, a liver soil, a dry beans soil.
It was made of a cheap material with a material.
Think that you have eaten enough potato for dinner.
Mr. Coe scratched his face.
He said, “It should have been sitting in the stomach of a man.”
In the years before the crisis, the tables in America were like open buffets, especially in rural areas.
Women cooked food for men who worked in the farm, and fresh cooked cakes were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans were sending food to Europeans who died of hunger during World War I. A Square Meal describes the history of the methods of dealing with the nation’s outcome from being the center of abundance at once.
Mr Coe explained why he and his wife wanted to write about this topic, saying, “This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans.”
The new budget regime was equally worrying: mysterious foods such as sandwiches and beans became the main consumption product, according to Mrs. Ziegelman, "the beans were a great way to evaluate the remaining foods" so chefs could hide the appetite-stoping ingredients below with a cream-covered sauce.
He replaced fresh fruits with dried fruits that were cheaper.
Meat, found in the center of American foods for years, has become a luxury that is passionately shared.
Interesting compounds for calorie and nutritional value were tested and the feeling of saturation passed ahead of the taste or general understanding of the kitchen.
While Mrs. Ziegelman was doing research for her book containing the recipes, she prepared the flour food in the oven filled with the cabbage of that period.
Mr Coe said, "This dinner was not a favourite contribution to the table."
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this: “This was surreal.”
There is no common point with the flour in the oven.
In the majority of household economies, this was an outstanding feature.
Home economists, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Home Economy, directed the country’s eating habits as never before between 1923 and 1943.
By publishing the recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "saving" and spread the struggle to transform spaghetti-like spaghetti-like spaghetti-like spaghetti-like spaghetti-like spaghetti-like spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a party consisting of historic delicious foods.
The government’s response to the hungry citizens, like President Herbert Hoover’s “Let’s eat cake” attitude, is extremely appetite.
He, on the one hand, was eating the simple Iowa farmers’ meals in his public childhood, while on the other hand he was eating foods like the millionaire intellectual.
Mr Coe said, "He loved to eat European cuisine tastes like saladed fish."
Their meals were dressed in jackets that were suitable for their dinner, and they were eating in a almost completely golden-covered dining room.
He was far from the truth.
If his wife Eleanor did not encourage her to be the example with her stomach, President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
As the book tells us, with Mrs. Roosevelt hiring an assistant who didn’t care at all for the taste, the White House began to offer “not only the most sad foods ever prepared, but also the best prepared tables.”
After the country came back on its feet, most of the methods of cooking during the crisis were abandoned.
According to Mrs. Ziegelman, calorie and nutrition-focused understanding and the way science applies to cooking continues.
The couple, while writing the book, stated that she learned a lot from Mrs. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example, she could never give food to the dust.
Mr Coe said, “Food waste really scared him.”
Mrs. Ziegelman spoke about her old memories: "It really happened that people were sick."
The Kremlin crash occurred.
After the tables were gathered at Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe brought out a sweets they prepared at home: the dried, dried sweets that President Roosevelt ate at lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, “It’s called cracked dry erik,” and added that the most frequently applied number was to give these modest recipes a warm name.
There was no scratched cream; only dry ery, a little butter, sugar, water and garlic.
Everyone hesitated not to find a brown stick.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t so bad.
Mr Coe took the second and third teaspoons.
As someone could be saved, he said to his wife, "It would be better to have a bit of cabbage brown."
In the fight against hepatitis C with Merck, Gilead will receive lawyer fees
In accordance with the decision of the U.S. regional judge, Gilead Sciences Inc. gained the right to receive lawyer fees in connection with the hepatitis C patent case conducted with the drug manufacturer Merck & Co. Inc.
After the U.S. judge found that Merck was in a series of misconduct, including false witnesses and other unethical practices, Gilead was dismissed from paying $200 million compensation for the violation of the two Merck patents related to Gilead’s great success in June.
In a trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had the right to be compensated for the wages incurred during the proceedings.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, the market judge, with the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case is based on the year 2013 in which Gilead and Merck claimed to have the right to the property of the laboratory work done for sofosbuvir, the active substance of Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed forces said Membic's control was completely taken from the Islamic State.
On Friday, the group’s spokesman said the U.S.-backed forces and the last Islamic State fighters in the city also took full control of the city of Membiç near the Turkish border, in the north.
A group of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDGs) remaining hidden in the city, after the departure, is in the cleaning stage of the city.
Sharfan Derwish, a member of the Membic Military Council in alliance with the SDG, told the Routers that they have released more than 2,000 civilian hostages in their hands.
He told Routers, “The city is now fully under our control, but we are carrying out cleaning work.”
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton announced its 2015 tax statement on Friday that the Democratic candidate and his wife earned $10.75 million last year and paid federal taxes at 34.2 percent in force.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to the charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation, earning approximately $5.3 million from ex-president Bill Clinton's speech fees, and the former Foreign Minister declared that he earned $3 million in revenue for his book from the publisher Simon & Schuster in relation to the time he spent in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate friend, the U.S. Senator, Tim Kaine from Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, issued a 10-year tax declaration.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax of 20.3 percent.
Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency."
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses about his promises to disclose his previous tax statements and goes back.
Although the laws do not require it, it is a tradition that U.S. presidential candidates present their tax statements publicly.
Trump and his lawyers, a New York businessman, said the reason for the rejection of the statements was a revision carried out by the Revenue Administration.
In connection with the declarations of the Democratic candidate, Clinton campaign officer Ian Sams tweeted "The turn is on you."
On Thursday, Trump’s special prosecutor Michael Cohen told CNN that he will not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are completed.
The group, which criticized Trump, including Republican candidate Mitt Romney and other Republicans, in 2012, said that the rejection of Trump was a questioning sign about his own authenticity, his contribution to the charities, his business agreements and many other connections, including what happened with Russia.
Clinton posted a video on the internet on Friday that high-level Republicans pressed Trump to declare their taxes.
He said this question on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.
He said to the crowd, “For decades, he refused to do what every presidential candidate did, to publish his tax declarations.”
Politico that Trump had almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business department county writer shared the statements of a series of tax lawyers and accountants that the situation could still continue in this way.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has proposed a rule called the billionaire investor Warren Buffet, which will allow those who earn more than $1 million a year to pay tax at least 30 percent.
President Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton meeting in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group operating there challenged Buffett to come to Trump and present his tax declaration.
Buffett said he was also going through the IRS control and Trump was "fearful" not of the tax authority, but of the voters.
Clinton published its tax declarations in its campaign until 2007.
The Clinton family, currently living in New York, Chappaqua, has paid an average federal tax of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and the joint tax rate reaches approximately 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, their income is only about $100 from wages.
Its main investments are a low-cost index investment fund and Clinton’s family has declared that its interest and interest revenues are $109,000.

Powder red pepper condoms, castan fires support the protection of the elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw on them condoms filled with dust red pepper.
The method has been proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation and the US-based Nature Conservation Association, which found this idea a few years ago, have taken steps to promote it; in northern Tanzania villages, volunteers have begun to train on the use of the non-violent, four-step method of protecting their houses and crops from damaging animals.
In the past, the majority of the people used the shell to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
Honeyguide Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement: "We have seen the attitude in these communities has changed since we have developed the vehicle set; they are now more confident that they can keep the foil away from their land without damaging the foil."
The first two steps include keeping the passing file lamp and playing the corna.
In cases where this is not possible, what is called the "red pepper cloud" is thrown.
The powder mixed with the soil red pepper is placed in the preservative with a castan foam, only the end is closed so that the fünye remains open.
When it burns, the preservative opens with a sound of explosion and red pepper breaks into the air in dust.
A single breath is enough to send the foil to the other direction.
The last solution is to use a flame that throws a fire into the air, which causes a high sound, bright explosion.
The Jewish filmmaker shot the hotel in Berlin, which removed the Israeli telephone code on the Arabs' "demand" - RT News
A Jewish French filmmaker caused sensation in the media after it revealed that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not list Israel’s phone code and that the employee predicted Arab customers’ “requests”.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" about the genocide, expressed his anger to the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin with an open letter to the German broadcaster FAZ.
Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel on his short stay.
But the country was not among the states that could be sought directly from the room.
In 2016, how could Israel be destroyed and destroyed in Berlin, the new German capital?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of searching for Israel through its own call center.
The filmmaker the situation to the hotel's reception to get an explanation.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received "shocked him."
The hotel's secretary said that the measure was taken by "a deliberate decision of the Kempinski-Hotels administration".
The reason under this movement caused the filmmaker to be much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the staff said, “Most of our guests wanted the Arab and Israeli code to be deleted.”
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli Ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the situation as “a great shame.”
This scared us and surprised us very much.
This is really a great shame.
It’s a big shame that this has happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain.
This does not need to be explained.
We look forward to the hotel’s result,” the author said.
The incident raised a great reaction in the online environment; people described this situation as a scandal.
Some have accused Kempinski Hotel of “blowing” the so-called requests of Arab customers.
In another post, the expression "You should be ashamed" was insisted by emphasizing that the hotel was located near a synagogue, on the Kurfurstendamm street.
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly dismissed the accusations, saying the incident was a result of "unattention" and "forgiveness" from Lanzmann.
Suddeutsche Zeitung said one of Kempinski’s representatives said “There was never a direct order that Israel should not be included in the fast search list.”
He said they had added the code.
Brazilian police use plastic and pepper gas against protesters
Students gathered on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo to demonstrate against the government’s reforms in the public education system.
The police used plastic and pepper gas against the protesters.
The problem began when security officers tried to disperse students, which led the police to use plastic missiles and pepper gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the show to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
According to the proposal by Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed for savings and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the protesters appeared to write letters against the temporary President Michel Temer on the wall.
This last protest took place a few days after the protesters came to the street in masses to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was resigned by the country’s Senate’s vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran rises to 71% - RT Business
According to Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade circle between Moscow and Tehran has grown by 70.9 percent per year.
The ambassador said the interest of Russian companies operating in the country has increased significantly since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted.
While new companies are preparing to provide access to the market, Russian companies continue to maintain existing ties with Iran.
Of course, the further growth of trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
In the first five months of 2016, the trade circle between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to 697 million dollars.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
This increase in trade was achieved by machinery, ground vehicles and weapons-driven materials,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic representation in Iran granted 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
Also, for the first time, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say that the record of Iranian tourists who visited Russia last year will be broken.”
At the same time, relatively less Russians visit Iran; this is a matter that the ambassador hopes to change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are stored in good condition.”
Cash to FETÖ from Izmir - Economic News
Interesting details about Kavuklar Group Board Chairman Abdullah Kavuk and Küçükbay Group Board Chairman Ahmet Küçükbay, who were arrested for financial support to FETÖ, began to appear.
FETÖ’s 1 and 2 financial sources in Izmir, Küçükbay and Kavuk’s FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization’s head, Fetullah Gülen, were determined to send a regular amount of money charged with the mail every month.
The money sent to Gülen in order to not pass to the records was not deposited through the banks, the organization member was sent through the mail.
On the other hand, in the framework of the investigation of the FETÖ coup attempt in Amasya, 9 people who were sent to court and including the President of the Merzifon Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Fatih Altınay, were arrested, 7 people were released under the conditions of judicial control.
30,000 pounds in 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s call to “low the interest rate” has led the banks to move.
First it was suggested that the banks should be included in the campaign that the real estate housing launched and then GYODER participated in.
The proposal was made by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to cut the housing loan interest rates below 1 per cent as a psychological limit.
13 banks pulled their housing loans interests below 1 percent.
The public banks started the discount fury.
Based on the monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 to 1.29 per cent before, with the latest arrangement, consumers using a 10-year housing loan will pay less interest between 15 and 30 billion TL.
Preferred 5 to 10
So, how much benefits will interest rates bring to those who get home?
A person using a 10 year-long loan of £100,000 will benefit £30,000 from the interest rate fall.
The vast majority of people who use housing loans choose a 5-10 year-long payment plan.
The interest rates are expected to fall further in the coming days.
The interest rate discount will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased 10.6 per cent compared to the previous year, up to 1 million 289 thousand.
This year, sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million.
GYODER President Aziz Torun: It should be lowered by 9 percent per year
This is an important step towards the bank’s interest rate.
They listened to the call of our president and lowered the interests.
This rate should be below 9 per cent per year.
If this discount process continues, we will also consider extending the monthly 0.70 interest campaign that we have launched for a few months.
The Dwarf: Our campaign can last for three months
The participation of the banks in this initiative to bring life to the economy that we have limited as a month can also lead to the prolongation of the duration of this historic campaign for at least 3-4 months.
However, the interest rate should fall below 9 per cent on the annual basis.
It is also pleasant to see that only the housing sector and the real market will create positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity with the citizens in the housing acquisition that each sector is sacrificing.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We look forward to full support from banks
It is a good step to go to the interest rate discount on the call of our president to the banks.
In addition, there are a number of steps taken towards the recovery of the economy in all sectors.
The campaigns made by the NGOs, the decision taken by the Central Bank and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country.
All banks have to put their hands under the stone.
Come to them, join us, walk along the same path with us, and let us give life to the economy together.
5.5 billion TL investment in 1.5 years from Sabancı
Sabancı Holding increased its net profit in the first six months of this year by 11 percent compared to the same period of last year to 1 billion 353 million lbs, and its sales increased by 22 percent to 17 billion 166 million lbs.

2 years to enjoy the boat from Kabataş
Due to the "Kabataş Square Regulation, Transfer Center and Scale Renovation Construction" carried out by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IMB), the Kabataş ship is closed for sea traffic for about two years.
A modern transfer center will be built on the Kabataş coast to integrate the sea, rail system and road transport.
Traffic will be underground and there will be uninterrupted pedestrian flow along the beach.
The trains and phunicular systems will continue to work for a while.
In order to ensure the transportation of citizens to Taksim, Eminönü, Beşiktaş areas, ring flights will be launched.
The house has fallen, the house has risen.
A bank manager sent a message to my friend.
It always happens the same thing.
The prices are falling, the prices of houses are rising.
Rates are rising, housing prices are falling.
“Look it happened again,” he said.
He tells him about his feelings because he is related to individual loans.
Property Housing says that the contractors who entered the 0.70-percent campaign organized by Property Housing said the prices in many housing projects were raised.
I watched if there was a part of truth.
There is no shortage, there is no shortage...
Meanwhile, I thought we had a conversation with a contractor who took part in the construction summit that our newspaper organized a week after the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization's 15th July coup attempt.
The boss of a big company.
When I heard of the contractor that I will not give his name, "I really need to increase the prices by 10 percent," I said, "Will you make the opportunity to hit?"
After the coup initiative, with the campaign led by the Real Estate Housing, the builders launched a large sales campaign with 0.70 interest and 120 months of duration.
I accept, he put his hand under the stone before the banks, taking the risk.
But as long as we move with the spirit of unity and solidarity to not cut the speed of Turkey.
One month of your campaign, the banks also supported by reducing interest rates.
No one should make an increase opportunity.
Be warned of what you do.
President Erdoğan accepted Omar Koç and Ali Koç
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Koç Holding Board Chairman Omer Mehmet Koç and Koç Holding Board Deputy Chairman and Ford Otosan Board Chairman Ali Koç were accepted.
Erdogan's reception in the Presidential Hall took 40 minutes.
Call from BDDK: Let those banks complain
Banking Regulation and Supervisory Authority (BDDK) chairman Mehmet Ali Akben has made a statement on the President Erdoğan's warning of "credit recall" to banks.
Akben said, "If banks turn the loan withdrawal into an opportunity because of the market conditions and do it with different values, we will definitely not allow it."
To those who bring such complaints and information to us, we say, ‘Dating the name on the basis of the bank and company, be in the BDDK complaint line’.
President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks in a statement: "I say that when interest rates fall, credit opportunities are expanded, a new period will be opened in front of both our country and our investors and banks."
In this period of our country should stop giving loans, the banks that call the loans back with a pattern of excuse mean that they have a net set to them, and I want to announce that.
At the time the interest rates were 7-8 per cent per year, the banks earned money from this business.
More than 500,000 Russian tourists are expected
The President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD) Ali Kızıldağ, at the meeting held in the EXPO 2016 Antalya exhibition area, said that before the 15th July coup attempt, the relations between Turkey and Russia entered a positive route, the flight flights from Russia to Antalya began and a certain revival in tourism occurred.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s meeting excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries, “I expect to have very positive developments in terms of both tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textile all sectors.”
Turkey and Russia are very close to each other, we have traditional relationships based on years.
“As the sectors on this path that the leaders of the two countries open, I think that if we make very fast progress, we can immediately close the distances and move towards the goals,” he said.
If there were no attempts, the number of Russian tourists arriving in Turkey would exceed one million.
But we lost a month in the high season, so the goal is to be reduced.
I still think if charter flights begin, we will exceed 500,000 numbers.
The season may be extended by the end of October and even the middle of November.
In such a case, additional flights can be placed toward Christmas.
I expect this positive weather to be very well appreciated by the Russian people.
They also have an interest in Turkey.
I'm sure I'm going to think that I'm going to have 700,000.
In terms of the Russian market, they are hopeful for 2017 as well as the relations of the two countries as well as the Russian economy is recovered, the number of Russian tourists could again rise over 3 million next year.
With the removal of the permit prohibition of public staff, POYD Chairman Kızıldağ said that domestic reservations began slightly, "There are returns in the cancelled reservations, new reservations began to be taken."
“We have a hopeful expectation for the Victims’ Day.”
He said that the lifting of the tour ticket prohibition placed to travel agencies by Iran after the coup attempt was a very positive development, "It would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in 1.2-2 months."
The existing loan?
First of all, talk to the bank you have borrowed and learn how the new interest conditions formed affect your loan.
Calculate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest along with the early closing fee (up to 1.5-2 percent of the usual fee) from your bank.
If you are still advantageous when you include all the costs, you can apply for the use of low interest loan.
There is no breath to the Lion.
The last champion Beşiktaş, winning the Super Cup match he will play with Galatasaray, is aiming to enter the moral in the new season.
Technical Director Shenol Sun, who built all his plans on victory, said in his interview with his demands, "We must play temporarily and aggressively."
“I’m waiting for you to have a high percentage of pass and the ball control for 90 minutes,” he said.
It was found that the players who did not think to drive the sports, including Sosa, to the field were uncertain about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced worker tried Necip at the stop during the week, but if Adriano played at the left side, Tosic will play at the stop.
The Sun, which will also be a preference between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also made the ball run behind their demands after a long interval.

The assets of the FETÖ elephant Gülen were removed.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the case in which the number one accused, Fetullah Gülen, was prosecuted for the crime of "proofing to eradicate the constitutional order", the court commission, with Gülen, issued an arrest decision on the accused, Omer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu.
However, the court ruled that for the four accused who have not been arrested and who have not come to trial until this time, the evacuation process will be carried out.
Adana 2.The Heavy Criminal Court then decided that all the assets of Fetullah Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who are in a foreign country in order to ensure that the case in their rights remains unsuccessful and therefore have not been able to reach it, will be handed away in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedures Act (CMK).
With this judgment of the court, the non-transport in Turkey, the maritime and air transport vehicles, all kinds of rights and receipts, valuable documents, the company shares in which the partner is located, the rental cash stocks and bank accounts were frozen.
Hussein laughing: the collapse of Gülen is due to the collapse of three legs
Hussein, who explained the attempt to push the FETÖ, laughed in shocking explanations.
The words of Hussein laughing are as follows:
As I think they’re going to try to hit this topic for the past 5-6 months, I wrote in my writings that “they can work, but they can’t do the order in the command chain.”
I didn’t know two things: the first is that it was widespread and profound in this scale, for example, the eight-year command officer of the General Commander of the Jandarma and the gentlemen of Mr. President.
Mr. President is the most struggling person, who knows how he has been careful when choosing his puppies but the most important feature of them is unprecedented privacy.
There are two faces.
One of the most important evidence of the expression "this is not a job that a retiree can do like FETÖ" is that it is so deep.
He must be supported by the CIA.
The CIA has taken away this person very early.
Mahmut Övür says in 2014 that in 1971 they met with Fatullah Gülen in the house of Vehbi Koç.
The people of that time who were most interested in these affairs said it was the time when the relations between the MIT and the CIA were closest.
Our armed forces paid the salary of the US staff, and after not remembering it, one man came out like that.
When we learn this, in 2014.
After this post by Mr. Mahmut, there was no explanation that denied it.
For example, a fair orphan was caught in a row, right?
I wonder who this is.
He went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup and returned two days ago.
He has gone abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you gather all of this together, it is necessary to be investigated; it is necessary to be investigated who have gone to the United States with an excuse since March 1999, when all of the escapers now have gone to the United States, and who have gone to the United States with an excuse.
They were going to Pennsylvania on an occasion.
But the real contacts with the CIA can be detected from here; there were many people sent to the United States in security, especially from the people who had to be raised from the security.
The Wikileaks documentation contains: Gülen establishes a association and the association holds joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, the CIA had been working to officially demonstrate that connection.
Fuat Avni is an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania I said 2 years ago.
The prime minister is working for Fuat Avni.
But the bad thing is that the information fell to the CIA as it fell to Pennsylvania.
The collapse of Gülen is due to the collapse of three legs; one we call the base, which formed a friendly ring, there are those who are in a very deep hypnosis, they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
I said three feet, a base support.
Theft of questions, theft, the defeat of the slave right, this base supported a lot.
The other two feet: political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support is the documentation that the recordings of Baykal and MHP's managers were drawn by FETÖ.
After the 15th of July, the "FETÖ" was also used by Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu, who opened the eyes of everyone.
He laughed and said, “I don’t do it, it’s around me.”
She says to me, "Yah, Mr. Hussein, these girl requests see very different dreams, they send me, I've now banned, because it's not right to act with dreams."
A sound record fell, the person who spoke in the sound record Barbaros Kocakurt: My teacher friends dreamed, double the tweet of our Prophet.
A police officer killed in Nusaybin.
According to the information obtained, the armed vehicles of the police in the Selahaddin Eyyubi district, where the police carrying out the mission of deployment, were shot with long-lasted weapons by terrorists.
In the first fire, a police officer was killed and a police officer was injured.
Two terrorists were dismissed in the struggle after the police responded.
The wounded police were transferred to the Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are ongoing in the area.
The TV broadcasts have not stopped.
In the evening of July 15, private television, which had an important part in the prevention of the coup attempt, continued broadcasting in Turksat thanks to a technical staff who held heroic resistance to the coupers.
This is the hero...
At the time of reading the report in TRT, Akkaya expressed that they entered resistance psychology with the instructions to interrupt the broadcast, "I took everything by thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire opened by the helicopter."
They asked me to put my weapons on my head and cut the publications.
I just turned off local TVs.
Then I told them we had to go to the antenna and let them get away from the building.
I spent up to 20 minutes on the antenna section.
“I cut some cables here again, but I didn’t touch the broadcasts.”
When the Darbeciler failed to stop broadcasting in Turksat, they brought the experts of Samanyolu TV.
The terrorists were arrested by police who arrived three minutes before the incident.
When the Darbecis returned to the building about 1 hour later he realized that the TV broadcasts were ongoing with the phone that came to them, and at that moment he said that the nose came to the nose with death, Akkaya said that they lived as follows:
I took the strike that night at 8 p.m.
He emanated us there.
One of my friends was a guard for the e-state and the electric system.
When we met to drink tea at 21.00 a.m., a low-flight helicopter passed over us.
There were a few more aircraft flying quietly from the bottom around the helicopter.
We saw the lights.
It was an unmanned aircraft that could take a picture.
They were flying in front of helicopters.
I’ve been there for 11 years, for the first time I saw such a close flight.
Then a movement began.
When we looked at the news, the bridge was closed.
At that time, our general manager ordered the friends who were not in security at that moment to come to the building.
When we went to Nizamiye to get information, we learned that the packages of all the publications in TRT fell.
TRT broadcasts were interrupted for 5 minutes.
I called for the TRT main command, but I couldn't get it.
Our control station said the TRT broadcasts came back and the announcement began to be read.
Our Deputy Director Halil Greşilçimen, under the instructions of the Director General, called for the urgent cessation of TRT publications.
We started to work to stop broadcasting because TRT 3 has a broad broadcast from the channel.
We recently heard that Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said “There is a breakthrough.”
The command of our director 'cross the TRT' brought us into a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut the TRT, and after a while we heard the helicopter sound.
We went out, the helicopter dropped down to Nizamiye shoot everywhere, everyone was dispersed.
We are hiding in a building on the back.
We were 12 people.
When we passed back, the soldiers coming down from the helicopter entered.
A few of our friends were arrested by soldiers.
We did not leave them alone.
At that time, I saw the assistant general captured and fell on the knees.
The soldiers were talking to each other.
“Let’s shoot one of them, let them be afraid.”
Then they put us all inside.
The commanders began to scream, “Who is the responsible here, I will not ask again.”
When we heard the speaking of the style 'Let's shoot one', we thought: 'We don't know about the country, but a instructions came to us, 'Current TRT'.
There is a resistance.
I felt that I had abandoned myself at that moment.
I said ‘my’.
I stood up without knowing what to do.
The only thing I thought at that moment was that my friends were shot off from the helicopter.
I thought 10-15 of my friends were martyrs in Nizamiy, and when I thought they would kill us in the end, there was a comfort on me.
The commander in the head said 'You will cut all the publications except TRT'.
We have a system section that we monitor local channels when we go to the satellite.
80 of the 200 local channels are broadcast from the room.
I thought this room came.
There was no national publication among them.
If I cut them off and say that all of them are cut off, at least until that time the support comes from the outside will get help.
I said he would go where he was going.
Finally, we agreed that we could not get out.
“I’m going to cut.”
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power button to the monitors we can watch the national channels.
There were no signals on all screens.
I said I had to go to the antenna so that it could be completely cut.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, and one of the soldiers said, “Stop on the ground.”
He struck my weapon.
“You will cut them all except TRT, there will be no one left, I will hit one of you in the end, that will be you.”
I’ve said, “When you go, you’ll see it all’s frozen,” and I’ve said nothing else.
We entered the station and cut off the local publications.
We went to the other antenna.
At that time, there was a system of approximately 20 national channels in my hands.
When the local channels were cut off, about 20 monitors were lost.
My Lord has helped us so that we have not been troubled when we answered, and he has closed their basirs.
They believed in the answers we gave.
They did not exceed.
This relaxed us.
When they came out, they asked the place of the trail.
“I don’t know I’m a TV broadcaster,” he asked, “Is there an electricist among you?”
“There’s no electricist after the evening, if there’s a failure, the team will come.”
There was an electricist at that time.
I thought I didn’t stop the broadcasts.
I also wanted to cut off the soldiers.
They relaxed a little because they thought the broadcasts were interrupted.
They couldn’t see the publications.
The group went to wait.
About an hour later, when they opened the TV in the waiting room, they saw A News broadcast.
The soldiers entered.
“My commander didn’t stop the news.”
We looked at the commander.
He said “stay up.”
I stood up.
At that time, a soldier said, “There are continuing publications.”
“There are channels that broadcast in Cyprus.”
“They are broadcasting through the Cyprus, we can’t do anything to them.”
“Then he wrote to someone and then he raised us all up and walked.”
They fled from Turksat with a minibus.
I saw from the pictures that the soldier who took me to the toilet and gave water was executed in the seat of that minibus.
They shot three times on their forehead and on their forehead.
My friends confirmed that they were the same soldiers.
They were calling us the “child”.
Per he was a soldier.
They may be executed to get rid of it.
Asim Akkaya said the first police team came to Turksat from Gölbaşı.
The police team learned that there were helicopters around, and when the security officers were scaned, they returned to the district and went to pick up the munitions.
They came back 40 minutes later.
When the police arrived, Turksat didn’t see anyone in the outskirts.
After only 3-4 minutes from the police, Akkaya said that the alleged experts sent from Samanyolu TV came to the building, "The police team said 'they called us from inside, we are Turkish staff, we need to urgently enter'.
“When the police asked about their identity, four of them suddenly hugged their phones and told us that we were captured.”

Cevat Yıldırım and Hatice Yıldırım were released under the condition of judicial control and the ban on foreign exit.
When he came to court, Cevat Yıldırım called on his cousin to give up, saying, "I am at the state."
Give God the trouble.
I don’t really know the Orphan that I know for 18 years.
I don’t have a fair orphan.
I want him to be caught a moment earlier.
He can not live in the world, nor can he live in the world.
You believe in Turkish justice.
If he made a mistake, he will be punished.
It makes us trouble escaping.
Unfortunately for the government, unfortunately for the government.
For 20-25 days, the police did not do anything else.
Yıldırım said that Turkey doesn’t want it to return to Syria, “We need not the coup, but work.”
We do not want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbor like Turkey.
He has a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“What do we do with our blow?” he said.

He saw the shark in Ergenekon, FETÖ killed
The Attorney General of the Republic of Ankara is investigating the role of the FETÖ in the mysterious death of the Special Operation Department President Behçet Oktay, who closed the file "suicide" in 2009.
Former Security Intelligence Department Chairman Ramazan Akyürek, who remained in the same lojmand with Oktay and listened to Oktay with a false name as a Hezbollah terror organization suspect 6 days before his death, is the main suspect in the investigation.
According to the Ergenekon investigation, some of the munitions captured were stolen and buried from the Special Operations Office by the security team of the FETO, and it is also said that Oktay was killed because it was identified.
In Ankara on 25 February 2009, the death of the President of the Special Operations, Behçet Oktay, was called "suicide."
There were a lot of questions in the event.
Two years after the legal struggle of his family and family lawyers and the evidence he revealed, this time the murder investigation was opened.
The gun that Oktay said he shot himself was in his right hand.
Furthermore, cramps were detected in the bone and traces in the body.
The case for the murder was opened in May 2012.
In the case of murder, only Halil Kesici, who was on his side at the time of his death, was found in his hand with a barut trace.
The court ended the trial.
Nurhan Önder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office, said that Oktay was involved in the death, was sentenced to 6 months in prison for the "crime and misconduct of judicial authorities".
The soldiers are questioned.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor who called the incident "suicide" Hussein Yalçin retired, advanced to Mustafa Düzgün Court, who conducted the murder investigation.
The Oktay family, along with the prosecutors, wants the autopsy prosecutor Nihat Yıldırım to be investigated.
Behçet Oktay's sister Shule Oktay and brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers found many requests during the trial.
The family, who said it was not possible for Halil Kesici to kill special-trained Oktay alone, called for an extension of the investigation.
The family said the incident was covered, the prosecutors called for the identification and trial of security officials who wanted to close the file as suicide by Hussein Yalçin and Mustafa Düzgün and Behçet Oktay.
While all the family's requests were rejected, it was revealed that Oktay was rested six days before his death with the false name "Abdurrahman Doğru" as a member of the Hezbollah terror organization.
According to the report, the head of the security intelligence department of the time was Ramazan Akyürek.
On this development, the Ankara Republic's Prosecutor's Office, which re-examined the Behçet Oktay file, began to investigate the fingers of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÖ) in the murder.
The case on Oktay's illegal rest in Ankara's Heavy Criminal Court will begin on September 19.
Behind him there is a fate.
The family of Oktay, with whom the Sabbath met, is hopeful of the current investigation.
Members of the family say the FETÖ finger in the murder was covered during the previous demonstration investigation and trial.
The sister Shule Oktay said, “This murder was actually a demonstration.”
We could not perceive.
My brother said before he was killed, “You’ll eat me.”
I said ‘Who’.
He then pointed to me the fate.
I thought I would be taken off.
I never remembered the death.
Behind this work, there is a fate.
“The government was in the hands of them.”
He called to the family of the young man and joined his prayer.

The kidnapping people protect the PKK.
For more than four decades, Turkey, which has been struggling to end the terrorism of the PKK, has begun to face the day when it has not been able to destroy the organization’s leaders in this struggle.
The FETO militants, who have penetrated the critical institutions of Turkey, have tried to bind the hand of Turkey on the fourth side.
At the point of today, serious doubts and evidence that the FETO is behind critical events such as the murder of Hrant Dink, the Uludere incident, the crash of the Russian aircraft began to appear.
The tribe is great.
During the July 15 coup attempt, the record of FETO General Gökhan Shahin Sönmezateş, who managed President Tayyip Erdoğan's hotel in Marmaris and the murder operation, appeared to be very bullshit.
It was previously stated that Sönmezateş was informing the terrorists of the air operations to be made to the PKK while the aircraft were flying.
In the investigation by the intelligence units, it was also found that the record of Gökhan Sönmezateş was bubble.
Protecting the terrorists
In addition to the disclosure of intelligence to the PKK, it was also announced that Turkish war aircraft did not hit the target specifically.
The point given by MIT in the Kandil edges concerning the leadership of the terrorist organization PKK, the intelligence was claimed to be distorted by Gökhan Sönmezateş and prevented the shooting of targets.
With the coordinates changed, it was determined that aircraft flying to destroy the lead staff of the PKK, hit the places on the side of the targets, and the leaders of the terrorist organization were thus disappeared.
In the intelligence examination, it was revealed that Sönmezateş played a key role in both the distraction of targets and the flight of the F-16 terrorists from the place where they were.
37 thousand officers are opened.
At the instructions of the terrorist head Fetullah Gülen, the rebuilding process was started in the TSK and the Ministry of National Defense after the FETO members' attempt to break down.
Specifically when it was realized that the entrance questions to military high schools were stolen by the FETÖ, and that military students who were not members of the organization were sent out of the schools, a comprehensive cleaning process was launched.
With the latest exports, about 37 thousand officers remains from 39 thousand 287 officers, while the cleaning for generals and admirals will also be carried out for these officers.
For this purpose, the advances will be frozen in the staff, especially from the officers to the officer's rank.
A comprehensive investigation will be completed before the expansion.
The archives of 37 thousand officers began to be opened individually.
Thirty-four soldiers will be identified.
Officers who do not have any relationship with FETO will continue their tasks.
While the struggle will continue until the last FETO cleansed from the army, the promotion of the officers will only be scheduled after the investigation.
The investigation is conducted by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board.
In the framework of the investigation, the officers who opened the file are investigated whether they received rankings from civilians or by completing the Harp school, the awards they received, the places and commands they perform.
In addition, it will also be investigated whether they are a member of the FETÖ or not with a four-year-old investigation.
All measures will be taken to ensure that officials who do not have any connection with the FETO are not affected negatively by the process.
If the least doubt is found, the officer will be immediately disclosed and sent to court.
Relationships with those who have the right to knowledge and documents with the army will be immediately interrupted.
While all of these processes are frozen, the examination will be deepened.
There will also be necessary measures to ensure that there is no vacancy in the aftermath.

Turkey: Turkey to be poisoned
MHP's founder and first general chairman, Deputy Commissioner Tahsin Pehlivanoğlu, retired from the protections of Alparslan Turkeş, suggested that Turkeş was murdered by poisoning and that one of the family did this in cooperation with FETÖ.
From 1977, until his death in 1997, Pehlivanoğlu, who was at every moment next to Turkeş, said, "I have not told anyone until now, but I have to talk after watching the picture of that soldier spotting pieces from the helicopter of Muhsin Yazıcıoğlu and seeing that the same soldier is among the rebels sent to kill our President."
This is what Turkey says:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We made a check-up three days before arriving.

I think one of my family is poisoned in Amassia.
There was no autopsy in Turkey.
His former wife, Seval Turkeş, will have heard my discomfort and my words that he went out and made statements that went to the defense of "Turkeş was killed".
Man builds the tomb, man builds the tomb, man builds the tomb.
He had a heart attack.
The Turkish tomb must be reopened.
Is Alparslan Turkish killed?

Security official Jose Carumba also said in a statement to the local press that the guard was shooting the prisoners after he heard the gun voice and that a hand bomb exploded around.
Curumba noted that the authorities were investigating how the prisoners who shot the guards put the weapon into prison.
Explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
Officials said three people were killed in the explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, and 35 were injured, including tourists.
Police spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang said at a press conference that the bombing attacks were not related to terrorism.
Phingmuang, "Thailand has no regional or religious problems with anyone."
“We think this is an internal sabotage action,” he said.
Cunta leader Prayut Chan-oça also told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
He said, “We must focus on peace, peace and confidence.”
Last year, on August 17, a bomb attack near the Erawan temple in the capital, Bangkok, in Rajprasong, killed 20 people and injured 120.
The "Sleeping Unlawful" will be executed with a toxic injection

Franklin is one of the best-handed murders in California history.
Franklin, who was convicted of intentionally killing 10 people and attempting to kill one, was sentenced to death by a toxic injection.
FETÖ in Macedonia
Macedonian Secretary of State Furkan Çako said the extension of the FETO in its countries was also legally revealed and they took steps to launch the necessary investigations.
Minister Çako reminds that the organization has its activities in Macedonia as well as in the media and business world, "All of this is known in the public."
Turks don’t give their children to FETÖ schools anymore.
We also call on our people to no longer send their children here.
"This building, which has previously been benefited by the hospitality and the crowd, is well known by the public," he said.
The sky will be the scene of meteor rain.
TÜBİTAK National Observatory researcher and professor of the Department of Astronomy and Space Sciences of the University of Istanbul, Dr. Hasan Esenoğlu, said in a statement to AA reporter, Perseid will reach the highest level of the night that connects Friday 12 August to Saturday 13 August.
Esenoğlu said that thousands of pieces were formed by the rain of the Perseid stone by breaking from the corner star called "Swift - tuttle" with the effect of the sun's rays and drawing, this situation would turn into a natural visual celebration.
Esenoğlu said the Perseid sky stone was first discovered in 1862, and since the 1990s it began to be seen again in the world.
Esenoğlu said that the rain of the Perseid skystone can be observed in the months of July and August, "We need to watch such a visual celebration from space, we need to care."
After all, this is a natural visual celebration.
“The universe will contribute to better understanding us.”
Red when it is cold, white when it is hot
Esenoğlu observed that some of the pieces broken during the rain stone would fall to the earth in the size of a mercury, continuing as follows:
Perseid temperatures can rise to 2,000 degrees Celsius.
Due to the warming and drilling in the atmosphere, Perseids produce light in red while cold in the natural environment, and white when hot.
It is possible to contribute to science by writing how many sky stones are seen on the website of the International Sky Organization.
These data are valuable because they are collected from all over the world.
It can be watched all night.
Esenoğlu reminds that the sky stone rains about 60 kilometers per second, saying that this visual celebration in the sky can be observed well throughout the night from places with little light in the northeastern direction.
Esenoğlu reports that more than 100 stone rain per year occurs, and after Perseid stone rain on December 4-17 Geminid stone rain is a natural event worth observing.
Less educated, former footballer Erdoğan
If this balance was broken, it was the winning alliance of the popularist Islamists led by the poor-educated former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and a widespread religious entrepreneur of Fetullah Gülen, who founded more than a thousand schools, dozens of universities and educational institutions from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is a translation of the phrase in an article published last week in Foreign Policy.
The university graduate Erdoğan's less educated and former footballer; the primary school graduate Gülen's horizon is described as a broad entrepreneur, these and similar articles in which Gülen's students are clearly praised are often included in the Western press.
After that, on the other hand, “Why is the US and/or Western opposition rising in Turkey?” in thematic articles, they are trying to bring an explanation with the sentences starting with ‘Why Erdogan...’.
It is possible to think that the analysts who see the Western opposition in Turkey as a neurotic situation that emerged during the period of Erdogan are a member of Turkey's history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first decade of the Erdogan period can be read as a period in which the Western opposition in Turkey decreases or remains in the average.
For the past decade, the EU and the United States have been in a synchronous and good relationship.
As a result of the massacre of the Assad regime in Syria, the EU cannot reveal a clear policy on the outbreak of the domestic war and the refugee crisis leaving Turkey alone, the European Parliament’s President Schulz, some figures in the form of “Erdogan is not our counterpart”, the opening of a curse competition to Erdogan in Britain, and this is the only thing that the then London mayor, the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the current Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Foreign
Let’s forget that as a result of the bloodshed, we lost our 247 people, that the EU countries, our so-called allies, and the U.S. did not have any support for our democracy until the failure of the coup was proved, that Kerry’s first reference spoke that they expected “peace and stability in Turkey” to be built, that they did not have any emphasis on democracy and the elected government.
So how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including Turkey, have participated in the protest march because 11 Charlie Hebdo workers were killed in Paris but 247 people who resisted the tanks for democracy were killed over a month after the coup attempt, although no president from any Western country that is "aligned" with Turkey has come?
What do we say about the presidents who come several times a year for the refugee issue or who send high-level representatives to send low-level representatives?
How will we evaluate that all EU and U.S. ambassadors go to their past visit because the window of the Hürriyet newspaper has been broken and do not take a visit to the bombed Great National Assembly of Turkey?
If it is remembered that when the coup occurred in Egypt in the first two weeks the EU sent a high-level representative with the coup leader Sisi, and Kerry praised the coup administration by saying 'democracy is rebuilt' in his visit after the coup, is it very abnormal that the Western countries who refused to support Turkey in the resistance of democracy say that they are worried about the democracy of Turkey at any occasion?
Nevertheless, even allowing Gülen to live freely in the United States, which 95% of the people see as responsible for the coup, is now enough to shout the Turkish people.
If the background I have counted above is added to it, I think it is clear that the rising West/American opposition is a situation that cannot be explained only by Erdogan.
Furthermore, Erdogan has not even stated that he believes that the U.S. is influenced by the coup.
That is, it was never a thief.
The Gezi wise men who see their own people small, who say “We are the teferruatt,” who humiliate the voters who don’t think like him as “the ignorants who throw their hearts,” can they do the same way after the night of July 15?
After seeing how this people have possessed the state and democracy, would they have sought the answer to the question "Where are we wrong?"
So many questions to be answered?
Officers who have served in various stages until yesterday and have been granted the right to use the weapons of the state, have accepted to enter the status of "Hain" at once and have requested refuge from foreign states.
We need to see how we live in a environment of mental disappointment and how people’s inclination leads people to behaviour that will describe them as disappointment.
When the brain is trying to break...
Were there any more perspective for those who participated in this action than comparing the cities of Turkey to the cities of Syria?
Why does an officer bomb the parliament of his own country?
We shouldn’t fall into a mistake like waiting for proper behavior from the flooded brains of the FETÖ.
Other people are responsible, but let’s know that the responsible of everything is not just FETÖ.
The personnel who offer politics as a profession of struggle, hatred and hatred have also made the necessary contribution to the tragedies that have occurred.
Even those who present themselves as "clear" have convinced the crowds that all kinds of irregular behavior and even ignorance are natural.
When we were given weapons to the hands of those who hate their own people, we even saw how they opened fire to this people.
The path of democracy, the path we know
I say a very simple thing: on the evening of July 15 in Turkey, the FETO’s soldiers in the Turkish army gave 250 martyrs to the tuffers, haramists, sergents and founded more than to save democracy.
But there are three periods behind 15 July: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and later.
There are three changes prepared in these three periods: economic, social, and political.
The social change prepared two major facts: the metropolitan migration from the rural area and the transfer of these migrants to the center after they were kept around the cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I said that the move was through the metro.
I also stressed that the Metro is the most important element of social change.
The second major change in the same direction is the bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The way comes, the economic and social structure changes.
So much has changed the political structure.
I have seen this history in Istanbul with the bridges thrown over the Boğaz since then.
Demirel built the Boğaz Bridge.
This was the threshold of the 1950s after the rural movement.
Özal continued the progress in the same direction with the second bridge which we now have changed its name to the 15th July Shetty Bridge.
Even their roads indicate the relationship established between the environment-center.
It is also a sign of how a social change path is followed.
Demirel and Özal's purpose was to eradicate large masses in the center.
It is the ideology of the center.
The party has not built the third bridge for many years.
The movement was moving at all the speed.
People who arrived were placed in satellite cities.
A little closed system was created in that area.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people over, business, social status, and they also voted for the AK Party.
Thus the masses were asked not to eradicate in the center, but to gain their political consciousness in the surrounding area and to come to the center afterwards as themselves.
This formation was related to the party's pre-continuous discourse (1992-2002).
These discussions admitted to the crowds the obligation of the conservative, religious and religious people not to integrate with the center, but to stand side by side.
The AK Party, following the method I mentioned in 2002, activated the masses, joined politics, matured.
After this, now note, the democratic struggle on July 15 is simultaneous with the construction of the 3rd Bridge.
History and sociology are interconnected.
I would add another dimension to it: the movement of the AK Party, I’m talking about, is not limited only to the bridges of Istanbul.
More interesting thing happens: AK Party is now integrating the surrounding cities with the central cities.
This is done through two bridges.
The Osmangazi Bridge.
The two bridges of 1915 Canakkale.
Add the ways.
Turkey will now reach from Trakya to Izmir by another route.
Do you know what it means, Ismir will now be a different city.
Let’s say that the party does not get it from the inside, but it will get it from the outside.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, now Trakya cities will become other human and social geography.
So much so!
The 15th of July are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie in Fenerbahce
Fenerbahce continued the preparations for the Grasshoppers match with training in the morning.

The person who complained of the Holy Lightning to the Smile...
New developments are ongoing with the Shike Operation to Fenerbahce.
The journalist who participated in a program published in CNN Turk and who explained that this operation was carried out by FETÖ, Hussein Gülerce, "A name from the sport world has educated Fethullah Gülen the words of Aziz Yıldırım about himself."
"One day the lightning in the plane said this person in the form of 'What do you do with your Fethullah Gülen'.
And when he spoke to him, he spoke to him, and he spoke to him, and he spoke to him, and he spoke to him.
Why the Holy Lightning?
The president of the club, which is the most supportive of Turkey, is in this mind, with the idea that he can hurt him.
“The case was for the purification of the Holy Lightning,” he said.
After these words, a statement came from Faik Light, a major lawyer of the Shike case.
Light came to the opposite view program published in Habertürk and revealed the person who complained of St. Yıldırım to FETÖ leader Fethullah Gülen.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
The Holy Lightning says something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah Gülen.
Arriving in Azerbaijan on a private plane.
The Holy Lord is a joke man, and he speaks with dull words while criticizing someone.
The words may be somewhat winged.
Some can react to that phrase.
These phrases are grown somewhere.
The handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, the handwriting, and the handwriting.
What they say, they criticize heavily.
The only problem, of course, is not that.
At the same time, a football team is trying.
Some footballers and managers from the Galatasaray Club have direct contacts and Hakan Thanks...
Master: The subject is different.
The head of Trabzonspor, Muharrem Master, extended his hand of friendship to Fenerbahçe.
The Master said that the matter of Turkey is the matter of all clubs, "We are on the side of this country with 79 million."
We have to show a stunning position.
If Fenerbahçe has a problem with FETÖ, if injustice has been done, I will stand behind Fenerbahçe.
“But the issue between Trabzonspor and Fenerbahçe is different.”
The victim prices have been revealed.
Karabulut said: "As a unity, we set the price of the kilogram of living sacrifice to 18 pounds."
“We also identified the price of the cow again the living kilogram of 17 lbs, the price of the living kilogram of the cow we put as second class as 15 lbs,” he said.
Karabulut, noting that the animals that will not be sacrificed last year were also sold, said what citizens should be careful when taking the victim:
It is especially important to pay attention to animals.
It is also important that the animal is healthy.
For this purpose, our citizens can check the vaccines in the passport of the animal while receiving the victim.
From the outer appearance, the victim must be alive and alive, he has thrown his hair on it.
There should be no signs on the face, such as sickness.
In recent years, we have seen animals that have not been sacrificed have also been offered and sold.
An animal must be 2 years old.
This can be seen by looking at the animal’s teeth.
A two-year-old animal’s teeth are covered.
But the animals that are younger than them have not had their teeth.
In the image, the animal may look big but the cover teeth may not come out.
The cover tooth is also noticed immediately because it is already bigger than others.
Rize Airport to be on the sea
The second airport to be built with sea filling in Turkey will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on a 266 hectare area between the Greşilköy Village and the Girl Tower, 26 to 32 meters away from the coast.

Here are the Galatasaray football players in Gülen's conversation.
It was revealed that Galatasarayli and national footballers, who shot their mark on Turkish football for a period, took part in the 1996 FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen's conversation.
In the picture that was taken in 1996, among the footballers who listen to the conversation of Fetullah Gülen, Hakan Ünsal, Mert Korkmaz, Okan Buruk, Arif Erdem, Ismail Demiriz, Uğur Tütüneker and Yusuf Tepekule is clearly clear.
In this conversation, Gülen used the expression of Galatasaray, "We scored 4 goals we won."
Said Alpsoy, known as FETÖ’s former football imam, also recently told the SABAH newspaper “Turkey in 2002 became the third in the world when the prize was distributed to the team.”
The Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, and the Lord.
The total amount was $250,000 or $500,000.
The money was brought to Pennsylvania by Arif Erdem.
He laughed, and he later made the words to Arif.
The national football players have joined the conversation of Gülen!

This is a very interesting statement from Robert Amsterdam.
Robert Amsterdam, an official of the Amsterdam&Partners law firm, which has legally investigated the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETO), has received an article to the US magazine Forbes, sharing information about how the FETO is organized.
FETÖ leader Fetullah Gülen said that he manages the organization from his ownership in Pennsylvania, and said that Gülen "when he closely looks at how he operates approximately 150 contractual (charter) schools in the U.S., it will be quite clear that the organization has a secret and advanced organizational capacity underground."
Amsterdam said seven months ago that Turkey was commissioned to investigate Gülen-related companies and schools, stressing that what they found so far was "shocking".
Amsterdam said in his article:
According to the information provided by the firefighters, the Gülen organization has a rigorous hierarchy in which the instructions are transmitted.
These instructions are usually transmitted in face-to-face meetings in Gülen and Poconos.
There is a group of seven men on the mountain.
This group sends the instructions to the consulting committee.
The instructions go from here accordingly to the regional imam, the country imam, the country imam, the province imam, the province imam, the neighboring imam, the student house imam (light houses) and the students.
Businessmen, bureaucrates and officials work at different levels depending on their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam, which has the largest contractual school network in the United States, reports that the organization has 55,000 jobs worldwide, and it has the largest contractual school network in the United States, reports that millions of dollars are paid to these schools each year from the taxes paid by American contractors.
Amsterdam wrote that the majority of these funds were directed among the members of the organization and transferred to the “selected” taxpayer companies.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
The Magnolia school founded in California was captured while giving $700,000 for a yearly service contract to the company with which Gülen is affiliated and shared the same office.
Amsterdam also showed the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that the school also paid an additional $3.1 million to the owner, and in the audits it was found that the school and the owner’s management were made up of the same persons associated with Gülen.
Amsterdam, taking into account similar situations in the Harmony schools with 46 branches, which hold the largest place in the Gülen network, said that smaller companies associated with FETÖ were paid money with pensals such as software license, programming.
Amsterdam, pointing out that what is done within the FETO enrichs one another, "These examples I give show that about $28 million of American taxpayers are abused."
"In addition, this is the apparent part of what we have found so far," he said.
Amsterdam, pointing out that so far nothing has been done to prevent such events, reminded that the situation has worsened over the past period and that the Texas Education Office has begun to investigate the irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools seem to work normally and that many employees don’t know what kind of corruption it is.
Amsterdam, "But in fact these schools work like a snow machine for Smile."
"Gülen then uses its huge amounts of money for political donations in order to hide its illegal activities," he said.
According to a former American teacher who worked in these schools, some employees in the Gülen schools held meetings separately and transferred a certain part of their salaries to the organization, Amsterdam said, "It is believed that Gülen members in the Turkish Armed Forces also work in the same process."
The coup provokers have strengthened their positions over the years.
"But apparently the army was gathering power behind the scene while working normally," he wrote.
Amsterdam concluded its article as follows:
Political makers in the U.S. have signs of interest in the minds of 15-16 July and after events, and this is something expected.
But while dealing with the two allies’ situation at a diplomatic level, individuals in government authorities need to be awake that the U.S. laws were seriously violated in Gülen’s operations.

Hakan Shakur and his father's 200 million assets were captured
The Prosecutor General of the Republic of Sakarya, in the framework of the FETÖ investigation, sentenced Hakan Şükür and his father, Selmet Şükür, who contracts in Sakarya.
Hakan Şükür, located in the United States, and his father, Selmet Şükür, were searched for Adapazari and the houses in Istanbul.
Through the searches he was not found.
The police took action on the announcement that Selmet Şükür was in Friday prayer in the Salko Camii located in Adapazarı Sakarya Street.
The members of the church were waiting for the Friday prayer.
After the prayer ended, Salmet, when he saw the police, lifted his hands into the air.
He was arrested and sent to the police's safety department.
Gökhan Shükür then followed his father's team car with his car and went ahead of the Security Directorate.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic of Sakarya, Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür said they provided financial support to the FETÖ.
The Nöbetçi Sulh Criminal Court, which examines the application of the Prosecutor's Office, has decided to take away the non-movement of Hakan Şükür and his father Selmet Şükür, on land transport vehicles, bank or other financial institutions accounts, real or legal persons, all kinds of rights and receipts, the valuable documents in their gifts, the partnership shares in companies, the real estate cash and other asset values.

The third-class security director Ahmet Duran Bitmez, in charge of the Batman Provincial Security Directorate, was revealed in the framework of the investigation of the FETÖ's attempt to hit.

Security forces suspect Bitmez has fled to the north of Iraq to join the terrorist group PKK.
Beware of children’s habits.
Dr. Bilgin Giray of the Faculty of Dental Medicine said that they relaxed with this reflection by making it a need to empty because children were unable to do the break in the early age.
Dr. Giray, who ranked the reasons for the appearance of the finger absorption habit in children, said, "Finger absorption is a occurrence from birth to 3-4 years of age."
Most babies have their fingers.
The child who emits his finger to satisfy the need to absorb in childhood after 1-1,5 years of age emits his finger to solve the breast desire and relax.
“To get tired of yourself, when it comes to sleep, when it is anxious, and when it leaves the mother, it can be in the finger absorption behavior.”
On the basis of the finger absorption behavior seen in advanced ages, the insufficiency in the mother-child relationship and the feeling of confidence in the child are not sufficiently developed, Dr. Bilgin Giray said the effects of this behavior on the health of the teeth with the following words:
The finger absorption behavior has a negative effect on the formation of the child’s dental structure.
As a result of the pressure that occurs during breastfeeding, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the lower teeth are pushed back.
This also leads to the positioning of the lower neck behind, distorting the balance of the spine and the structure of the tooth.
The physiological reflection of this occurs in the form of speech disorder and the closure of it looks aesthetically bad.
In the age of 6-7 when permanent teeth begin to come out if no early solution is found, Dr. Giray, who notes that a much more complex treatment process can occur, "we can protect our children from closure and joint problems without the development of the chest completed."
“Therefore, today, children’s eye and hearing controls need to keep their mouth structure under control,” he said.
New breath in the treatment of close vision: Trifocal lens
Patients after cataract treatment do not naturally want to wear glasses.
Multi-focused patterns have been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
Three-focal remedies that have been used in recent periods have taken a step further the success of treatment in this area.
The difference between triphocal lenses and other spots is the ability to provide a clear view not only of the distance or close distance, but also of the distances defined as the interdistance.
Treatment of distant, close or intermediate vision disorders
Intermediate distance in vision disorders represents a point we use very often in our daily lives.
For example, the indicator panels of the cars are the portable computers we hold in our arm or the distance intervals we define as 60-70 cm long.
Through the correction of the intermediate distances of the triphocal lenses, our patients do not need to wear glasses in any way, regardless of whether they are close or far.
Another advantage of triphocal spots is that they also reduce night complaints.
Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç, Eye Diseases Specialist, said: “There is no difference between the triphocal lens treatment applied for each distance vision treatment and the normal cataract treatment.”
Our patients with triphocal treatment can easily get eye health with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes.
And the next day our patients can return to normal life.
It is a operation that improves the quality of life especially for people who drive cars, who have too much computer use, who love reading and who live a more active life.
You can also consult an eye doctor to find out if this procedure, which can be applied to any patient over the age of 18, is suitable for you.
It is not used for heart surgery.
Varis is a disease that has increased its frequency in recent years.
In the vary where genetic proximity is the primary factor; long hours of work, work with the obligation to stand for a long time and long-term sitting causes an increase in varicose complaints.
Is it used for heart surgery?
I have a vary, what do I do if I have a heart attack in the future? such questions are often asked by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of collardamar system on the leg:
There is a deep adhesive system that we call the main pathway that carries dirty blood to the lungs and gathers the main dirty blood of the leg.
These are called deep femoral veins and surface femoral veins.
Problems in these bulbs are more rare, the vessels cannot be closed in their diseases, and medication treatments are applied to keep these vessels open.
There is a superficial vascular system called the side path that carries dirty blood to the lungs and combines with the deep vascular system in the cartilage.
This system consists of two large and two small safen venas, which we call.
In four of these vessels, insufficiency and varices may develop.
The balls that can be used in heart surgery are the surface balls called the large safen venus.
The absence of these vessels has no harm to the body and therefore can be used in heart surgery.
However, so that these vessels can be used in heart surgery, the vessels must be healthy.
The heart is a very important organ.
The process of taking varicose veins by surgery or leaving them in place by laser reduces the workload of the deep glands and makes the leg healthier.
A false belief among the people is that even varicose veins can be used as a replacement.
The varicose veins are never and never used in heart surgery!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
The replacement vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located under the chest, around the stomach and on the arm.
Therefore, it is irrelevant to wait for the varicose vein to be used for the heart and worry about it.

A meaningful message from the Uzbek Super Cup
Galatasaray Sports Club Chairman Dursun Özbek has published a statement before the Super Cup Finals that will be played between Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.
Here are the words that Dursun Özbek attracted attention to the unity and cohesion in Turkish football:
The two roots and two favorite clubs of the Turkish sport, Galatasaray and Beşiktaş, will meet for the Super Cup on Saturday night, 13 August, at Konya Metropolitan Torku Arena.
This match was neither the first nor the last match in the competition that left a century behind the two rounds of our club.
But a very vital meeting as a timing.
As we all know, our country, on July 15th night, passed over a big badge.
The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terror Organization/Parallel State Building (FETÖ/PDY), which intended our democracy, was overcome thanks to the unity and cohesion of all sections of society.
That night we paid a lot of money.
We gave witnesses.
We have a lot of gas.
This painful price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of the rule of peace, not of struggle in these lands.
That night the representatives of the Turkish sport also opposed the coup with a single voice, with a single heart; they all stood alongside democracy.
In these critical days, we need more than ever the unifying characteristic of the sport.
I hope that this match, which coincides with the 2nd anniversary of the death of our dear rival, President Suleyman Seba, and the new football season that takes the name of our club's legendary captain Turgay Sheren, will be the beginning of the match of love and peace in the Turkish sport.
I hope the winner will be our country and the Turkish sport, no matter what the score will be at the end of the match before the tribunes that will be shared by the fans of Galatasaray and Beşiktaş.

Hoy's retirement also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Scot has already seen the potential he has already achieved, and the British coaches have not given up Skinner.
Four years ago, the champions with Hoy, Hindes, Kenny and Skinner broke the Olympic record in the ranking round, but in the first round, New Zealand re-established this record.
And the British triangle went to the duel for gold.
Although Hindes was somewhat behind in his tour, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stood on it.
A large part of the transformation that allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace using a larger tool to slow himself was this strategy change.
Hoy, as BBC’s expert commentator, watched them out of the spot, and when they came out on the podium, he was stuck in the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes.
Glasgowlu, the 23-year-old Skinner said, “This is an honorable comparison.”
I am here just to do my best and to announce my name.
In the final we broke the Olympic record and defeated the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
Hindes acknowledged that after winning with Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, he was deliberately dropped on the track after a bad start.
He then reacted to this comment and there was no way to demand from the rivals of Britain.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
He said, “With all the British flags on the stand, we were like London.”
A team founded three months ago.
We’ve lost a lot of world races so it’s a really incredible feeling to win at the Olympics again.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation winning seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress we have shown in the last five months, we are waiting for another five days to succeed on the race track.
Kenny’s attitude shows that Hoy’s dream of repeating three gold winning records in one Olympics is not so impossible.
This will also mean that Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and he himself was born on March 23 (as well as the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, is a sacred history of the British sports past) will six gold medals and a silver medal.
This is the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will then go to the sprint race; the race starts today and will last three days.
The 28-year-old Boltonlu said, “I’m just enjoying it for now.
Team activities are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
He said, “If he wins another two gold medals, he must be awarded the Knight title.”
Although this is just the event of today’s medal, there is a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished the ranking first in the four-mile team race.
The track was completed at 3:51.943 hours.
The world record was set by the 2012 London Golden Medal winner at 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in today's second part and Wiggins will attract all the attention.
Yesterday, before the ranking tour, the authorities called him to measure his height while there was a dispute with the officials.
In the relevant women’s event that will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavie’s Katie Archibald reached the world record for 4:13.260.
The Great Britain team relies on a powerful bicycle team to deal with scores in the middle of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
After the great overwhelming demonstrations in Beijing and London, the expectations in Rio have been significantly reduced.
In the background, there have been many bad developments, including the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April due to sexuality and harassment accusations and the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But the first night after the races on the track shows that Britain’s astonishing reputation for finishing in the perfect time can be re-proved this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the future of Portland is suspected
The future of the Portland aluminum foil in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers went into uncertainty after one of the facility owners announced the termination of a supply contract that would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts by the energy company that supplies the facility.
This move arose after the decision of the Victoria government in early this year to not overcome the subsidies to keep the facility operating.
The duration of the 20 year fixed subsidy expires in November.
The work at Alcoa’s Portland facility may be at risk by 2000.
Any closing process can cause up to 2000 jobs to be directly or indirectly at risk.
And as the slurry wire consumes approximately 10 percent of the entire electricity of Victoria, additional chaining effects may also occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the reservoir, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland is losing money and facing the risk of closure.
These developments originally arose after the strengthening of the Australian dollar and a few years of speculation on the future of the facility based on the facility’s consumption fee.
AGL, which supplies energy from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum power plant, said the other three owners are expecting to take action in the direction of terminating their contracts.
A large majority of the facility belongs to Alcoa and Alumina’s joint venture and China’s CITIC and Japan’s Marubeni Corp have smaller shares.
“AGL is waiting for the Portland facility to continue to work, which means the physical demand for electricity will continue,” he said.
AGL stated that the contracts should enter into force from November 2016.
Since the contracts are a 12-month termination period, they will be completed in 2017.
Energy company said, "Therefore, AGL will continue to expect contracts to contribute to the financial year 2017.
The effects that AGL may be exposed to potential gains in the 2018 financial year and subsequent, in the current situation, are limited to the adoption of a strong long-term contract position for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says the value of its contracts on its accounts has already dropped to $187 million due to the "premise of the deadline".
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate or supply electricity to the reservoir."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which had to enter into force in November this year but has not yet explained why it did not withdraw from the contract.
Analysts are opposed to the possibility of closure of both the Portland basin in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to economic trouble in the sector.
Stephen Mikkels, the operations manager of AGL, who responded to analysts earlier this week, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy each year.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, the demand in the [electric] market will result in a remarkable decline.
And as a producer, this will not be a good development for us.”
Not just the star of the Kardashian TV show; Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September number
Kendall Jenner, the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner group of model and managing mother Kris (20), is covered by the US Vogue’s highly anticipated September number.
Kendall, a brand ambassador to Estee Lauder and showcasing in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced this on Thursday on his Instagram account.
Kendall wrote, “When I looked at this cover in a room full of people I loved, I was crying.”
After the cover was revealed, a strange reality video (or just the Keeping Up with the Kardashians program), in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Caitlyn, who had trouble in the bar and the uncle of everyone’s favorite show world, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest), was released; the family, who forgot the cover of their sisters in the video, was then preparing a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is a clip story line of almost all children's TV shows' "birthday" episodes (Seacrest says "Do you think we've forgotten you?" with the intimity of a cartoon rabbit at 8 a.m.), Kris should somehow include the other girls in this presentation.
With this development in Vogue’s September number, we are sure to enter a new Kardashian period.
Kendall's sister Kim may have passed her on getting out to the Vogue cover (the cover was shared with her wife Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is a success on its own.
Vogue’s September number became the most sold number of the year.
With its thickness much like a coffee table book from a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of the last year’s 832-page skin contained advertising content).
The revelation of the cover star is also a process that is closely followed; for the past two years, the photographs of the magazine are scattered before the official announcement.
Previously covered women include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been placed a lot of "model celebrity" from "famous models".
The Oscar-winning Dior Ambassador, Jennifer Lawrence, appeared in the cover in 2013, and the next year the honor was awarded to Lady Gaga.
But even if Mrs. Jenner, defined by the magazine as the "glowing model" of the generation, is included in the previous category, it can be said that the environment is quite good.
These celebrities are not the relatives of famous people or reality show stars or the young people of today who know how to take a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
All of these are women who are legally skilled, leading in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, on the cover of last year, spent one of the best times of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is satisfied with Jenner's success.
Due to the reality show history, Jenner’s position in the fashion world will always be annoying.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid and named them "the glorious of time".
When the news revealed that Jenner would be on the cover of Vogue, this thought came to the face again.
But focusing on dissatisfaction seems unsatisfactory.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September Number.
He is a supermodel in the word.
He is coming to Marc Jacobs.
You are interested in Estee Lauder.
He himself, along with his sisters, sells his own pictures in the wall-paying applications for you.
The photographs of Cindy Crawford’s daughter are sold to the LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, maybe just his brother Kourtney and his children are on the reality show on TV to see.
Social legal support centers reject 160,000 people each year
While the sector is preparing for the impact that will result in more financial cuts in the operations that are currently challenged, more than 160,000 people from the most unprotected part of the nation are being removed from social legal support centers.
Three out of five people in Queensland (mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who have no resources to fight against unfair evacuation decisions, etc.) are rejected while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have consumed their opportunities, are preparing for more cuts.
From June next year, these legal support centers are planned to be deprived of more than 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrel, director of the Queensland Social Legal Support Centers, that the National Association of Social Legal Support Centers’ latest counting report found that thousands of people were withdrawn each year.
Mr Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government's decision was not revoked.
He said, “Queensland’s social legal support centers receive chronically insufficient financial support, which means that thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need.”
People who are in violent relationships, who struggle with the power of governance and the forces that break the back, the families in the process of separation and the workers who are unfairly dismissed... All of them are faced with problems of legal dimensions and cannot get the help they need according to this report.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will be forced to deal with more complex legal problems without seeking assistance.
We call on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to immediately recover these financing cuts in order for people to get the support they need when they face a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its promise to raise legal support to the national average.
Now we have to look at the social legal support centers and the communities they serve and the investment that the Palaszczuk government will do in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign team was charged after staff claimed to take gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was charged with accusation that he did not take any action after the North Carolina Operations Director told a staff that he took a gun while traveling with a chip in February.
The case was revealed in the case opened on Wednesday by former software trainer in the state campaign team Vincent Bordini in the state court.
Bordini said he was waiting for months to take care of the situation from inside but later realized that "this will not be".
According to Bordini's complaint, Director, Earl Philip, "he pulled out a weapon, put his right sign finger on the thumb and held the thumb towards Vincent's knee cover."
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that at least four more people had the same experience with Phillip after complaining to the local and regional campaign team leaders.
In his complaint, he said, “There is no need to be shot to damage the weapons.”
The case was opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate raised the crowd in North Carolina, saying that the "Second Constitutional Change People" (as it appears to be weapons owners and arms supporters) could take action if the rival Hillary Clinton was elected and elected his own judges.
Trump’s campaign team said the media assessed these statements outside the context and that he did not support violence.
Bordini, with his complaint, asks for compensation from the campaign team for lack of supervision and from Phillip for attack, blow and mental damage.
Trump’s spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not quickly return to the message he wanted to comment.
The efforts to reach Phillip remained unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news company in Charlotte, that Phillip recently left the campaign.
The call to its own consulting company Innovative Consulting Services has not been made a quick return.
Republican president candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial campaign.

The “Fet” line.
After President Erdoğan's call for FETO's "all can't know the intelligence, security can't know, report," MIT and Security established the FETO's news line.

You need to inform the prosecutors.
This is a patriotic debt.
“Everyone may not know the intelligence, security may not know, or they may not reach, the men are escaping,” he said.
In the framework of the work, the Ministry of the Interior, the General Directorate of Security and the National Intelligence Agency (MIT) launched an online reporting application.

www.egm.gov.tr/pages/hbar, www.mit.gov.tr/subscribe links will keep the information of the persons to notify the form provided to the service.
Those who wish to apply the information submitted by the Security General Directorate will also be able to add the document.
He will be returned to him if he wishes.
The citizen will also be able to make this information to the Republican Prosecutors in the provinces and districts where they can be notified by telephone to the 155 Police Imdat line.

Review of the Asset Fund discussed again in the Commission
The Turkish Asset Fund, which is expected to enter among the world’s largest funds, has been removed from the law on the protest.
It was decided to be discussed again due to the lack of the audit mechanism, but it was discussed again in the commission without any changes.
AKP brought the Turkish Asset Fund law proposal to sozcu.com.tr, CHP Member and Planning and Budget Commissioner Utku Çakırözer said, "We strongly oppose that the obligation to be taken from the assets of the public, the workers, the pension cuts, the unemployment fund gathered for the unemployed, this structure will be kept outside the Constitutional audit mechanisms."
The proposal of the Turkish Asset Fund law prepared by the government in order to provide long-term resources for investments and projects, with the opposition’s opinion that it should also be discussed on Tuesday, the bag was removed from the law.
But the AKP today brought the proposal back to the Planning and Budget Committee in the same way.
TBMM Planning and Budget Committee’s CHP member, Eskişehir Parliamentary Deputy Utku Çakırözer, told sozcu.com.tr the concerns and concerns of the CHP regarding the Asset Fund Law proposal.
Chakırözer, "When the creation of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the package bill draft, our former finance minister Zekeriya Temizel, head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, proposed that the package be removed from the law and also discussed in detail."
The government, which accepted this opinion, also rejected the draft.
The proposal came back to the committee yesterday.
“The government seems insistent to remove it from the parliament within a week.”
The Asset Fund said that there should be an agreement on the issue of the law, "Our greatest concern in this proposal of law is irregularity."
“The assets belonging to the public, the obligation to be taken from the worker, the retirement cuts, the income to be made up of the unemployment fund gathered for the unemployed, the income to be obtained without privatization, are irregularly transferred to a structure outside the control of the parliament and the council and without any responsibility,” he said.
Russia, China and the Gulf countries where such funds were established had oil revenues and trade excesses, and the fund was financed in this way, "But we have a savings gap."
The funds will be made up of public resources, the money of the people.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund is planned to be transferred from the individual pension fund, 100 billion for workers, and 50 billion for non-privatization.
“It means that this fund, which will be formed completely by the people’s money, must necessarily be under public control and this money should not be spent irresponsibly.”
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania, it is unacceptable to keep a fund out of parliamentary supervision where the resources of the state are collected and the assets of the state are guaranteed in its debt, and its concerns and concerns regarding the proposal of the Act on the Asset Fund are explained as follows:
The collection, expenditure, business and transactions relating to the debt of such a large public asset cannot be carried out only under the supervision of independent audit companies.
It also requires public control and a transparent structure.
In the proposal of law, there are no provisions on the control and transparency of the Asset Fund by the Constitutional Institutions.
There is no limit on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will ask about how this fund is used.
The purpose of the fund is to justify the financing of large projects.
There is no need to create an uncontrolled fund outside of the budget.
Why don’t you get in the budget?
When this happens, the intellectuals naturally come to the question, "Why does the council and parliament escape from the control?"
The asset fund stated that they are not against the transfer of money to investments, but they are against the fact that it is done with non-transparent, non-recounting mechanisms, and continued: "A need for such a fund can be discussed."
But if the government insists on this, then we must ensure that the international standards in other countries where such investment funds are established apply in Turkey.
The control and responsibility mechanism must be established.
It must be established in a way that the citizen will be able to pay the account of his own money used until the next dollar.
Chakırözer, who strongly opposed the proposal of the Asset Fund to the Commission, said: "We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticism in Parliament, especially after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this bill, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticism.
We are against the irregular use of national assets, the transfer of them, the unresponsibility of those who use them and the absence of public control.
"The desired Asset Fund can only be useful if these concerns are solved."
The proposal for a law was undertaken to ensure an agreement between the AKP and the opposition.
“It is a sign of the trust we have in Turkey.
Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koç, speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, said: "The investment of 30 billion TL that we have made in the last 5 years is an indicator of the confidence we hear in the future of our country."
Koç Holding Board Vice President and Ford Automotive Board Chairman Ali Koç and the manager of a number of foreign-capital companies met at the meeting on the topic "Those who trust Turkey, who produce in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
Ali Koç, who spoke at the meeting, said: "Our belief and confidence in our country, together with our partners, is not just promised, we fill it with our investments and actions."
The investment of 30 billion TL that we have made in the last 5 years is an indicator of the confidence we hear in the future of our country.
It is a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy at international standards, a qualified labor and an ecosystem that promotes R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and added value.
In the past few years, our government has offered our industries the most comprehensive incentives in our Republic history.
“I believe that with these incentives and comprehensive strategies we need a new ‘Investment Movement’ has been used.
President and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey, Hussein Gelis, said, “No event is now the problem of a single country, but we know that as global players.”
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are together and together, our problems will be resolved.
We could bring those that were not in Turkey 160 years ago.
We will continue to be in this area in Turkey.
“We’re going to build factory, but our horizons in this area should be open,” he said.
The President of Shell, Ahmet Erdem, said that Turkey is one of the top 10 countries for Shell.
We believe in the future and potential of Turkey.
We have invested in many areas, including energy, and we continue to do it.
We thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their supporting international investors.
This is a trustworthy job for international investors.
“This will increase our country’s competitiveness.”
Dr. Altan Demirdere, President of Sandoz/Novartis Turkey and the Middle East Region, said: “On August 10, our Global CEO would come to Turkey.”
The trip was delayed.
We also opposed it.
The arrival of the CEO was very important.
They wanted a gunless car, as well as protection.
When I came here, I saw everything was normal.
He left his guard and car and happily returned to his country.
Investing in a country is like marriage.
First of all, if everything goes well, you’ll get married and get married by making a long-term plan.
We are married and have no intention of divorce.
He returned from the threshold.

The Turkish Prime Minister Yıldırım said that the industry is the industry sector that will provide the comparative superiority of Turkey, "We should not miss the process of transition to Industry 4.0 in the industry."
“If our land is a locomotive and we are concerned about achieving its 2023 goals, we need to think about the industrial revolution, the information and technology revolution, and that’s what we need to.”
In the evening of July 15, the Prime Minister Yıldırım added to his words that Turkey has returned from the edge of a big gap, "Those who mean the future of our country, those who try to destroy democracy, the humble who don't even fear to bomb our Gazi parliament, if they were muvaffak, we were talking about another Turkey today."
With the coup, the government was captured, the national will was eliminated and the world fell from the League of developing countries, we would talk about a Turkey among the 3rd world countries.
"Thanks to God, we have defeated this problem with the resistance of our people, our Chief Commander, our President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and the determination of our government," he said.
The Prime Minister Yıldırım continued his words: "We will quickly get out of the impact of this incident and look forward."
Living with a constant blow is never and never true.
We have very ambitious goals.
This attempt did not hit the Turkish economy.
The chaos and the crisis awaited again mistaken.
Today, our democracy and our economy are underway.
Our banking sector, our financial sector continues to work well.
In 2015, the foreign trade gap appears to have dropped by 25 percent.
The national income rate of the search gap was 5.8 per cent in 2014, while this rate fell to 4.5 per cent in 2015.
At the end of this year, we will be reduced to 4.
We will never change our strict position in public money.
Turkey’s 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have lowered the national income rate of the budget gap, which is above 11 per cent, to a level of 1.3 per cent in 2015, and we are trying to maintain these rates.
We are better in public debt than the EU, than many countries in the world.
Our banking financial sector continues to work on a solid ground.
"Our central bank, despite July 15th, did not need to exchange the market and there was no reduction in our reserves, we have a gross reserves of over $121 billion," he said.
The development of the economy, the increase in production and the formation of new employment areas will provide all kinds of facilities, the Prime Minister Yıldırım said, "We are also making comprehensive arrangements to save you from your last burden."
We have implemented many regulations, continuing to pass through, until the excess of cash and unpaid tax debt is re-facilitated and taxed.
“You continue to produce for your country, continue to trust your country, and your government will continue to lift the barriers before you one by one.”
Hakan's father was taken to hospital from high sugar.
The father of Hakan Şükür, who was arrested in the framework of the operation against the FETÖ/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya, Sermet Şükür, was taken to the hospital as a result of the increase in sugar during the investigation.
In the framework of the operation launched against the terrorist organization FETÖ/PDY after the July 15 coup attempt by Sakarya Republic's Prosecutor General, former national footballer Hakan Şükür and his father Sermet Şükür were arrested yesterday evening.
The father of Hakan Şükür, who was arrested in Adapazari on Friday's prayer, was taken to the hospital while the question was ongoing.
The treatment of Sermet Şükür, who was taken to the hospital as a result of the increase in sugar, continues at Sakarya Education and Research Hospital.
Turkey is not leaving the West, it is not leaving the European Union.
Mehmet Şimşek: Turkey doesn't break from the West, it doesn't give up the European Union
Vice-President Mehmet Şimşek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci Istanbul Industry Chamber (ISO) attended the meeting on the topic "Those who trust Turkey, who produce in Turkey".
Scientific Industry and Technology Minister Faruk Özlü, who spoke at the meeting, said: "I think there were many good results from the developments that occurred in the night of July 15 and after that."
The most important of these, without a doubt, is the spirit of unity and solidarity that all Turkey now feels deeply.
The 15th July process showed how strong the economy of Turkey has dynamics and how society has internalized democracy.
“It is clear that in the economy and democracy and democracy, for a society that has reached this level, the future process will go better and faster.”
Turkey must be saved from this silence.
The Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci, who said they were difficult to tell the world about the July 15 coup attempt that came from Faruk Özlü, said that the government has declared that they are traveling in this regard.
Zeybekci also pointed to the interest reductions that the banks launched in recent period, "If 63.4% of the profit of the first five sides of my real sector goes to interest, we must leave all our business our power and we must focus on this business."
That’s why the president is back and speaks about it.
With the real sector, with the banking system, with the government, with the politics, with the unity and cohesion of the politics showed after the 15th July civil Turkish democracy revolution, Turkey must get rid of this trouble.
We are very pleased with the recent developments.
“I hope in the next period the banks start with the encouragement of our President’s monthly zero-percentage point nine, eight starts down like this competition as the economic management, and we will its sustainability, continuity,” he said.
“The green passport will be issued by our exporter.”
Nihat Zeybekci said, “We will not leave the country that we have not gone to the world under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave the door that we have not been stolen.”
We will not leave anyone we do not contact about increasing our trade.
"We will never and will never ignore this; while we run for the bird in the branch, we will not be one of the birds in hand."
Zeybekci also said that the exporters will be given a green passport in the future, "One of the latest decisions that his law came out, we have now completed its regulations in the Ministry of Economy; from our exporters, from the first figures, we will also give the preferred green passport that represents this country to our exporters of about 17 to 20 thousand, we will give the order of our exporters."
“Those who are in the state must be cleaned.”
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimshek, referring to the 15th July coup attempt and the afterwards announced OHAL, Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Shimshek, referring to the 'kabus' for the coup attempt, said, "But it has remained behind, now we need to look forward."
For two simple reasons, Shimshek said that it was declared OHAL, "Naturally those in this attempt must be cleaned from the state and the process is working; but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to not face this type of attempt again."
This is the climate necessary for these administrative reforms, the State of Extraordinary has been declared, and so far very serious structural reforms have been carried out.
“When we do all this, we have acted within democratic principles and the rule of law, and we will continue to do it.”
He stressed that life has returned to normal in many areas, not the smallest reason for concerns of companies and individuals not infected with the financing of terrorism.
“I think the foundations of the democracy of Turkey have been established, because when you look at the source of the problems in the near past, you will definitely see that this betrayal network is in the work.
“Therefore, the cleansing of this terrorist organization from the state, that this period is closed in Turkey, will strengthen the democracy of Turkey.”
The foundations of the economy are generally solid and they have returned to normal structural reform agenda without ever losing time, "Turkey has returned to its original agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
There are no structural reforms if we do not have, because populism and conservation are increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only and only prepare for the future by making reforms."
Finally, Shimshek emphasized that Turkey will not break from the West, "Turkey may sometimes be in disagreement with our Western allies, our friends; but Turkey does not break from the West, it does not give up from the European Union."
He jumped 25 meters to the sea and...
In Antalya, the 17-year-old Shamil Tayyar Flagmaker was hospitalized when he jumped to the sea from the 25 meters high valleys called 'Kartal Hill'.
Shamil Tayyar Flag, who swim with his friends on the Konyaaltı beach in the evening, then jumped fishing to the sea from the 25 meters high halls known as the "Kartal Hill" under the variant.
The professional swimmer, Shamil Tayyar Flagmaker, wounded his neck with the impact of the water.
The flagman, who had difficulty moving in the sea, was brought to the coast by his friends, who were again a professional swimmer.
According to the news, the health officials who arrived at the site of the incident, after the intervention, took Shamil Tayyar Bayrakçı with an ambulance to the Antalya Education and Research Hospital.
It was noted that the flagship was treated and there was no life danger.
A friend of the Flagman told the police, "When he jumped from the Carthage to fishing, his neck was injured."
“We couldn’t imagine that would happen.”
25 people killed in the newspaper

Two brothers killed in a gun attack.
In the two districts of ADIYAMAN, two brothers who were attacked by a car were killed.
The incident occurred in the evening on Mustafa Kemal Street.
The 39-year-old Ramazan Karahan's 02 KH 839 plate car, which was headed to the center of the province, was shot with a gun by an unidentified person.
The car led by Karahan, which lost control with the opened fire, stopped striking another vehicle.
At this time, the person who came to the car, Ramazan Karahan and his brother, Omer Karahan, 50 years old, shot after them.
Karahan brothers, while he was seriously injured, the attacker fled from the site by a motorcycle.
Police and health teams were sent to the scene.
The seriously injured Karahan brothers were taken to the Two State Hospital with an ambulance.
At the emergency service, Omar and Ramazan Karahan, who were treated, were not rescued despite all the efforts of the doctors.
While the bodies of the two brothers are placed for autopsy, the police, which investigate the mobese and security cameras in the area where the incident occurred, began the work to identify the escaping attacker and to get arrested.
Britain should channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renewal and well-being not only in our local communities and in London, but also across the country.
I think that all of these nations and regions will make Heathrow quite attractive, just as in London 2012, where we have made incredible efforts to benefit from the Games.
The Olympics gave great advantages to Stratford and East End.
And we will succeed again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave young people unemployed around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think the struggle to expand Heathrow is too challenging.
I was told that Britain would never be prepared for the Games and we would be ashamed to the whole world.
Those who doubted were wrong in 2012 and Heathrow will also see that they were wrong.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow responds to all the questions asked.
As at the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for not just a few people, but many.
Expansion leaves the opportunity to create 180,000 new and £211 billion economic growth and many skills and business opportunities both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, from T5 (the best airport terminal in the world has been selected for five years backwards) to T2, putting in place a timely and budget-friendly £11 billion infrastructure investment for the two most intense pistes in the world.
Now, we are ready to offer a third track supported by a private investment of £16 billion.
The 2012 London Games was a great success for the United Kingdom and I have no doubt that Heathrow’s expansion will be the same.
It is time for us to secure our business future by channeling this Olympic spirit to the expansion of Heathrow and to create many skills and business opportunities that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton, Heathrow Board Chairman and former Secretary of Commerce of the Treasury Ministry
Adblock Plus is “like a cat-mice game” about blocking Facebook advertising
For companies that make money from online advertising, the attempts to block the advertising blocking software for one of the companies that make the software looks like a "cats-mice game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block advertising blockers on the desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying its users could update their filters to block advertising on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would change the codes around the ads to make it difficult for advertisers to identify which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says it is now solving new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this advanced rebound between the community to block open-source ads and those trying to prevent them has lasted since the moment the block of advertising was invented," and it is possible for Facebook to produce its own solution in recent times.
The entrance of the world’s largest social media company into this struggle shows how big advertising blockers are causing concern for the industry.
Last year, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use advertising blockers, which is four times the number of people using such software in 2013.
With 1,03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenues.
According to a spokesman, mobile advertising blockers are pursuing advertising blockers on the desktop because Facebook’s mobile apps for social networks and Instagram are not effective.
Since Facebook considers that such a move is worth investing, desktop ads should still be able to provide enough income.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it will update the "advertising preferences" tool so that people can better control their ads.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters are worrying, and it will block some of the non-advertising content on the site.
A Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement, “These people don’t offer a good experience and we’re planning to take care of this problem.”
Advertising blockers are a blind tool, so we are focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to be able to give people control.
A woman ran into the highway in Switzerland; the incident looks like suicide
The victim was on the highway midnight.
Police are searching for people who witnessed the woman's crash of several cars on the highway early on Thursday.
The incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in Vaud canton immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police said in a statement that the woman was "unpleasantly" on the ground in the darkness of the night and that several cars hit her.
A 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He lost his life at the scene.
Police said some of the drivers involved were interviewed but some were not identified and asked them and everyone involved to appeal to them.
The lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that “a criminal proceedings have been opened as a ‘rational’ step to be taken in such cases.”
But it is not yet known whether the drivers involved in the incident will face any accusations.
Was it possible to avoid struggles?
This is what the prosecutor needs to identify,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases (both included a person out of the highway in the dark), the newspaper ruled that it was normal for the drivers not to wait for a boat to pass on the highway in the midnight.
Last year, one night in August 2014, a police officer was found innocent of causing his death due to negligence by hitting a man on the road near Paynerne at A1.
The court said the 22-year-old victim was drunk and fled on the road.
The court said the police officer, who was responding to an emergency call, used the vehicle reasonably and found a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Those who are aware of the incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
According to the new NASA climate model forecasts, Venus once had conditions suitable for life.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to what climate scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its warm, waterless surface and its atmosphere filled with CO2, was once home to similar conditions on Earth.
In the past, scientists were describing the low rotation rate of Venus with a thick atmospheric layer.
But the latest predictions suggest that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and may still turn slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the ancient Venus.
Although the planet has more dry areas than Earth, it may have once had sufficient water and protection against rapid evaporation with geographical variations.
The ancient Venus was also taking advantage of a 30 percent louder sun.
GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a newspapers: "In the simulation of the GISS model, the slow turn of Venus made it possible for the day to the sun for almost two months every time."
This also leads to rain, which forms thick cloud layers that move like a diamond that protects the surface from sun-based warming by warming the surface.
As a result, the average climate temperatures arise just a few degrees colder than the Earth today.
The model made it possible for Venus to create a story similar to the evolution that planet scientists previously suggested as a hypothesis.
Although Venus once had conditions suitable for life, it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over a few billion years.
The ocean was evaporated and the water steam was destroyed by burning with ultraviolet radiation.
The hydrogen was exhausted and behind it was a thick atmosphere full of carbon dioxide with only a deadly greenhouse gas effect; that is, as we know today, Venus.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy resigns from the Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Deputy Chairman of Colorado Avalanche Training and Hockey Operations, stating that the team was not promised in the decision-making process.
Colorado Executive Vice President/CEO Joe Sakic has confirmed this development and said the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
The 50-year-old Roy said in a statement, “In the past three years, I have fulfilled my tasks as head coach and vice president of hockey operations in Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination.”
Over the summer, I long thought about how I could improve further by giving this team the depth it needs and how I could get to a higher level.
To this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to speak in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions have not yet been fulfilled.
Sakic, who added Roy to the team on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakic said, “Patrick informed me today of his decision.”
He is grateful for everything he has done for our organization and we wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league in the first season of 2013-14 with Avalanche.
The club won 112 points and allowed the team to finish the league first, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the play-off period and missed the after-season games in both years.
Avalanche passed the goal of 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and received five points less than needed for the second joker area at the Western Conference.
Roy in the Honour List won four Stanley Cups, both for Montreal Canadiens and both for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers suspend strike and continue negotiations
The strike was suspended due to the wages of the North Sea oil workers and the chief negotiators began discussions for a new round of talks.
The strike against the oil field services company Wood Group is gradually carried out on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
In a joint statement, "We decided to re-start the process for the resolution of the existing dispute with the Wood Group and the Unite and the RMT unions," the statement said.
Within the next few weeks, we will hold a series of meetings that will take a whole day to adopt a new perspective on the problems from the beginning of the next week.
The workers’ unions said it was the first action in 25 years that this protest against salary cuts that could reach 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut payments to its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative pressure on the market.
After the company’s remuneration process, a 10% price reduction was applied to coastal contractors in 2014.
The company said additional cuts will provide the area needed to the company to pass through the difficult period in the market.
Shell has dismissed thousands of people while arranging their operations in the process of joining with British energy company BG Group and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, which is an economic situation that Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson will discuss one of the biggest workers’ disputes in the North Sea by meeting the workers’ leaders at the beginning of this week.
As he said, the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
In a statement, he said, “We need an effective economy for the North Sea and the whole country, not for the minority, but for the majority.”
Despite an average investment of about $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, it is expected to be less than $1.4 billion invested in new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler measured the return rate of the stars in the country's team star
The Kepler Space Telescope, with its latest mission, helped astronomers to create the most complete catalogue of the rotating speeds of the stars in the Earth's team star.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the team star turn variably quickly and how the conversion periods are related to the formation of the planet.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a newspapers: “When we compare our results with star sets, we hope to be able to learn more about the relationship between a star’s mass, age and even the history of the solar system.”
The star is 445 light years away from the Earth.
Most of the stars in the team were formed 125 million years ago and reach a new level of adulthood.
They return at the highest speed they can be throughout their lives.
At mountain rotation speeds, the stars in this stage of maturity form a large amount of star wind.
As these winds advance in the magnetic fields of the stars, they create a breakdown effect on the stars.
As a star ages, the return rate begins to decline.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of visible star spots like sunspots.
The latest rotating speeds catalog suggests that larger stars turn faster than small stars.
Rebull said the stars were similar to the dancers and the big ones made their turns on one foot more slowly than the small ones.
Rebull said, “We see those who turn slowly in the country’s balloon much heavier, and those who turn fastly are very light stars.”
Since the country's team is very close to the star, it sees it as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare its star characteristics with its rotation speeds.
Rebull said, “The country’s team provides theoretical models for star returns in both directions as young and old.”
There are more things that we want to learn about how, when and why the star’s return speeds fall, and why they leave their ‘dance shoes’ in a corner.
Rebull and colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the return rate of the country team star in three new articles that will be published in the Journal of Astronomy shortly.
