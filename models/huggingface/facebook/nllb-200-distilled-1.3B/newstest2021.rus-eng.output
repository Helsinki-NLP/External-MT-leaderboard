Semilyarski against prosecutors: Tartu ex-vice-mayor 's appeal will be considered on August 4
That means a decision on it will likely be made in early September.
The two first instance courts refused to hear Semilyarski's claim, but in April his cassation appeal was taken to the State Court.
The Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant on 12 December 2019, as its resolution did not fall within the competence of the administrative court.
The court's decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damage caused during criminal proceedings.
"These issues should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the district court", Anette Kreitsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State will have to have its say.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, juror Oliver Naees, his client was wrongfully accused of bribery for about two years.
Now he's demanding that the prosecution disprove the false allegations against him and pay him a moral judgment.
The reason for filing the complaint in court was the statements made by the special cases prosecutor of the Ljubljana District Prosecutor's Office Margus Gross in October 2017, when Semilarski along with another at the time vice-mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov was detained on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Remember that when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately held a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most powerful local government bodies, were corrupt.
This public suspicion that hung in the air followed me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been proven false, the prosecutor's office does not want to say anything about it", Semilyarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver N'yes, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework within which the prosecutor's office should operate.
"The allegations of bribery and corruption turned out to be false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and Lithuania that during the investigation stage, state officials must be careful in their choice of words so that suspects are not portrayed as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilyarski", said Naeas.
"The public presentation of Semilarski as a serious offender and a bribe-taker in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being established is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant", the lawyer added.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former vice mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be prosecuted on charges of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation in carrying out transactions of particularly large size.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city administration meetings in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level in non-working hours.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to step back from taking part in decision-making.
Earlier, as rus.err.ee reported, the prosecutor's office had indicated Semilarski was suspected of taking bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation in carrying out transactions of particularly large size.
This happened in October 2016 when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
The prosecutor's office and the security police said they had solid evidence against both deputy mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov's case later reached the court, which fully acquitted the politician.
The investigation into the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.
The former soloist of the band "Ruky Vyrch" visited the Tver region
The former soloist of the band "Ruky Vyrov", and now a solo artist, businessman and actor Sergey Zhukov posted a photo from the Tver region of Kalyazin on his official Instagram account.

Write in the comments what the weather is like in your city.
We have no rain today, but it is not yet above +20"..., Zhukov writes on social networks.
Probably, the singer is resting in a beautiful city of the Tver region with his family.
The residents of the region have already thanked the artist for his visit, and also expressed hope for a meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroska" mentioned in the post is probably a new version of an old song that Zhukov has recorded with blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
And most fans are still going for the old version: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
I want my support from the devoted fans of "Hands Up", "We Don't Need Another Baby".
Most people write directly that they like the original more than the original.

The clubs that are claiming the star of "Locomotive" Miranschuk, and his salary in Italy became known.
According to the "SE", at the moment, the A-series teams "Milan", "Laccio", "Fiorentina" and "Atalanta" are claiming the halfback of "Locomotive" Alexei Miransuk.
The 24-year-old would like to sign a four-year contract with a salary of at least €2 million a year plus bonuses.
Any club that makes that offer gets priority.
Locomotive is determined to sell their star and make a profit.
Otherwise, the club is going to have to spend a lot of money to renew the contract with the Haubek.
It should be noted that Milan is hoping to include left-back Diego Laxalt in the deal.
In the 2019/20 season, Miranschuk played 32 matches for the railroaders, scoring 16 goals and making 5 effective transfers.
Together with "Lokomotiv" the hawbek became the champion of Russia (2017/18), won the country's Cup three times (2014/15, 2016/17, 2018/19) and once the Super Cup of Russia (2019).
The United States has called on Qatar and its neighbors to end the dispute.
Qatar and other countries must restore trust and unity, says U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is harming regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the United States has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a settlement of the dispute, which Washington sees as "a threat to Iran's deterrence efforts".
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They've imposed a traffic blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said its neighbors were simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading the world in GDP per capita by a wide margin for several years.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and the largest exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How the central bank 's decision to lower key rates will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It dropped another 0.25 percentage point to 4.25% per annum - another historic low.
Judging by the return of the short step of rate reduction, as well as the tone of the Central Bank's statements and the updated forecasts for the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current monetary policy easing cycle may soon come to an end.
"We continued to soften monetary policy, first of all, given that there are still risks of inflation deviating below 4% in 2021", said Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and foreign demand.
According to Nabiullina, the recovery of the economy will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand recovered, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, annual rates of decrease in transport cargo turnover, industrial production slowed down.
According to the revised forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% (before this it was expected 4-6%), and the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The central bank had previously expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economy is becoming more optimistic, bringing us closer to the end of the easing cycle, say Russian and CIS economists Sofia Donets and Andrei Melashchenko.
The Bank of Russia has been consistently lowering the key rate for more than a year, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at its last meeting in June, the Central Bank cut it by one percentage point because of low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that was slowing due to the pandemic and its associated restrictions.
Chances of a monetary policy reset remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is close, agreed chief analyst of Rosbank Yevgeny Kochelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates a near pause in interest rate easing - disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require greater attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Kochelev points out.
One way or another, a cut in the key rate will lead to further cuts in rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly also for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the Bank "Oktyrtie" analytical department.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he said.
The interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, and the mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, economist Anton Pokatowicz of BKS Premier said.
Average deposit rates, he said, would also fall - to 4.2 to 4.5 percent in the coming months (just above 4.5 percent now).
They could fall further to 4%, if the Central Bank lowers the key rate in the autumn, according to Pokatović.
The centrist party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year .
This was stated in an interview with ERR by the General Secretary of the Centre Party, Mikhail Korb.
According to him, the total amount of payments that the party will have to make is about 300,000 euros.
"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party will settle its current debts and liabilities by the end of this year", said Korb.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Peasants' and Greens' Union again tops party rankings
The Union of Peasants and "Green" Lithuania, which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, topped the party rating.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the Vilmorus sociological research company on behalf of Lietuvos rytas newspaper.
After winning the 2016 parliamentary elections, the "peasants" lost the first place and for a long time led the main critic of Russia in Lithuania, the opposition "Union of the Fatherland - Christian Democrats (conservatives).
However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that the Peasants' and Greens' Union after the parliamentary elections this year will probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement caused outrage among conservatives.
The latest poll showed that if the parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for the peasants, and 17.2 percent for the conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Heydis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling class is no longer behind the conservatives.
According to Heydis, the "peasants"' sociological success was facilitated by the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulus Skvernelis.
This politician was first on the list of "peasants" in the 2016 elections.
The Social Democratic Party is in third place, with 7.1 percent of respondents now willing to vote for it.

The fourth is the Labor Party, led by Russian-born businessman Viktor Upasassky (6.2 percent).

Some of the 39 existing landfills in the area are being modernized into modern waste processing complexes.
But not every site is as good as it could be - many of them are overgrown with high density housing.
After the landfill is closed, it is put on recultivation - the landfill is covered with soil, degassing and infiltrate drainage systems are installed.
This stops the chemical processes inside the landfill from igniting, giving off a foul odor, or poisoning the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump is left to rise up a worthless pile in the middle of the surrounding housing development.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruse, where the Annino ski area was recently completed, authorities are considering converting the pile into a ski slope.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown beyond its designated land area.
So the reclamation had to buy back neighboring lots, which had been clogged with garbage for a long time.
"A while goes by, the site settles down, builds up strength, and we think about what we can do to make it useful.
It's a ski resort that you can see right in the eye", - said Nikolai Parfenov, the head of the Ruse district.
Two of the sites will be renewable energy production sites
The Torbeyevo sites in Luberce and Timochovo in Bogorodsk will be sites for the production of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
The Torbeyev site will be the site of a gas piston power plant that will be able to produce up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigahydrocalories of heat per year.
"Timohovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste recycling complex.
And the Kucino training ground in Balashih, which was closed after residents complained about the "straight line" with the president, could be a museum.
"There was an idea to create a museum of the re-cultivation of the Moscow region", - said Deputy Prime Minister of the region, Minister of Ecology and Nature Conservation Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reports a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli drone has crashed in southern Lebanon.

There is no risk of information leakage", the Israeli army tweeted.

"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a deputy so that the region does not slip without power...

According to Degtyarev, now the Khabarovsk region cannot remain without a leader, so he was appointed by the decree of President Vladimir Putin to the post of head of the region, so that "the wonderful building (the government of the region) functioned, everything worked, the budget was spent on social needs".
The acting governor explained that he had not been out to the protesters before because he could not communicate with the thousands of protesters.
So he's been running social media feeds and reading all the comments.
On July 25, two consecutive protests took place in Khabarovsk.
Rallies in support of the former governor have been held in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next rally, Mikhail Degtyarev announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His motorcade was stopped by protesters and called for a statement on the fate of the arrested ex-governor Furgal.
Degtyarev had previously refused to go out to the participants of the demonstrations.
"There's more to do for the manager than go out and talk to the screaming people outside the windows", the governor's deputy said.

The beautiful high minarets have only adorned the Hagia Sophia
Once again, about Ayasofya, there's a text from Vladimir Zelinski, which, they say, should be protested.
First, it was free - ho!
I've never been to Istanbul, but it's better to go to the House of God for free than for a fee.
Second, the Muslims have conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Ok riverbed, the Muslim Caucasus (and put up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews have conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
We're gonna give it back to everybody?
Do you think there are no pagans who will demand the return of their shrine, which is the Tithing Church?
Third, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, it is theirs, just like the factories and estates that Leninists took from the bourgeoisie as their own, belong to Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to the hangar, so they're all progressive by right.
The beautiful high minarets have really decorated Hagia Sophia, really.
There was a stupid ink shop, now there's a stupid ink shop with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjis who mix faith and hypocrisy.
A person who believes in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
That's the thinking of a British Foreign Office official, Toynbee, who is ashamed to think that way.
And the believer has a place to pray.
I always have.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to turn away.
He's a believer, not a defender.
We are the stones, not the stones.

Rwandan man confesses to setting fire to cathedral in Nantes
A Rwandan man who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Nantes, France, on a voluntary basis, confessed to setting it on fire a week later.
This is reported on Sunday by the TV channel "France-3".
According to him, the man who was detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
He appeared before the investigating judge Saturday night.
After being charged with malicious destruction of property, the man admitted to setting fires in three places - under a large organ, under a small organ and under an electrical shield.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The motives of the 39-year-old Rwandan have not been disclosed.
All that is known is that he volunteered to help in the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to surveillance footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after the fire was called in.
The fire in the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for several hours to secure the Gothic architecture.
However, they failed to save the stained glass windows of Louis XII's time and the unique Baroque organ.
The fire was not brought under control until three hours later.
No one was injured in the accident.
This is not the first fire in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to repair the damage.
The cathedral was reopened to the public only in 1985.

Kirilenko shares memories of playing with Bryant and Jordan in the NBA
Russian Basketball Federation (RFB) head Andrei Kirilenko shared his memories of playing against legendary Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan in National Basketball Association (NBA) matches .
I knew Bryant's ego couldn't be touched by a crackpot, so as not to stimulate his sports anger.
Kobe had killer instincts, so on the set I tried to talk him out of taking the game in an aggressive way.
I complimented him on the set, "Oh!
Kobe, good shot, great pass!
Heard my enthusiastic response, he almost forgot that he needed to get the ball in his hands one more time and score another three or four points.
We had a good relationship with Kobe", Kirilenko was quoted as saying by "Evening Moscow".
He also told about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the game, I ran in complete awe of having a legend with me that I'd only seen on TV.
While I was breathless with joy, Michael was scoring a lot of points.
I soon went from delight to delight, and I covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points", - added the head of the RFB.
Kirilenko played 12 seasons in the NBA.

The acting governor of the Khabarovsk region, Mikhail Degtyarev, during a meeting with residents of the Soviet Havana on Sunday, July 26, was surprised that the region buys the Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.

Also, the acting governor stressed that by 2025 Gazprom will switch to supplying Russian TPPs and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used "at normal prices".
The Sakhalin-1 project is being implemented through a product sharing agreement, with Exxon Neftegas Ltd operating the project with a 30% stake, Rosneft with another 20%, Japanese Sodeco with 30% and Indian ONGC with 20%.
Khabarovsk Territory has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

Russian TV actor responds to accusations of "LGBT and feminist propaganda"
The actor of the Russian series "Chickie", whose creators were accused of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism", responded to the claims against the film.
The authors "understood the acuteness of the issues raised and did not want to offend anyone", said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Podzem".

It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism", said the actor, who played the father of a boy who dressed as a woman.
He stressed that he was "proud of the work" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, he added, he is afraid of the reaction of some people to the plot line of the show: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep drunken rage shot up the set and said that it was not true".
