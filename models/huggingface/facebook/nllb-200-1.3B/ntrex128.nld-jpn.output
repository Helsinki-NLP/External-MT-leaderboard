Members of the National Assembly from various political parties are concerned that the new name will seem ridiculous.

for "crazy" in Welsh and "pwp" for "poop".


In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
It is of course the members of the National Assembly for Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people thought the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs was proposed by the Commission, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.


Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name

The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that it would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications to join the EU and NATO.


St. Martin's bells are silent Harlem bells are having a hard time
"The older people I spoke to said that here used to be a café and a church located on every corner, said Mr. Adams.
Nowadays, there is no trace of a café or a church.
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
People are now in a different way of social contact, he said.
Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.
He is concerned, however, that the proceeds from the sale of the assets of the churches will not last as long as the leaders expect,and sooner or later they will return to the beginning.

The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white, he says,which will lead to these churches being closed even faster because it is unlikely that the people who move into these flats will become members of the church community.
both churches were once built by a white church congregation, before harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, saint martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist church congregation left in the 1930s.
A black church from the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or get promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Reverend Johnson made plans to rebuild the church, they also purchased a porch.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St Martin's, proudly called the bead the bells of the poor.

The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bar in the world ever to be played by a black musician, namely Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger bar of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martins are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese would overpay the costs to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.

Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who was hiding for lobsters in California, and the boy was injured, so it says.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and along with several others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy was screaming because he caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, "I got bit!"
I got bit!
His clavicle was completely open, saw Hammel as he approached the boy.
I shouted for everyone to get out of the water:There's a shark in the water!
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of death.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Seawatch Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the vicinity a few weeks earlier, but that it had been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had severe injuries to the upper body.

Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Sainsbury's wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.

The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up, now that most products are suitable for vegans, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
The Fragrance Shop will also test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first having opened in Croydon, south London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more people shop online and buy smaller quantities of food daily from local supermarkets, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, says that stores will increasingly look like department stores, as the supermarket chain competes with discount stores Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. The company says this has increased food sales and increased the returns on acquisitions.
Last time the supermarket tried to make its beauty and pharmacy departments look like they were going to be a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy department to the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy stores three years ago for £125 million to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Sainsbury's Commercial Director, Paul Mills-Hicks, said:We've completely redesigned our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our staff, who will be ready to provide advice.

Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragon's Den, is "angry" because TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle company.
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The Jones and Willoughby company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones from Dragon's Den is furious with Holly Willoughby, for withdrawing at the last minute from their profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when Willoughby announced during a difficult meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new contracts (worth up to £1.5 million) are not allowing enough time for Truly, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
True was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would secure its future in the long run, and provide enough for the next few decades.
Everybody was stunned when she decided to retire.
nobody believed his ears last tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the Marlow headquarters is full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of the most profitable stars of Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
And that could mean the end of a friendship that lasted for years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became CEO in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the show I'm A Celebrity on the UK broadcaster ITV.

Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
I didn't give up anything.

But the negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have stalled.


Trump was much more optimistic in his speech at the election rally.
We do very well in North Korea, he said.
We were close to war with North Korea.
Millions would have died.
We have a great relationship now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results: the missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been released and the remains of US soldiers have been returned to their home country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here, said Trump, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Indonesia: Tsunami and earthquake devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.

In many cases it is unfortunately clear that they are not asking for international help, which is difficult for us said Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain if the foreign rescuers will be able to work on the ground.



The fact that no tsunami warning siren was present in Palu, even though a warning was in effect, probably contributed to the death toll.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the disaster site.




Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes an impressive tie against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was passed by Xherdan Shaqiri as he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team were 1-0 down.
He taped left on the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the top right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible, Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I dared a try. I didn't really think about it, I just kicked the ball.
Chelsea were 1-0 at half-time, after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then rushed through the midfield to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick one-tweet in the middle of the field.
He then made a nice pass, allowing Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool into the net, next to the back pole.
Liverpool will play Napoli at 3pm on Wednesday in the group stage of the Champions League, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea take on Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.

Cromwell statue at the British Parliament is latest victim of the 'rewrite history-rel
The banishment of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the painting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
The beautiful statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many say still deserves recognition today.
Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, to be the defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case of course the monarchy.

What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be recognized and commemorated.
Killer pig kills Chinese farmer

Yuan, was found dead at a barn in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, with his artery punctured and covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, on May 30, 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.

The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the pigsty.
The report states that a forensic investigation revealed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer.
My cousin's legs were bloodied and mutilated, said the cousin with the surname Wu, according to the newspaper Guiyang Evening News.

I found his body about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.


It's rare, but there have been cases before where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
10 years ago, a 300-kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
They're just playful.
like children, very curious... they don't mean to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.

Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing


Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that a drunken Kavanaugh had touched her and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a lively testimony that he was 100% certain that this hadn't happened.

The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not received any comments from the interested parties.
Nielsen has trouble counting people who are looking in an office.
To put it in perspective, this is like a football game play-off or an Oscar ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's nomination, had the most viewers on the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public continued to be very interested.

He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes down as he was being insulted, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Crees he's telling the public the truth?
"You have power, whereas so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and right before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more at the hearing.
The various stations broadcasted the whole thing live as the Judiciary Committee voted hours later on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
Flake said he would only vote for the nomination on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats in the minority are pushing for.
Flake was persuaded by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important, because it was clear that the Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.

Then later that day, there were skirmishes with the police, and the cops took their batons up to stop the fighting.

14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local press reported.

The voters were overwhelmingly in favour of becoming independent, although turnout was low and the people who are against secession boycotted the vote.

The demonstration continued, but people were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck he said.

Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
Tensions are rising, he said.

A candidatura alle elezioni europee è il modo migliore per denunciare il deterioramento dei valori democratici e la repressione che abbiamo visto dal governo spagnolo, ha detto.

Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought them victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in an 18-game run since he has been manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to equal Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed to win a playoff game this season in the Premiership, and they must face leader Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
t, Rangers Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, remains undefeated, the team has now won six games in a row in his division, and Coach Holt has not suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against strong visitors
Holt's team could have taken a lead long before the first goal, because their direct way of playing caused all sorts of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, and then Alan Lithgow, who was catching the head ball from Craig Halkett, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team enjoyed the Rangers playing, and waited for their chance calmly and confidently.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
at that point, the Rangers had been in possession of the ball for a long time, but the home team's defense was unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do yet.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to prevent a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball into the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a run by his fellow Livingston.
Continuously, forwards reached Livingston's penalty area, but they were denied each time. Twice a penalty was denied, once after Halketts attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and once for handball.
Livingston's "phenomenal" - analysis of the phenomenal - Livingston's phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal - the phenomenal
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They played exceptionally well and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
their playing style and the composition of their team has hardly changed since their return to the top regions, but especially Holt deserves much recognition for the way he has blown up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with a superbly organised defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Although they have played very well under Gerrard many times, this time they did not reach their usual level.

Erdogan receives mixed feelings in Cologne

It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues like human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU membership.

Rosa
It's rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving across the southwest desert area, bringing with it flood risks.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday, and it's going to rain by Monday night.

Trump says Kavanaugh 'has suffered from the meanness, the rage' of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party",said Trump at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has continually "suffered from the meanness, the wrath" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process
Kavanaugh testified to Congress Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
President Obama said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage that day.
A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record, he told the crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of the Republican lead in the midterm elections.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I don't participate, but actually I do participate he said.
That's why I'm always up for great candidates.
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and obstruct us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place Friday, a top GOP official told CNN.

The tsunami was caused by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach.They did not walk away immediately and thus became the victims of the tsunami, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of Indonesian Disaster Relief Bureau BNPB said during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on the land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.



The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
Indonesia's Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.

Nugroho described the damage as significant and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.

Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.

The Red Cross said in a statement that staff and volunteers from the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse said the Red Cross.


Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't verify the footage right away.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.



Tsunami death toll rises to over 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city, where employees in the courtyard of their office are sheltering in canvas tents, but passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
Ili told me they saw many houses that were destroyedhe said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups started the difficult task of getting the emergency aid going, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.

eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
It is still a provincial disaster, said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says:O.K., this is a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.

Mr. Gendon said that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread in the paragliding community and that in the hours afterwards he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.

I think that means the messages haven't been delivered, he said.

Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
The being formally known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been briefly referred to as Ye for some time and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for emotional reasons, says the show's creator.

ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it meansjij, West said earlier this year, when he was talking about the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.I'm you, it's us, it's us.I'm you, it's us.I'm you, it's us.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West in the past, has also worked with and without the hyphen and capital letters.
Mexican President Promises to Use No Armed Forces Against Civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
Lopez Obrador promulgated on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people. During this period leftist student movements arose throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of opportunities to study.
United States should double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it spends on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He's saying this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. doesn't have a formal A.I. strategy.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Dupling the budget for AI research would be a good start already, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI, said Lee.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chance that the next big achievement for A.I. will happen in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order is published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat the best player of American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese division of Google.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, said Lee.
China does not take our best academics, the corporations do, said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been recruiting the best people from universities to work on A.I. in the last few years.
Lee said that the U.S. A.I. effort would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
Doctorate in A.I. should automatically be offered a green card, he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Science Foundation provides financial support to staff from academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.

And this month, DARPA announced that they're going to invest $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million in AI research.
The US legislation which should lead to the creation of a national security committee for artificial intelligence has been in the doldrums for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country

Greece has a province also called Macedonia and says that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country claims Greek territory. Therefore Greece vetoed Macedonia's admission to the European Union and NATO.

President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and because of a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required turnout of at least 50% will be achieved, thus the referendum may not be valid.
Do you support NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and others who support the name change believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies like the EU and NATO.
I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.


The National Electoral Commission said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1pm.

We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a backdoor, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority is in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" as a result would be a "confirmation of our future".


70% would vote yes.
if the referendum is to be successful, the turnout has to be 50% plus one vote.
The European Parliament has been the most vocal in its support for the European Union.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's full defence and scores

It was a piece of cake how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball first in the midfield.
He raced through three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
Aguero has problems with his feet, coach Pep Guardiola of Manchester City told the press.
We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.
i Sterlingiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in the Brighton playing field.
He sent a beautiful pass across the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
Sky Blues player kicked the ball into the net just before it was too far.
City will face Hoffenheim at 12.55pm on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage, to be played at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play and make it hard for the Rockies to reach the playoffs
With the Washington Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to force a fresh start.

Rockies have at least secured a wild card for the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday, but now they're looking to do everything they can to secure their first division title.
Although there's nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver with this audience will be optimal and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on the move on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to draft Scherzer as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was making his 34th start, was in the pitching field on Thursday and would pitch the following Sunday, although that's normally his day off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is hosting a rally in West Virginia
President Obama indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court, while he was talking about the importance of the Republican ticket in the midterm elections.
Everything we've achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives is going to take place.
"I'm not running, but I'm actually running", he said."That's why I'm running for great candidates everywhere".
We see a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do to do it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and obstruct us".
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and fake and lying".
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud cheers from the public.

Did you leak the document?
,, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. That was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The Party is intolerant of people who say what they think
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
my colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly for standing firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, about issues like this where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


This started shortly after Jeremy became leader
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
And that's all I'm going through.


one of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe verbal abuse is apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every motion of no confidence or change in selection rules the party gets smaller.

But that's not why I got into politics.
32 years ago, since I joined Labour as a schoolboy, provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government which literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated for better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy positions and my differences with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the Friday motion, I can only say one thing: when the country is dragged into a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.

38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on their way to the top
Two late tries may have slightly skewed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr rightfully triumphs in this glorious match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
now top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the top ten.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
We've had it hard so far in our matches and we're still undefeated, so I'm a happy man, he said.
All credit to Ayr, they've taken their chances better than we have.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Climo kicked a penalty to give Ayr an extra lead and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the break, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long halted by a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and once the match was restarted, Ayr could continue to run out by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson secured a touchdown at the penalty line-out behind the advancing Ayr muzzle.
Climo was responsible for the conversion, and did so again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe took the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.

'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to the Pacific
Navegantes patrollando una oficina naval en la paz.
Public buildings are waving an ocean blue flag.
The sea is ours
It's a duty to win them back.


Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and naturally looks forward to the outcome, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.

Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is up for a controversial re-election fight next year, also has a lot at stake with Monday's ruling.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he swore at the end of August.

The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its ruling only six months after the final hearing, indicates that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive outcome for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the last four years the situation may have even gotten worse.
The case around the access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government, said Zárate.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile may have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to talk further after this.

Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was taken unusually quickly.
Boliviawill have an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile and a chance toend 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind us.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.

He made the remarks at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.

Washington is unwilling to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second summit.

Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Show unveils latest collection of huge head covers, soon to be on sale in your neighborhood
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun out of your eyes completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move at Paris Fashion Week.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Valentino's signature piece was a giant beige hat decorated with a feathery wide rim, hanging over the eyes of the models.
Other oversized accessories were gem-covered watermelons, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple, but these aren't designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
one creature looked like scuba gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like melted ice.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're in luck.
TYLE WATCHERS predict that the giant hats will find their way to the clothing stores in your neighborhood.
The giant hats may have been inspired by "La Bomba", the two-meter-wide straw hat that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was all over social media also spawned another big creation on the catwalk: a straw bag that was almost as big as the model in bathing suit that was sewn into the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather hinge, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer.Given the designer's huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra big accessories".
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for World Citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a series of excellent exam results, and furthermore individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects within schools.
Nelson Mandela said:
Parler dans sa langue maternelle, c'est toucher son cœur.
This is a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and bonds of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exams, we can infer that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages scored highly.
A) in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students and 63% of Spanish students also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
language is now valued as a subject choice as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) in independent school programmes and elsewhere.

language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.

••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only language to stand out above the 10%, with a total of 15%.
nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Knowing more languages, particularly those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
whatever your child's interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialised in this area.
Scotland's Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future.

Modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire. Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools

Trump's election rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a long series of rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia,
It's the first of five rallies planned by Trump in the coming week, including stops in places he likes, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
What time does the Trump rally in West Virginia start tonight?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 PM.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about the hearings for nominee Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have been heightened with Kavanaugh being accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may have to wait a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI investigates the case.

The Trump campaign said these five rallies over the next week are meant to boost volunteers and supporters, as the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Control of Congress is so important to his program, that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins, a Trump campaign spokesperson who did not want to be named told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time in the last month, the state he won in 2016 by over 40 percent.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is falling behind in the polls.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the lead-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chance is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who's got the best shot right now?
They had a six-point lead, and now it's only four more, so we kind of feel like luck is on our side right now, said Jordan Spieth before he left at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage of being four points ahead of the other 12 in the game.
The Americans feel, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and scored three points each of the four.
Spieth has been a formidable opponent from tee to green and he sets the example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well grew louder as his round progressed and he made a crucial putt that made game four a success as he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
his putt that won the match at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind that you can infer that he believes the U.S. team is undefeated yet.
You have to dig deep and worry only about your own game said Spieth.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delightful European duo has four on four and can do no wrong.
Moliwoodwas the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
because of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy crowd, they are the players to beat on sunday. if fleetwood or molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to score a european victory when the sun sets over le golf national.
preferibly both at the same time at different holes.

Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a quickie with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of the morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
a bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a gap for the Spaniard and the Swede who couldn't get over.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has played its best so far and has a nice lead in the run up to the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is starting with a great lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, and after Saturday's four-ball and foursomes, they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The spirited duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two more wins than Tiger Woods, who was having a hard time, giving them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who are eager to reclaim the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, were stronger than the blundering Americans in the morning's four-ball, with a score of 3-1.
USA resisted more in the foursomes, where they won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needs to score eight points in Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, after a sensational weekend are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and beat a disappointing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, back for the four-balls of Tuesday morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world's number one and number three, with 2&1.
Though Europe was not at ease on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won after a hard-fought 2&1 by Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It's only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has managed to catch up a four-point deficit at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has plenty of tie-breakers, as they currently hold the trophy.
t now that they've been second for two days,it seems too high-profile to counterattack on a Sunday.
North Korea says it will no way unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to growing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.

However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm.


North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearization first and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the declaration of the end of war, said Ri.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant about us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions only reinforce our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader did suggest earlier this week at the United Nations.
If the other party in this denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a dead end.

Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, this year praised Kim at the UN for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much more needs to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved complete, final, verified denuclearization.
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to severely reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit went badly.

North Korea promised during a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take appropriate measures.

Harvard students take a class on the importance of adequate rest
Harvard University is introducing a new course this year to get all students more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture where it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
one professor found that students at the world's greatest university often have no idea of the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist associated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he knows is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When I was done, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing this now, in my senior year?'
She said that nobody had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being organized for the first time this year, will teach students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was determined that students were severely sleep-deprived during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices, and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine for sleep.
In another section, participants are told how lack of sleep increases the long-term risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this won't change the behavior of the students immediately.

The culture of overnight studying is still there, he says, and with modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
Providing adequate, good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physics student, helped Professor Czeisler to write the course, having attended classes with the professor last year when he was a freshman at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make sure that the course was available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar programme of study before coming to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for their bedtime, and not just an alarm for getting up, but also be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks Gerrard's men out of the game
Rangers again saw their away game disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and beat Steven Gerrard's weak team 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox team were hoping for their first away win since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's side managed to clinch the defeat, barely Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games.
Menga scored at seven minutes to spare, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in goals against Hibernian.
Rangers could get in more trouble, as Boundary Judge Calum Spence was being treated for a head injury after apparently being thrown an object by the visiting team's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team, they passed Ayr and go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed on the same team for Livingston, who had just conceded a point to the Hearts last week, and he would have been delighted by the way his well-trained team was able to block the opponents on every move.
Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga delivered the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had a goal in sight from Allan McGregor, but the midfielder couldn't finish.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to be hoping for a good outcome rather than really believing in getting close to the goal.
Alfredo Morelos felt he was entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless clashed after 15 minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson turned down the Colombian's request.
Rangers were only able to shoot twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who was previously goalkeeper at Ibrox, was able to stop Lassana Coulibaly's headball and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot with ease.
Livingston's 34th-minute opener may not be in the running for the overall game, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
again, the Rangers were not up to Jacobs' deep game.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and selected Menga, who kicked the ball into the goal with ease.
Gerrard made an interception with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent switch, which had almost immediate effects when winger Morelos passed, but an impressive Kelly racketed away from his line to stop the ball.
Livingston kept forcing the visitors to play the kind of game he likes to play, where Lithgow and Halkett keep kicking long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage of the game, but McGregor held on and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton requested a penalty kick at the end of the game after a run-in with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way again.
Almanak: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for who can count well... the day the future physicist Johannes WilhelmHans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
Bells or Coronado, a 1950 film starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter. It's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
Si vous mettez ces écouteurs, vous entendez l'effet des atomes émis par la radioactivité dans les minéraux.
It's really popping now!
Hans Geiger starved in 1945, barely a few days before his 63rd birthday.

New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells
Vaccination teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient to transform them into a laboratory.
They can then see a protein that is common in many types of cancer and then they get re-injected.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for over 18 months
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, then modifying the cells in the lab to see the HER2 protein, which is common in all types of cancer, and then re-injecting the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method of removing immune cells from patients and teaching these cells to target cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West takes a pro-Trump rant and wears a MAGA cap after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a dissonant performance praising US President Donald Trump and saying he would run for president in 2020.
After delivering his third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a cap with the words "Make America Great Again", he lashed out at the Democrats and repeatedly backed Trump.
Sometimes when I talk to a white person, they ask me,How can you sympathize with Trump?
"If I was worried about racism, I'd be long gone from America", he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a parody where Hollywood star Matt Damon defied the Senate Judiciary Committee with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony regarding the alleged assault allegedly perpetrated by Christine Blasey Ford.
West's ranting didn't air, but comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
t is not clear if Rock wants to use his mail to stake the dragon with West.
West also complained to the audience that he was being shot backstage for his hat.
They teased me backstage.
"Don't go on stage with that hat".
They've been teasing me!
, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued:
Give me some love.

West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love it while he was dressed as a Perrier bottle.


But I choose NOT to reward someone who supports and spits out an ideology that is damaging my community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art).
He's free to do what he wants.

He's not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, aka Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is coming out with toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.


Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
"For me personally right now this is a really important question: where did our manhood go wrong?" he said.
"What did we teach men when they were growing up that's causing us to face this problem?"
Kit thinks television might be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, because of its very masculine characters.
What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?e di?
...because something's clearly gone wrong for young men.

Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful follow-up to Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the series, so that way I've left my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in the past in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer a crime in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted by inadequate protection in the sexual intercourse in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff member leaked Republican senators' records and cites dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
US Congresswoman Maxine Waters is arguing against the allegations that one of her staffers has posted the personal data of three US Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat claims that the accusations are being spread by extreme right pundits and websites.
Lies, lies and more nasty lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and private phone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on the sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained the information of a Waters employee, the Hill said.
"This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie", Waters said.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these false accusations, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
This denial sounds angry, wrote Fleischer.
You can tell from this that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congressman.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He mustn't rebel.
He mustn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being overly angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters's place in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
Serious, if it's true, he tweeted.
Waters stated that her office had informed the relevant agencies and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
We will make sure the perpetrators are known, she saidand that they are held legally accountable for all their actions which are destructive and dangerous to my staff members.
Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
s this lighthearted self-satire about how bad we're doing is gonna be the latest export for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with protruding eyes and flexible facial features at least manages to control everything in the hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was designed for cinema goers in countries where people speak a language other than English.
He's the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to slick glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a touch of the guy who contributed one note to the Chariots of Fire theme song during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.

His latest portrait of Johnny English has a nice moment or two.
I loved the way Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tap against his helmet.
Atkinson can show in this movie how much talent he has for physical comedy, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough excessive, especially now that the serious film series like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems more for children than for adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English seems to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean played by Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in big trouble.
Hacker has infiltrated the supersecret spy network on the web, revealing the identities of all active British secret agents, much to the horror of the acting agent, a small role unfortunately played by Kevin Eldon.
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character that reminds me of Teresa May, but the script doesn't offer much material to work with.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Johnny English, who is now a schoolmaster in a fancy institution, but informally teaches undercover work. Here's some fun jokes in the story, because the spy reading from English reminds me of School of Rock.
English is summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is captain of a submarine, a turbulent and juvenile role below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin from the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.

English and Bough begin their odyssey of creepy crazy fun: dressed as waiters they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, they make a fuss aboard Volta's luxury yacht and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.

It's not all that original.
And just like all the other Johnny English films, I wonder if the British film industry can't really come up with a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies the party is devising a plan where British people work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan whereby British people work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants bosses to pass on the savings they're making as a result of the AI revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
Fits the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the balance of the country towards the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek has already been approved by the Confederation of Trade Unions, which sees it as a good way to ensure that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times:A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits within the party's drive to shift the balance of the economy more to the benefit of the workers and that also fits within the party's overall industrial strategy".


A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make clear his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the "faceless executives" and the "profiteers" in utility companies.


Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week, and raises the question of whether the FBI findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the nominee.
In an interview aired on Sunday on "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might discover anything that might lead to their changing of minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
"I told the court that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be firmly planted.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite", he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.

What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival is taking place, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and which has an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international activists who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of 'clicktivism', making people feel like they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?

According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped to get world leaders involved and to make policy proposals worth over 37 billion dollars that should change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.

The group estimates that the funds raised have so far impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives with the goal of "helping children realize their full potential", has pledged $35 million to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"n the help of the UK government, of donors, of other national governments and of Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.

In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website, which asked, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
the group replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult journey, where we're going to fall and fail sometimes.
like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed in the end because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform this year at the event in New York City which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy for a 'blockade' to impede Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, stated Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of the Interior, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And the official says there are ways and means to stop this.
"The United States has that capability, with the navy, to make sure that the shipping lanes stay open and, if necessary, to block them to make sure that their energy doesn't come to market", he said.
Zinke spoke to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that bills itself as the 'voice of the energy consumer' in the United States.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Russia with the approach to Iran and noted that they are not fundamentally different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a country that only knows a "little art", with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.


Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion which will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their own suppliers", said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian energy minister, after meeting Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and that includes a woman in the top position", she said, according to the political newsletter The Hill.
"n the 6th of November, I will seriously consider running for President".
Warren spoke out against President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying that he was "steering this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is bringing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.



32% were in favour of her running for office.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favour of a possible candidacy and 48% against.

Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during a Donald Trump election rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
He was arrested and charged following a domestic violence report Monday night.
"Through what my own son has to go through, what he's going through now that he's back, I understand for other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with", she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little bit different, they're coming back and they've gotten harder, they're coming back and they're wondering if there's respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military people have given for the country".

Washington D.C. and 18 states support protest against new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a "friend-of-the-court" statement in the Washington court last Friday in support of an asylum seeker who challenges this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been released.
She says that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her but that US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas for that.

The new US asylum policy reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an impediment is contrary to that principle", states a statement by the "Friend of Court".

Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General, ordered in June that judges no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", said Sessions in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these are serious problems, that people face every day, all over the world.

Ambassador accuses China of 'intimidation' with 'propaganda ads'

Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked, according to US officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.

China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the US Ambassador to China and formerly long time Governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit American workers, farmers and companies.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, "is now doubling down on intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China is taking advantage of freedom of speech and a free press, a long-cherished tradition in America by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"By contrast, you will find in a kiosk in the center of Beijing vain dissenting voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish his article", as if he didn't say which newspaper this was.
Kavanaugh debacle alienated Republican female voters just before the midterm elections, warn analysts

The emotions around this issue have been huge and most Republicans have already indicated they want to go ahead with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed", Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if Senator Jeff Flake (Republican, Arizona) 's last-minute attempt to advocate for an FBI investigation would be enough to satisfy angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow and they are not going to forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. news outlet.

"Enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high", Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high, and it's true.
"But it can go up even further, particularly among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who often don't vote even though they disagree with the president".

"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former party chairman of the Republican Party, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in committee, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh goes to court, but it's also about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her", explains Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, to the news channel.


38% thought Kavanaugh probably lied during his testimony while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Flake's prosecution, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project from the tech legend, is a company that is based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the option to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" is the guiding idea behind Inrupt.
"We have to do this now", he said about the startup.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
This can store contact lists, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available together in one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it's completely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt is, according to CEO John Bruce, that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was bought by IBM, a few developers who have been contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to talk to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that completely turns all their business models upside down all at once".
"We're not asking for their permission".

Bernard Vann: Clergyman and Victoria Cross winner from WWI
The only Church of England clergyman to have earned a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier is being honoured 100 years later in the town of his birth.
Lieutenant Colonel, the Rev. Bernard Vann was awarded the medal for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, thus never knowing that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.

one of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been honored.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
He later rushed to the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and killing three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never guess about, but also something that makes me feel humbled".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honoured to play a part in the parade", adding that "the bravery of a true hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night watching a Bellator 206 and missing the most important moment.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, including six in the main section, and was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, UK viewers were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged that they had stayed up all night just for this fight.

"Under government regulations, no content that is not suitable for children can be shown after 6:00 a.m., and that's why we had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Scott Coker, Bellator's CEO, said they're going to adjust their programming to ensure UK viewers get a chance in the future.
"I think, in terms of the counter-match, we can solve this problem", said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and trust me, they weren't all equally friendly.
tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
n't that was the case. It was a government issue.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We're limiting the show to five nights instead of six, as we normally do, we're trying to make it even better for the fans, but we're just going too far.
It's an unfortunate situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual orientation
Tom Daley, Olympic long jumper, says that as a child, he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that until he went to graduate school, he did not realize that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Lauren Laverne on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that parenting had contributed to his less appreciation for winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a disconnect on Laverne's first program, Daley told that during his childhood he felt 'less' than others because it was 'not socially accepted to like both girls and boys'.
"To this day", he said, "those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful".
He wanted to prove that he was "somebody" so that he would not disappoint people if they eventually found out his nature.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he considered himself lucky to be able to live openly without further consequences and because he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you have to go through so much at such a young age", he competed in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find anyone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you'd asked me this question last year, I would have said that it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning Olympic gold medals.
"Olympic gold medal for me is Robbie".

Daley said that his father hadn't accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be around to sit on the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until his breathing actually stopped and he died, that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.

Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson from the United States will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must find his form again to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than being the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors splits the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, trying to figure out what's missing.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
And if the track itself isn't daunting enough, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, in the ninth match on Sunday, who is tied with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of the 12 singles matches, start well, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown to have confidence in this man, even though he could hardly be otherwise.
He fully understood the role he had today, he slapped me on the back, he put his arm around me and he said he was ready for tomorrow", said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams, in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more from it, but it is what it is and it is the way we thought we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everybody else".
Mickelson could beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career where he never quite matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain tangible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's got a way, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I think the younger players liked to fool him occasionally last week, which was fun to watch.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead prior to the singles matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the competition in Valderrama in 1997, where the team with as captain Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but in the end passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just now", said Bjorn, phoned here, after watching the 2018 squad win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game that's been played.
tomorrow, everyone will have to be fully engaged.
Get to work and execute the plan properly.
It's not over till the dots are on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we have to stay focused on that.
"I keep saying, I'm focusing on the 12 players we have, but we're also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who was delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, added: "I would never be ahead of the game.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tomorrow is the individual performance, and that's another totally different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when it's going well, but when you're on your own, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
e message is to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
"So let your partner go, and let him get the best of himself".

Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word from that speech", he said in response to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had pumped up his players for the final day.
"We have 12 important matches to bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medina.
nce we have the momentum, there's gonna be a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
"We've aligned our lineup to this and we're sending the men out in the order we think is best and, you know, we're gonna try and pull something out of the hat tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the lineup.
"I chose this group in this order, because I think we're so constantly covered", said Bjorn of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have entered service in 2014, replacing the aging warships of the Cold War, but it will take at least another year before it is ready, due to defective systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the lead ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far from home ports.

The F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.

software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels are operated by a crew of approximately 120 seamen, half the manpower of the older Bremen class frigates.

The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
Besides the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are made all the more important by recent warnings that the German navy is losing power.

The official said that the problem has grown over time like a snowball, as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were available for enlistment.
National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats

It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bats, the brown great-eared bats and the water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the bat's activities throughout the season.

Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind of what it does.
The project will produce a map of the habitat and a report to provide a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how these are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating pastures and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect habitats and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bates are not really blind.

They use advanced echo-location techniques to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.


The organisation has even set up the first and only bat sanctuary in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, a landscape architect, says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a great environment for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of very old trees and the right habitat.
"But there's so much we don't know about bats yet, and so the work we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive".

Bates are a protected species and it is illegal to kill them, to harass or disturb them or to destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don't know how many of our species are doing with their populations".
Ronaldo rejects assault charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo qualified accusations of assault as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.

Portugal e Juventus são acusados de agredir uma mulher americana, chamada Kathryn Mayorga, num quarto de hotel em Las Vegas em 2009.

️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
"No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this".
what they say today, fake news", says the five-time Golden Ball winner on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
e normal.
They want to be famous by calling my name, but that's part of the job.
" he added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to sue Der Spiegel for what they called 'unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said that the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident reportedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Mayorga asserts that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a '99%' good guy, but that he is sometimes abandoned by that '1%'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was 'afraid of the consequences' and because she was concerned about the 'public humiliation'.
34-year-old now says she wants the arrangement invalidated because she's been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and has left for Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' if car manufacturers leave
UK will 'regret it forever' if it loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Greg Clark, the UK's economic affairs minister.

"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a 'no-deal Brexit' would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that if the UK crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory come to a halt", said Marvin Cooke, the managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.

BMW, for example, has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
car manufacturers are most concerned about supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'just-in-time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border unrest which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot store more than one day of stock in the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and therefore production would be halted in that case.
Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly tailored to avoid those checks at the border', said Clark.
"We need a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue our current success, but also to seize this opportunity", he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota did not say how long the production would be stopped, but warned in the longer term that the extra costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and who represents the Unite union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said:We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, says White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been the Washington gossip machine for months.

Rosenstein denied this report.
ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttT

Trump said he 'would rather not' fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate once again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press officer, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
"We'll see, and I'd like to keep the press informed".
Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attention-grabbing" TV reporters, although, she added: "I won't deny that they are trying to get attention".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence for this,"We looked at the numbers".
Sanderssaid:
"We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
press conference with only the president is rare.
New York City This week, the president demonstrated why, making a candid and sometimes bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
UK Health Minister writes Brexit letter to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they continue to work in the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to cover the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, the UK-EU negotiations continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no deal scenario.
i know these must be uncertain times for all of you.

colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we'd like you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie, yesterday underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the sideline and he kind of went down there", said Reed.
The trainers and the medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen immediately on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further examination.
Tennessee State officials told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are known yet about the type/size of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 tackles this season.
foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a house in the UK
foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans by the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters
The increase in levies is levied on non-taxable persons in the UK
The Treasury Department expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a house in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who is attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to tell this story to high earners.
The increase in the levies is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra proceeds being funneled into a government effort to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is on top of the current levies, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new construction in London is purchased by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for startups to get a foothold on the housing ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, particularly in the capital, have become practically 'ghost towns' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson had advocated for a reduction in taxes to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices high by buying land and not using it and he called upon May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to repair the 'housing scandal' in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking set of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as Prime Minister restoring the 'British Dream', that life is better for every new generation.
And that means our broken housing market needs to be repaired.
UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
t can't be that it's as easy for non-UK residents, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a home has become too vague, and the humiliation of living without a roof over their heads is too real".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland, says it is his "ultimate ambition" to be manager of Scotland one day.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the North East of England, who are currently third in League One, three points from first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.

"When I was a kid I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden Park with my dad and it's something that keeps me going.
"However, that possibility would only come if I am successful in managing a club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor of these established names at a big club, having previously turned down advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
"Its structure and facilities make it a Premier League club", he says.
"It's not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful if I bring the club back there".
Ross has been managing for just three years, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching group.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and transformed St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
Ross says he's more comfortable now than he ever was during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he remembered the moment he took over at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Football can be hard.
There are many things you face each week.
I still do, given the stress and pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I am, I feel more comfortable than I have ever felt in my adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has boosted the revenues of British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw their sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue was down 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy that compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more turnover, with the difference that restaurants were now hit even harder.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June, only got worse in July.
pubs and bars focused on selling liquor performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants declining.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food also get sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
In pubs and bars under management, the beverage turnover was 6.6 percent higher for the month, while the food turnover was 3 percent lower".
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality industry analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we've been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the main factors for turnover in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused operators and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August will give the much-needed respite".
The total turnover growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion.

This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being posted
20% of the students say they have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
1 in 5 children, some under 11 years old, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'fake Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has reinforced the fear that sexual content is being posted.
20% of the students say they use a clean 'main account' which they show to their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be on her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager asking others to "rape" her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, Head of HCM, said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete'
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of the Scottish Athletic World, as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete on and off the track and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport's governing bodies to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish athletic community, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her election to the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I'm happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope to contribute and help govern the sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four Olympic gold medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, was unable to walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It's been a lot of hard work, but I'm completely recovered, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing my flexibility exercises again today!

An ad for breast pump comparing mothers to cows is dividing online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has spread the word online with an advertisement comparing nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what has been called 'the world's quietest portable breast pump', consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released an ironic music video-inspired advertisement to illustrate the freedom this new pump offers to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see it" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't onions, these are my breasts".
"Pump, pump, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, I milk the ladies".

The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has generated hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying that this is a justification for the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"Bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within a few days of birth".
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commentator commented: "This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't looked it up too much.
This is a genius product", someone wrote.
"This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who pump (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows'.
This advert is not at all positive or negative for the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, you see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who plow sometimes feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they're pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing mother-pumping and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on pumping and the challenges that come with it, and at the same time, in an entertaining and understandable way, show how the new pump is going to create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.

Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and they are afraid to jeopardize their own chance of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to hand over their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified in congressional testimony that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or relatives of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large portion of them are criminal foreigners.
"We are prosecuting these individuals", Mr. Albence said.

Many of them will be in court via video conference, rather than in person, to argue their application for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
advocates said that these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, like tornillo, where the signs of a child struggling are more likely to be ignored, because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving children to tent camps without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends may contribute to the trauma many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, France and Turkey's 'occupation force' to withdraw immediately


"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the Assembly.


The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who are mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.

"We have made an appeal to the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They are politicizing a cause that should only be a humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live.


Moualem made clear what the conditions are for the Syrian government to participate in the commission and said that the work of the panel should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many 'liberal' viewers probably hope, his presidency is prematurely ended by impeachment and scandals.

And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen, when you realize that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of "deep background" sources by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear", who are talking about Paul Manafort's $15,000 paul leather jacket ("a garment full of arrogance" according to The Washington Post) and who are discussing the implications of Stormy Daniels' colorful description of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.

It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing a flood of money, thanks to a redistricting that's forced two sitting representatives to run for the same seat.
The newly redistricted Pittsburgh district is up for grabs by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps have been rearranged after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally rearranged ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has led to a campaign finance brawl between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump had won this district by a margin of 20 percentage points.
political experts say the democrats have a slight advantage.
The US considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China and has refrained from doing so.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked the Trump Organization management team out.


The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.


The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to deliver a speech at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the government attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh messages about punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesperson on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.

The next step may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible opposition of the judiciary by Trump, for which weighty evidence has now become public.
Mueller is likely to focus his investigation on conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in a Russian attack on our elections.

There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, that will determine how long the fight will last.

We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.

Americans are currently facing various of these kinds of inflections.
What are we gonna do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's in charge of the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this paper reported that he had, last year, suggested that he would hold secret talks with the president and that he had speculated about the president's suitability for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is incorrect.
"How will we react if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of assault and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?

"We went into the game with the idea that there was something to win and we came out with a point.

Women can't sleep because they're afraid of their pension
Though survey participants had a clear idea of the way they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the respondents to Nationwide's survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
e 10 pccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Let's start here.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you don't make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on how to pay these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care might include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or putting your equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when insurance must be used.
Get a health care proxy so you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and make sure the professionals abide by your wishes in case you can't communicate anymore.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that the bills are paid when you can no longer do this yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Get these details in a written plan so you have the information at hand.

Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for suspected terrorist in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overturning pedestrians and cyclists who came in his path in October.

both charges are punishable by death, according to the court document.
weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight counts of racketeering murder, a typical charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and one charge of violent and motor vehicle destruction.

Sajifoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, says the statement of intent.
5 of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been over a decade since the Southern District of New York had a case demanding the death penalty.

The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, who is from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about what he did, and they let the police know.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he is "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", said Patton.


Nigel Farage promised to mobilize a 'people's army'

Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK 'would be out' if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.

The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on track as it is attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.

Bone told a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull he wants to "throw Chequers in the trash".

"If he was the service, we'd be out now", said Bone.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash".

want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue".
The Conservative Brexitist Andrea Jenkyns also joined the march and told reporters: "I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not for votes, it is unpopular with our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we get elected.
"Leave the Chequers and listen to me".
In a direct message to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs, if they keep their promises".
Farage told the gathering that politicians must feel the 'heat' if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not gonna let you get away with this.'"

We are mobilizing the people's army of this country who have brought us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are once again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom".
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and ended this march with a two-hour rally in the city centre.

Lord Adonis, Labour Member of Parliament, made a joke about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can take care of IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to 'think hard' about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll "begin to think hard about running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican congressman who co-chaired Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might be running against Trump in 2020.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel leaves him the victory following orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas started well from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold as he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back to the lead after a wheel-on-wheel action which reluctantly forced the Ferrari driver to release space on the inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a while, sticking to his tyre choice and aiming for a quick finish, so he could overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.

It's a tough day because Valtteri did his best all weekend and he was a real gentleman and he let me pass.
"The team has done its best for places one and two", said Hamilton.
That was not good body language.

In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 1:10 p.m. before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's equaliser at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants to a first down, as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team rebounded and Bouchard again tied them with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the match, late in the second period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.

Air Niugini now says one man missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing, after previously reporting that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.


The airline said that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is remains unclear for now.
The airline and the US Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
some witnesses believe the plane was shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from the United States, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and a few others managed to wade through the water that came to their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
also said that the stewardesses were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head wound.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working at a nearby shipyard also helped with the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank further into the water some 100 feet [30 m] deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered with PNG over the past 20 years, but none of these have been related to Air Niugini.
Analyst records the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, analyst for the US Department of Justice, gave a few hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used the cell phone data to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she took her own life.
Rowlett stated that he had received location data from several cell phones which showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
n data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was on the stand Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told Sanford that he was in his truck that night, Sanford said that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told him he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated that they've only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis erased the texts, calls and contact information from his phone some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense will begin with final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip hop"?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make 'conscious hip hop' popular again.
The Fugees and Common have recently enjoyed a revival in the UK with acts such as Akala and Lowkey.

New York City nanny sues couple for 'racist' text
New York City nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mis-sent text from the mother complaining about 'again black'.
The couple denies being racist and calls the lawsuit "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, expressed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day of work in 2016.
"NO WAY SO BLACK", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband."No WAY SO BLACK", wrote Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.

According to the New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her mistake, explaining that their previous nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she was therefore expecting a Filipino.
Mauricewas paid for a day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Maurice is now suing the couple for $350 a day for the 6 months she was hired to intern with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to make them feel like you just don't do something like that",Maurice told the New York Post last Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple defended themselves against the accusation that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid that by offending her they could no longer trust her.
"My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
"We are not racists", her husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who had offended you, even if it was accidental?
Your newborn baby?
"Stop it, you little shit!"
"Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation.'"
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
" added the investment banker.

Paddington publishers feared the public might not be very interested in a talking bear, reveals newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
"Paddington's enormous success, it's very amusing".
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the British broadcaster BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt "bitter sweet" after his death last year.
Paddington, whom she describes as "a very distinguished member of the family", she said, her father was secretly proud of the ultimate success.
"He was a quiet, modest man".
"n Paddington was so real to him,""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

"Paddington, though a creation of his own imagination, "honored the bear himself for his success".

Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that it was expected that she would not make it,said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then came the call from Nad to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
i said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart.

I'll be back with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping slowly got exhausted and left her body.
She had died some time before and this process shut down everything else.
I could just sit there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't whine, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
"I had to keep my head up".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what ordeal she was about to undergo.
"Nobody knew", she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears just kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
"I knew how much he loved her".

Two women who lost loved ones to suicide, make themselves strong to keep others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are posting inspiring messages and phone numbers for people in need to call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
"They always said his smile lit up every room".
"Yet he stopped working before he died because he was in the deep well".
2014 Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
"Don't keep quiet - talk about it".
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling gloomy or depressed or anything", she said.
"n a few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all over the floor on Christmas Day - when the kids unwrapped their presents he didn't look at them or anything.'
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to deal with it: "It's tearing the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins investigation
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for, an inquiry limited in time and scope, then maybe we could create some more unity', said Mr Flake last Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was 'falling apart' amidst a firmly entrenched stalemate within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get their husband elected to the highest court in the country will be severely hampered.
George W. Bush already called members of the US Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and that's how he met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets the report?
Then there's a vote in the Senate, where currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Mike Pence, the Vice President, to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.

According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.


Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.


This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, where they agreed in broad outlines to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

"Without faith in the US action, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and finds him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and found him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview, Saturday, at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical'", said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional during his opening statement, he almost screamed sometimes and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school days.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats", said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House.
"I can say this about him: if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but for the court where he's now serving", she declared.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh evaded questions about revising certain Supreme Court decisions during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to cheer when a hysterical, biased person is now being appointed to the Supreme Court", said Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It's a righteous tirade of months and years of accumulated anger that flows over, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
"I was helped immensely by a woman who was a manager somewhere who told me that she would cry when she got angry, and she developed a method where every time she got angry, she would cry, and she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
"I'm mad". (Laughter)
And then she just kept crying.
"I thought it was brilliant".
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
One of my best memories from a previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I was crying like hell because I was so angry, and an older woman, a cold company manager that everybody was a little bit afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down a stairwell.
"Never let them see you crying", she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
they think you're sad and they're happy they got you on the locker.
Patricia Schroeder, then-Democrat congresswoman from Colorado, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally meaning 'cat's evil' or 'monkey's drag') and withdrew from the race, the deeply disappointed Mrs Schroeder felt that there was no reason why she should not run.
"It was not a thoughtful decision", she told me 30 years later, smiling.
"There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was the subject of a conversation.
nce the campaign was already advanced, she was behind on fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to participate unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who were going to give men $1,000, were only going to give her $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.

How the US-China trade war could turn out in Beijing's favor
The opening salvos of the US-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say a rift between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump,president
The most significant escalation was revealed this week when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (€150 billion) of goods; half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures in kind each time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10% on $60 billion of US goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink its eyes anytime soon.
To bend Washington requires requests to be granted, but publicly bending for the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.

"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could send either country into economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues focused on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to let refugees return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says ready for voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.

"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he says.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.

The UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.

Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.

Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the 'Le Golf National' golf course southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in a row on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europa won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the required 14.5 points to beat the USA.
The star of the US team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling for most of the tournament, dropped his long shot from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, and conceded his loss to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament in its current form began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was sent off by the European team's lowest scorer, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest ranked player in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last match in the Ryder Cup.
Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't cry so fast, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy that I could help,' said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's passing the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods by 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the singles game on Sunday.
"The enormous pride I feel for beating Tiger Woods. I've been following this guy all the time growing up", says 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.

Team USA struggled to find the fairways over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after the disappointing performance of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.

We resisted.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He's a great captain.

I'm gonna work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You gotta take your hat off to your opponent.
"We've been cheated".
Red Glow Update: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows an overall decline in Red Glut concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the USA).
The Committee believes that there are reports of fragmentary increases in Red Glove in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which could indicate a decline in concentrations.
