The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, in total they reach 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous large coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, after the first preliminary results.
Particularly heavy losses were suffered by the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the brink.
In contrast, the electoral leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to previous results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but compared to the last election in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP fell, losing almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst outcomes of these two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially for the People’s Party, which had demanded early elections, this is a truly catastrophic outcome.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
But the voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
Even in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. for a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In the face of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the Freedom Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BZÖ received 11 percent of the votes – the Social Democrats expressed their fears that 1999 could repeat itself when the People’s Party had reached agreements with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) regarding a common government, which even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics, is obviously focusing on this development.
The Greens also entered parliament, but suffered slight losses and slid from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent barrier and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, it could, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, lead to a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
This was stated by the minister in New York after his meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not cleared, then surely, then there will be some cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Despite all this, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted by the prosecution and received a fine, the central government would like the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshis believes it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could therefore apply for release on bail and wait in freedom for his judgment, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had said the same during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to get the convicted person "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said such assistance is already being provided to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest inining good contacts with India, which has a long tradition.
The Indians also admit that,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech news agency ČTK, he reaffirmed before his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists,” he said.
Responding to the question of whether he had received the promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister declined.
“I have been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judges over the rush around the seabed
It approaches an electronic map that depicts Australia and the adjacent maritime areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small spot, lost in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the 30-member team of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it from time to time.
There is work and enthusiasm.
The ocean floor holds a little-known world that is rich in natural resources.
Here you can find oil, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea floor larger than the mainland
The adjacent states today vehemently announced their claim to the new maritime territories.
According to a UN convention, they are exercising their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often enters the sea up to several hundred kilometers away from the shores of a country.
This country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
To put it simply, the continental shelf is considered to be the part of the seabed and its soils that is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the boundaries of the coastal sea, often the boundary of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently struck by the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime territories.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the sea floor extension approved by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, be of invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do so for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as "common heritage of humanity".
No country has a special position anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“But the seabed is not a gold-growing country,” says Mikulka, adding that “individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A portion of the sea floor now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, the Convention granted it, as well as the investors of a few other countries, the status of a so-called “pioneering investor”.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can sell there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division, Rober Sandev, brings such a concrete as a model.
It reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, the fabulous scheme that brought the legend of the Golem to life.
German Special Forces Release Hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts arrived.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to work.
The circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Thus, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the flight staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Service were at the site of the liberation.
German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they saw signs of a violent release.
The Egyptian government has accepted the help offered by Germany to engage them as support forces on the ground.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the German Interior Ministry said.
Attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and their eight Egyptian companions in southern Egypt on September 19.
Following the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until last as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were under the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of his release.
At first, there was no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidayers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House rejects rescue plan
The first house of the U.S. Congress has failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan.
Despite all the appeals from U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority in favour of the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters had desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to endorse the plan, even though it was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
Investors are worried that the bailout plan could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after being known of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
For the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Organizers report increasing bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the travel enthusiasm of Germans remains untouched, according to a study.
On bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies registered a revenue increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, there are already increased bookings for the autumn months.
Thus, the revenue increase of the travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV.
The results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1,200 German travel agencies and calculates for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the United States is in demand, the DRV.
This accounts for about a third of the accounting growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic areas, are sought-after by the Germans.
In particular, package travel is high in the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given the rising cost of energy and food, the costs are “better calculable for the customer than for the individually organized holiday.”
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very well booked, so that sales will again increase compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter pots and celebrities in Designer-Dirndln.
The Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I do not have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailored dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Nearly three minutes on the lawn, the photographers already stumble upon us and scratched the memory cards full - very pleasantly and that at my first visit to the lawn.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Whitewurst equator, the sense of well-being in the costume has so far been limited.
But once you get to the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leather trousers; no one looks disgusted or embarrassingly touched - all completely normal.
Strange gaze at the chocolate banana stand only harvests my Dirndlschürze.
A woman in Munich pointed out to me that I had wrongly bound the shirt: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right forgiven, behind widowed."
Secretly, I freeze my loop from the back to the left.
“Take it,” he said and laughed.
Others make less effort on subtle flirting techniques and wear simple filths with "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked rear toward an uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it “gorgeous,” with a lengthy “ooooo”.
He tells me this after he dropped his previous measure of drinking.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage cane.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbies".
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, healthcare workers are running in groups across the party square, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the row - always four at a time drag a covered suit from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, full back.
Who is in the promille coffin underneath the plane is not seen.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the sanitarians called to me on request and disappeared in the dungeon.
Name of victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been revealed.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of lighthearted driving.
He has now been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial quest.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the travel guides tell you.
The building sits rittlings at the end of the runway with a tower at each corner of the front, making it look like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The entire building collapses.
But once you’re inside the curved ticket compartment, there’s no doubt about the majesty of the project, the westernmost access of which was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late player in the imperialist game, had to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist plans were paralyzed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha railway station.
In 1917, a train of ammunition flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely passed by history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is a policy of approximation.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian split groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To be able to assess the cornerstones of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on the tracks that produced the equalization of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn the back to the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has sparked a lot of distrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a specially crafted, ultramodern stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb surrounded by semi-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers in costumes, both men and women, met to complete the day’s first.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Dress, tie, I’m sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The goal of the party's foreign policy is now to re-integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon,” he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its backland.
Nowadays it must look both east and west at the same time.
There would be neither one nor the other.
She would have to do both.
“But Turkey might at some point,” I asked, “be forced to decide?”
“Turkey,” he said, “did not want to face this decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke with said routinely: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in the broadest sense, Europe as a whole can drive on flat railways eastward towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German rulers, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the ferry stop for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for teens up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already late 20s – we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shapeshifter) represented the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and lasted solely thanks to that man’s inspiration and his enthusiasm for the music he never forgot for years.
How often did death stop us from letting the music speak for itself?
He used to say, “The composer knows what he wants.”
It is all in music.
So sing it!”
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never dominant but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he headed the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to his words, simply "goed home with one or two well-known sheep horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your appeal to William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he re-entered the teaching of economic history at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman Research Scholarship ... while studying at the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author’s note in Woodruff’s book Beyond Nab End, but it’s not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
‘I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me pay attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-space sedan offers a much larger one.
Additionally, there are the technical features that make it even more comfortable to drive and save fuel.
changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before we begin to analyze the new model, one must say that this new jazz will appear six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to initial observations, Honda, compared to other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon when it comes to its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, the country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with approximately half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 Jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to hide the decline in sales in Spain.
In reality, the leaders of the brand hope to close the year with total sales of 22 000 models.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1,6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To this percentage, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell approximately 200,000 models per year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the luggage compartment, which has a system of double load area, reaches up to 339 liters, which is 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation luggage compartment.
It must be stressed that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 litre gasoline engine, because the capacity of the luggage compartment of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional accessories such as leather seats or the possibility to incorporate panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2 litre variant achieves 90 hp at 6,000 turns with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In terms of the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
‘Auto Bee’ That Avoids Collisions
To advance the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is traced back to the shrimp behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of Nissan’s four-layer safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan Safety Shield.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bee, which can see at a angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly uninterrupted in its personal airspace.
To replicate the all-around perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are up to two meters away from the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor, which is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal.
“As soon as an obstacle is noticed, the small robot will imitate the bee’s flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a 90o or greater angle to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference from any other system is that this evasion maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and senior engineer of the project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can neither deviate up or down, nor cross-angle; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to spin its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way as the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from colliding.
This device only needs a couple of seconds each to process the information and to act according to that information.
It does not need to store the information or the intuitive logic of the operations carried out, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage.
This is the first step in the development of technology for immediate collision prevention, a technology that Nissan is predicting to introduce in production cars over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system via satellite to guide you to your destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She is trembling before being burdened with a mortgage.
One must realize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent U.S. citizens from getting caught up in mortgage stories by allegedly payable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: 'Bad Credit Hotel,' it says.
Or, the ‘hotel of bad credit’ or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times if it’s time to ask for no credit.
And most importantly, where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
Certainly she has useful information, but without any details.
This is more a site for the teenagers than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is extended?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley to Invest in MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong drop in its stock market.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks stated that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the price of the stock as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be sold back at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction will be based on a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley stock fell by 6.79% to $23.07 at 17:00 GMT.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing it to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” said Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would be entirely ordinary shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below their market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction in profit by approximately 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares in one year if the latter are exchanged within a given period of time to more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a group spokesman declined to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to account for a solvency rate of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said it had lowered its balance sheet “significantly” since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, who had to watch their exchange rate drop by half as insolvency insurance prices rushed up.
This price dropped on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivor’ of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establish the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third who this Sunday, following the example of his fellow-minded and friends, put forward the plan for a new constitution.
The mission is fulfilled, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the votes in the referendum, 64% voted "yes".
According to these results, 28% voted ‘no’, 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, one vote must be obtained by more than half of the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a census of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for 'Yes' and prophesied to him from 63% to 70%.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa, by the way, had demanded the victory of his constitution.
“The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, congratulating the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales, but also by his Chilean fellow-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence under the Organization of American States (OAS) observation order, referred to a 444-point text to secure the “new socialism” for which the president is committed.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy, leaving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely from oil production by foreign companies and from the currencies that emigrants send into the country.
The project, promoted by the 2006 elected Correa, also grants the head of state greater power, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive four-year terms each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and schooling, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, ending the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
19 hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched an attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
They were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived on board a special aircraft at the military base al-Maza right next to Cairo’s international airport around 15:30.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy the ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘were not paid a ransom,’ Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the scene.
After being captured on September 19 during a SUV safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
There were eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, the organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“Both sides were shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is now, about the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces," he said.
He also denies that a ransom was paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a ground vehicle carrying the kidnappers during a patrol, killing six of them, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, but immediately denied this movement.
The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
The more better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is allocating €3.5 million for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley alone?
For our American neighbors, it is written in their country’s constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all government districts, in mutual coordination.
In Quebec, the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, work hard to study history, save the numerous private archives and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and policymakers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to take advantage of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has fallen into turbulence due to the U.S. financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which, by the way, also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s competition authority representative.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis, which has been ongoing for a year, so decisions now made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, all three states will buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell a portion of its shares, most notably the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis stocks began a steep decline last week, and in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already marked.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The institute’s securities fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the Group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic, according to the management.
According to the management, the $700 billion U.S. bailout package and the uncertainty in the markets caused by it are due to the fall in Fortis stocks.
On Monday, however, the rates increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested person with a tangible offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to reassure – no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fuchs in the Chicken Hall
Due to a person’s drug consumption, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the chickens to the fox," said Richard Dick, the developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies set the fees as well as the amounts to be paid in the event of damage depending on the customer’s health condition, and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance will not be concluded at all.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer's identification number, he obtains the data of the last year and a half from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medications, it would suggest that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do more paperwork, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurer’s point of view, while the aforementioned are not.
For the consultation and processing of the data, their own companies have formed, which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they must do so by law, although omissions have not been punished so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug consumption, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling its use is also becoming more difficult.
While there is its own data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health sector service providers and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another issue is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, because otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the grace of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
EU and India doubling trade
With the European Union and India being each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main theme, along with other global issues, at the Ninth Summit.
Today is also the French-Indian summit, which will focus on cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given more voice and voice in international affairs, member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi’s permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at yesterday’s ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current President of the Council of the EU Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Given the fact that trade in goods increased from $25 billion to $55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally consolidated into one agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be flown.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to balance the current imbalance between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned.
The Doha round should also be concluded, blaming both sides for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is adhering to its energy and climate agenda, which means that pollutant emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be tackled, so they both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister will visit the French capital today, where he will sign a deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped to contract French companies worth €20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is expected to be approved for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to host more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries across the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition and to present more than 403,000 titles.
Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meter exhibition area “Punto Italia”.
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the book fair, where figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers is decreasing in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth group.
Missing Aircraft of Billionaire Steve Fossett Found
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, has been found.
The fragments were found on a high plateau of 3000 meters in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, dismissed his final doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been localized, where a troop has been sent.
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office for Traffic Safety (NTSB) that a crew was sent to identify the aircraft a few hours after the aircraft was spotted: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 after Fossett took off for a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, also in California, near the border with Nevada, some of Fossett’s personal items were found by a couple near their house on the Mammoth Lakes.
These include two passports named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was discontinued a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002 he managed in the sixth run, being the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight with an airplane.
Among his numerous records is a flight of 15445 meters above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you didn’t expect
A SUV that, thanks to its original design and special lines, the exhausting surface and its clear angles, falls out of the conventional schemes.
With this off-road vehicle, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
It is precisely because of its exceptional characteristics that the introduction of the SUV Glk will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum cost, which will be carried out in various phases, which will occupy the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of presenting the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will so apparently emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
Then, with the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new glow is illuminated at different moments in all its details to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is Mercedes’ concern to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field with this advertisement.
But will it succeed to excite the interest of future buyers?
Who are the Italian Hooligans?
They come out of the Triveneto – now they risk a stadium ban
Who are only those 150-200 boys and girls for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? they are part of the grouping "Ultras Italia", which has traveled behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, has not caused serious problems until recently.
There have never been clashes with enemy fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia also encountered these in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: these were removed on Saturday, however, to avoid identification.
The example is the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a collision with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: among those travelling to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already pre-loaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the typhos arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
and fortunately.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation perpetrators, who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and in no case give such behavior the possibility of justification," the Viminal said.
Therefore, “Eyes on above all also looking at the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce.”
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) will gather, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a portion of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Observatory on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chairman of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but without a doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punished in the country where they are committed.
So far, this group has been stuck, but now we need to rethink what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the pips during the hymn of Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but let me, there is a lack of education.
