Although an experimental vaccine has been found that can reduce the death rate from Ebola, no drug has yet shown a clear effect in treating an existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially showed promising results in this area, but official studies have shown it to have less benefit in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control level, meaning that the researchers used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatment options.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but it also provides details that cannot normally be obtained from fossil remains, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top, and pale on the bottom, or had a carotenoid pigmentation.
The find also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rod called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and whiskers - researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and display. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen represents adult plumage, not chickens' down.
The researchers suggested that, although it was a juvenile dinosaur's tail, this specimen had the plumage of an adult, not the plumage of a chick.
A car bomb exploded outside Gaziantep Police Headquarters in Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
The sum of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby star number associated with the plasma stream.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the inversions of the magnetic field.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, a significant portion of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged in a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.

In the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal , Dr. Tony Moll was able to detect XDR-TB (Extra-Rich Drug-Resistant TB).
In an interview, he said that the new strain "is of very great concern because it leads to a very high mortality rate".
Some of the patients could have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers in the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people through close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant TB in the entire TB population still seems low; 6,000 out of the total 330,000 infected at this particular time in South Africa.

The first cases of the disease this season were reported in July.
The vectors are pigs, from which the disease is then transmitted to humans through mosquitoes.
The outbreak prompted the Indian government to take measures such as installing pig traps in the severely affected areas, distributing thousands of mosquito-resistant screenings and spraying pesticides.
The government also pledged several million vials of encephalitis vaccine to help prepare health facilities for next year.
Plans to deliver vaccines to historically worst-hit areas this year have been delayed due to a lack of funds and low priority compared to other diseases.

They are colder during the day than the surrounding surface, and warmer at night.
Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a near-constant temperature, but they correspond to what are deep holes in the ground,  reported Glen Cushing of the USGS's Planetary Geology Department and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally done with low-tech methods: the voter closes in a booth and places a pre-printed piece of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French election laws are quite strict in their system of procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes have been added to them other than those of people who have been allowed to vote and whose votes have been counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict control in accordance with a special procedure.

Although there were three people inside the building when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
The Edinburgh Sheriff's Court subsequently charged Adecco with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting her arraignment and trial, however any witness testimony could be distorted as her popularity has been widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photographs as potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line by publishing photos and other data about the suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment is issued.
The document, according to the leaked information, will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the basis of those that existed before the start of the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics reportedly touched upon include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The arrows that participated in the additional pest control test had to be under the close supervision of the rangers, as this test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and heritage for the Wildlife and National Parks Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone extensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martéi swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (VEC), consisting of nine members.
This is Marteaux's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating of defective iPod devices, resulting in six fires and four minor injuries.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's reporting "very regrettable".
At 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Authority said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are believed to be dead at this point.
The six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had gone to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he started investigating cases of preterm birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was injected, it would enhance the maturation of the baby's lungs during the fetal development period.
State investigators found two unmarked boxes on board the plane on Wednesday, Xinhua reported.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. That's as unique an event as she is. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "The moon was as plague-ridden as I am... perhaps even more plague-ridden... and I love her and I will miss her... and I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard, during the 2010 federal election campaign, expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
The poll showed that 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to compete in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve the pain, as it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water that brought water to Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, because comets have been colliding with Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to more accurately determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
Wembley has no additional transport, no overground trains, and no surface parking or intercepting stations.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of birds in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that due to the mating of the endemic Darwin's hedgehog (Geospiza fortes) with the migratory cactus hedgehog (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched into a thin wire that can be braided and plated, and it can be beaten or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, so-called "face handwriting".
It's called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
The hydrogen ions are protons that have electrons separated from them (hydrogen atoms have one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders in one container and then with clean, wet hands, make a ball out of the mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which is unusual, and then a shell-like structure will form.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Fragments of the sewerage systems have been found in houses in Minoan cities on the islands of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision to some degree.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket must be more than 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed our world in incredible ways, and the most important thing it has done for us is give us a much easier and faster transportation.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more cats of average size, which eat small prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including stray domestic cats) eat and prey on much larger numbers of small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat species does that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called "prides".
The pride consists of one to three related adult males, as well as females and young, up to thirty in number.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves very much like wolf or dog packs - animals that are remarkably similar in behaviour to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four cats are the only ones that have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like the shouting of sentences of unreadable words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they get the chance, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow the tracks of animals and find prey by scent, tracking its movement on the ground by means of their sense of smell.
They have excellent night vision and can move almost unnoticed, so they follow their prey, blend in with their surroundings, and then attack.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from those it had before to become a strong competitor.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look smaller and smaller than the rest of the population.
Over time, thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can't be said to be the same species.
We call this process the formation of species, that is, the emergence of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants feed off the sun by photosynthesis, and they also cast a shadow.
We build our homes and make our clothes from plants, and most of our food is plant-based, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were dotted with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra row of teeth in the beak, so that those who met it in its path had no escape.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was doubled, that he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and that he was a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the Tyrannosaurus could not compete with it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange and unusual dishes served at the feasts, such as boar, peacock, snails and a species of rodent like the solea.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich enjoyed a communal feast, during which they ate on their sides.
The diet of the ancient Romans could not have included the foods that would have entered Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of the gods, one for each of the main shrines, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods' desires in ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurati" were built as elements of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not a big deal.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked large forests, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and moving further west, he discovered Greenland and gave it a name.
But regardless of its discovery, the area was already inhabited by Eskimo tribes.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the peoples, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of the Nations", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map on it.
Although it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "This Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776". The text is written on the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was folded for convenient storage.
So it's likely that the entry was added as a mark.
Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not liberated.
It was under the control of the "Wishist" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, in what was known as Operation Dragone.
In just two weeks, Free French and American forces liberated southern France and moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture, which is carried by a sufficiently large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civil", and is a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of society in a certain way.
Civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a continuous cultural presence and perpetual dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving a corresponding historical record, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States, under the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, with Congress as the sole organ.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no nationwide executive or judicial authority, it relied on the power of the states, which often refused to cooperate and to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to override state tax laws and tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous approval of all the states, but the states were so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians from these regions participate in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest of which is  Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its cluster of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan's origins go back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating the transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Simonosek, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for still photography in the world is 35mm, and this was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analog era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the size of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with small integers) is therefore taken to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The all-too-frequently used and often-ridiculed rule of thirds  is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain degree of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, was the focus of intense attention.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united the nations of Europe despite differences in language and traditions.
Her all-pervasive power touched everyone from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds exist for that purpose.
The center of church power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and wealth had led many to question whether this doctrine was being upheld.
Soon after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated universally accepted international laws, as laid out in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the response to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar response to its unchallenged underwater warfare.
Among most citizens and peoples in the 1920s, such moods as pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
After learning about the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted an offer to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, his former boss, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
Moreover, the fragmentation and instability between the reigns of each dynasty was the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years during the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military actions between many of the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the work opportunities opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true in the military, because ranks are now based on merit, not origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class representatives in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in subjects outside of the world, and he often visited the cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for meditation.
And the cave, which has survived to this day, gives us a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows it exists, because in a cave, you're completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, and from the depths of the cave, only a very small part of this world can be seen and heard.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of the wives of Cheops and his relatives.
The upward movement of the arrow is represented by the symbol V, and the downward movement of the arrow by the symbol , which is represented by a bracket or a square without a bottom.
"Up" means you have to start at the tip and move the bow forward, and "down" means you have to start where your hand is holding the bow and move it back.
The movement of the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while the movement of the bow downwards  is stronger and more forceful.
You can draw your own line, but remember that the line is printed for musical reasons, and it's usually worth following.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The military costs of American imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay most of the costs and interest on the bond loans transferred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the super-profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to form the order.
The period in which these events occurred is commonly called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages replaced the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by a fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually unmovable by cultural or political influence and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the car is the necessary cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically unprofitable for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which is leading to the invention of new treatments for injuries in health care.
Romanticism was in many ways a cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, it shaped customs and culture, which, being in harmony with the place where the society lived, was better than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined throughout the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, valued higher than those offered in Byzantine markets.
And that's when the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the clothes were heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25-30 years.
Styles of their own began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the greatest achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural agriculture is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds from plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with replanting and other relatively simple methods to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were farmers for a living, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they're being held back by society's standards, and allowing such people to define who they are.
There may be differences between subcultures, due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people it consists of.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their belonging through idiosyncratic and symbolic use of style, including fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several regrettable cases where children, due to lack of proper attention, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse, have not had contact with adults during their adulthood.
Some children who become wild are isolated by people (usually their own parents), and in some cases, this is the result of the parents' refusal to accept their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before they run away or are abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is raised entirely by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the physical limits) that are virtually identical to the particular animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding  is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the Microsoft Office Scraper.
The virtual learning scaffolding is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might not be able to do on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should never be raised in an environment where they are not nurtured, cared for and educated, but they are.
We believe foster care is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Patronage education should provide all the needs that were lacking in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialisation" are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contact" were also named by Aimée and McCord (1998) as new areas of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to determine whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting his microexpressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who have brain damage that prevents them from understanding speech can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He hypothesized that animals such as domestic dogs could have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century revealed that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation introduces new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of variations that are emerging.
Segregation and recombination with each generation are causing variations between the two pools.
In the savannah, primates with a digestive system like humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences, such as stunted growth, malnutrition, and, ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins in leaves and beans, but they're poorly digested by primates like us unless they're cooked.
On the contrary, animal food (ant, termite, egg) is not only easily digestible but also a rich source of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
So, given all of this, it's not surprising that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options that are based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (such as water or tea, a popular diuretic) before bedtime, which causes the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force within you, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana way of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhist principle is very simple, it consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
The Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in Kundalini Yoga is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, which is a way of purifying the energy channels, activating the chakras, and achieving enlightenment of the mind.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, the contradictions regarding the system, process and culture led to a rift between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, fighting in the real world, using proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places around the world.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian beachhead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight when some 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after seizing the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
The job of sailors has traditionally been to ensure that a country can move its people and goods, and to prevent the enemy from moving his people and goods.
One of the most noteworthy recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats, usually children or adolescents, which is similar to the more common activity of a shepherd.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the paved roads were only parallel logs, they allowed horses to carry heavier loads and at higher speeds than the slightly more rugged roads of the time.
Slabs were used for a long time to hold the rails in place, but it later became clear that the tracks were more efficient with an iron rail above.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wagon wheels.
In 1767, the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transportation was walking, and humans began walking as early as two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
For their ancestors, the Australopithecus, upright walking was not so common.
Bipedal specialisations are found in Australopithecus remains from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more carefully with our environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the suffering that's still going on.
It's usually like treating the symptoms, but if we want to do more than just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as mankind's scientific and technological advances and its problems have increased with overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing shop.
150 to 200 copies, now known as "Dunlap's leaflets", were made overnight.
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to our day, and we call them birds.
They're often dismissed as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled claws and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind paws like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary digits" or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning right away, and symptoms like vomiting are too common to diagnose quickly.
The best indication of internal poisoning might be an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Read the label for the specific first-aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists formally to designate a group of insects.
This concept is derived from bed bugs, known since ancient times as bed bugs, which are perfectly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both predators and bed bugs are nesting species, adapted to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that MS affects women twice as often as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world is made by using the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused their attention on the ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to autonomously cycle over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacterium using phages, which are viruses.
They did two experiments, labeling phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus and radioactive grey protein of phage.
Mutations can produce a wide variety of outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the segment of genetic material affected, and whether the cells undergoing the mutation are cells of the germ line.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is for those who enjoy nature tours to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to their work, and people whose workplace is in the place they just left pass by.
In this active transport movement, everyone is connected in one way or another to the transport system based on personal cars and supports it.
Now science is showing that the vast hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about those systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they fail every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons for this?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of car traffic because you can't predict the driver's behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between three main variables were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of rail facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to evade predators, find food, and find mates.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Ostriches and finches are the only insects that can't fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a sensible idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids could not be surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments built by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world, and it is also the least populated.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholic.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they are all found in nature in their pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they would go into a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
All matter in the universe is made of very tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came along.
Sadly, as new ways of writing came into existence, the pencil lost its former status and became less useful.
Now people are writing messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard, as more and more new technologies come into use.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to have many protons and neutrons in one nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and then the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the Moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km below the oceans and 100 km below the continents.
It's thinner under the moon's seas and thicker under the hills.
The visible side may have more of the lunar seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava was easier to come up.
Content theories are focused on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate internally as they grow up.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do what they do, and what their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are the Maslow Pyramid of Needs and the Herzberg Two-Factor Theory of Motivation.
There are generally two types of behavior that can occur when managers start managing people who were previously their equals.
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, allocating responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team did and take it upon himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than employees from traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team of leaders to which each participant reports.
Why would organizations go through the laborious process of creating a self-learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently across all functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
In the end, the organization's collective efforts to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that is in the best interest of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and experience accumulation.
Engel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neuroscience provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and it narrows the field of study, and it becomes much more specific.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors in the brain affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are opening our eyes to explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, which looks at machine learning and behavior and the "injecting" of intelligence into it.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Here are some examples that can be cited: monitoring, planning and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, and facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These questions are divided into separate disciplines that aim to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
School field trips are very important for any classroom, and often teachers want to take their students to places that they can't get to by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can explore museums, visit aquariums, or enjoy fine art while sitting with their class.
Putting a virtual tour into the virtual space for everyone to see is also a great way to refresh the memory of the tour and share your knowledge with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year this website is updated, but the old versions are still accessible  they serve as a memorial album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, and although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this tends to change due to audience presence.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to try to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
By blogging, "students gain a better understanding of the world around them". Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by attracting attention (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to spread their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can identify their own position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding areas.
All of these and more make Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are virtually uninhabited.
The population comparison is striking: there are more African Americans in the United States than citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a distinctive continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to this region, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered a route across the Cape of Good Hope from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: all female tourists are encouraged to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It 's also good to wear a ring (just not too expensive to look).
Women need to be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, that women are often persecuted, that they are being held in the hand, and so on.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Merenians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name of Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods like pots, pottery, leather goods, chalices and a whole assortment of trinkets, but this is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a safe place, you should check in advance about any trips outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to see mountain gorillas in the wild.
You can take a mototaxi to Goma, the usual (local) price is 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for the exotic far-away land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger posed by the desert sands.
During the filming of Henry Louis Gates's "Wonders of the African World" on PBS, one of the most important stops was made here.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by the Arabic color, not the African.
Kruger National Park is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and has 14 different ecozones, each of which is a habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for park attendance and visitation.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows you to visit the national parks of South Africa either selectively or all together.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main focus of their attention.
The row of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a sparkling column diagram, highlighted by the water of Victoria Bay.
To see the most beautiful sights of Hong Kong, you must leave the island and head to the coast of the Julong Peninsula, which is opposite.
The largest urban development areas on Hong Kong Island are concentrated on the land on the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonialists took over, and if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining of the mighty jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and reliable Japanese Coaster buses.
The route is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places like Paro (150 knots) and Punakha (200 knots).
The Oiapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapock River and connects the towns of Oiapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters (269 feet) high, and the bridge itself is 378 meters (1,210 feet) long and has two 3.5-meter-wide lanes.
The height of the subbridge gauge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to various indigenous groups, such as the Guaycura and the Payagua, who survived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, then called "the vast province of the East Indies", was founded by Spanish conquerors who clashed with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be watched at other times of the year.
To find out the latest news about the polo matches and where to buy tickets, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the value of one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located on Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted everywhere in the islands.
In remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check in advance with the owners to see which payment method is acceptable.
The Falkland Islands currency is almost impossible to exchange outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving.
Because it is south of the equator, Montevideo is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park's warning: Don't get within 100 yards of bears and wolves, and within 25 yards of any other wildlife!
No matter how meek they appear, bison, moose, bear, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors get injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so please respect their privacy.
Also, remember that the odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid cooking or carrying smelly food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All but one British cruiser sank, and about 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of the supreme leader Tupua Tamse Lealop III.
There are many beaches, as Oakland is located on the shores of two harbors, and the most popular beaches are located in three districts.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor area) is washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the pohatuva.
In central Auckland, where the prestigious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier's are located in the Waitemat Bay, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are spread out.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste.
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better to transport.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still apprehensive, bottled water is not difficult to find.
Australians don't understand the concept of "flat white". "Little black" is espresso, cappuccino is served with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian standard, and the fruit juices, while expensive, are of excellent quality.
There are many trips to the reef year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes are rare on the reef.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The Kubomeduza occurs near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April, but occasionally outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and swim away.
The crested crocodile is not active in the ocean, and its main habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveler to avoid worrying about where to stay when arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation through travel agents, such as camping sites.
Travel agents usually sell packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include a flight and a hotel stay.
They can also keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you'll need to arrive early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages may be over, there may be some areas of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin layout, as walking on ice can make a rather eerie noise that can disturb the sleep of the most sensitive people.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city tours, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (exact conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to ensure that visitors spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them in the hotel.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but getting drunk is a mental state, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive in high-altitude areas or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
The friction on the ice and snow is low, and you cannot drive as well as on the normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to be trapped can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall, blizzards, condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic is almost continuous year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage refers to a land journey to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, often get close to the cars, so even with the usual equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush exploration", "hiking safari" or "walking safari") consists of a hike lasting from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympic Games twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have booked your 2020 tickets and accommodation before the announcement of the postponement, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels provide an iron and an ironing board for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron on hand or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing an ironed sock, you can try a hair dryer if it's available.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which can lead to shrinkage or, in very rare cases, to burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
Some places will boil water for a minute, while others will require several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, you may want to consider buying water in sealed bottles and from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, produce venom, or transmit infection.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can cause injury or death to humans are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain points without taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Pointe Marion and Fermon has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, often passing through isolated, backwoods and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on your guard: steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns are common.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than anything else.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone service here is much better than in many other parts of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it's very plentiful and varied, and it's similar to the pastry of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit baking is widespread, apple baking is done year-round, and cherries and plums appear in the summer.
Almonds, groundnut, and other tree nuts are often used in German pastries, and the popular cake often goes well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but filling, flour-based confection, try what, depending on the region, are called pancakes or donuts with filling.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the content of the liquid, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is used extensively in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in South India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a catch-all term used to denote the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without specification, the term most often implies food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simple, spicy dishes. The Javanese preference is for flavorings such as peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle's legs are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there may be safety issues, as there is a chance of getting stuck in the leg.
If a horse has thrown a rider, but his foot is caught in the stirrup, the running horse can pull him back, and to minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.

Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also known as backcountry, ski-touring or ski-hiking.
This is related to, but does not usually include, hiking to the summit and then descending unprepared slopes, as downhill skiing requires harder skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski trail is a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover a few more distances than you would on foot, but you can only reach that speed on a cross-country ski in the extremely rare case that you don't have a heavy backpack and a ski slide.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to apply for visas and passing passport controls multiple times.
But the Schengen area is functioning as one country in this respect.
Once in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to go through the passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each of the Schengen countries separately, which saves you time and money, as well as paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is an antique, but some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.

The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay for the privilege (or better yet, get your company to pay for you).
However, it's not cheap at all. Based on experience, you'll pay four times the cost of economy class for business and eleven times the cost of first class!
It usually doesn't even make sense to look for business class discounts or first class for direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge accordingly.
