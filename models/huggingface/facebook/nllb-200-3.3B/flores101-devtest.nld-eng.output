One experimental vaccine appears to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, but so far there are no drugs clearly suitable for treating existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, initially showed promise in the field, but official studies showed it had less of the benefits that it could have in preventing people from dying.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, so scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatment methods with it.
The U.S. Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands the need for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.

Not only does this prove the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur coat was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development, since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as a hook.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or for appearance. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this specimen actually shows adult feathers and not the dons of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the coat of an adult and not the plumage of a chick.

In France, voting has long been a very low-technology affair: voters go into a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they are voting for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter, then the voter slips the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot paper.
The process is relatively narrowly defined in the French electoral law.
Since 1988 ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the start of the voting and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the process, and volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman's rapists have been arrested and have found her mobile phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She's in custody pending charges and trial, but the eyewitness account may have been doctored because her story was published multiple times.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland operates differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photos could be detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists are playing a dangerous game when they publish photographs of suspects.'
Crown Office has overall charge of prosecutions and has told journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been made.
Sources say the document refers to a settlement of the dispute, something the Palestinians wanted to do based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of an agreement, but the PA is only willing to be present for five years.
The researchers in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest rangers, who monitored the trial and evaluated its effectiveness.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's shooting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of park preservation and heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have had extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
Martelly's gotten a CEP five times in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the dismissal of the former National Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to bring the country to new elections.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due to take place since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of defective iPods overheating, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of the 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating that the company called "not serious".
"Very regrettable", was the ministry's response to Apple's delay in the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 0719 local time (Friday 2119 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former police officer from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and at least six fatalities have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's example and entered the medical profession.
Trained as a midwife, he started work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins spent his spare time researching premature births.
His research showed that the maturation of fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, and Luna passed away on the night of the two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as me... maybe weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Outgoing Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled supported this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Twenty-nine percent of respondents thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31 percent said it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medalist swam the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was called into question because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because it's banned at the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water on Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially since the earth has long since been struck by comets.
Cuomo (53) was sworn in as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and chatter".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, according to the FAA, saving millions of tons of fuel each year for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technologies, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better and provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no additional transport and no overground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the car parks and the P&R are not accessible on the premises.
A possible lack of transport made it more likely that the match would be played behind closed doors and without fans.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday looked at the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations, a process thought to take much longer because it took longer to cross a native Darwin's finch, the Middle East ground finch, with an immigrant Cactus ground finch, the Española ground finch.
Gold can be worked into many shapes. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a narrow thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be forged or rolled into plates.
After it has been made very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the carbon juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders, wet and clean your hands, and make a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of envelope.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Sewage waste has been found in houses in Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
In addition, there were toilets in ancient China, Egypt, and Persia, and in Roman times they were often part of a public bathhouse, where both ladies and gentlemen gathered in mixed groups.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will beam it back to the satellite.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and images.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a huge rocket that is over 100 feet [30 m] long.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is a much easier and faster way to transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result.
There are medium-sized cats amongst the medium-sized prey, from hares to antelopes to deer.
In addition, many small cats (such as free-ranging domestic cats) hunt small prey in large numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
Their success stems from the idea of a niche, a special job that each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other large felines), and are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and have five times the traction power of a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
A tiger does not roar with full force like a lion. It is more like a sentence of growling.
The ocelot's favorite food is small animals, such as monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and it hunts almost exclusively animals much smaller than itself.
Scholars suspect that ocelots use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by sniffing the ground where they have been.
They have night vision, so they can see very well in the dark and they move very inconspicuously.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the large population from which they originated (for example, by moving across a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, different resources and different enemies are introduced, so the new population must change or adapt to face the competition.
Because they still require the same adaptations as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other populations.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, and it simply involves the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Through photosynthesis, plants obtain nutrients from the sun, and they provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, and we eat plants, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at the time, and had nothing to fear from anyone but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning that nothing or no one could escape it.
It's not certain, but it's possible that its tongue was forked, and it ate turtles, large fish, other mosasaurians, and perhaps even its own kind.
In water races, nothing was safe from the attacks; even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including porcupines, peacocks, slugs, and a type of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
There was another difference, too: Poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet where they sat on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals did not include foods that came to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was considered to be the god's own house.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a back room that was restricted to priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family was often irregular.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were little more than a street-side counter; stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, and therefore timber was very expensive.
According to Norse legend, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on his way west and named it after himself.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimo tribes living there at the time.
Although all of them were 'Scandinavian' countries, the personalities, the royal family, customs, and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark, and Norway were very different from one another.
You might think after watching the movie National Treasure that there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There's something written on the back, but it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although no one can be sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage in earlier times.
It therefore appears that the indication was simply added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy France, and these were Frenchmen who had joined the Germans in 1940, and so were marching with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France in just two weeks, and then they were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people living and working together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the precursors of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed down through generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced distribution.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave behind no relevant historical evidence, and thus are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolution, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation formed a weak central government, consisting of a congress only.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, as there was no national executive or judicial branch, and it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to carry out all its decisions.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and interstate tariffs.
First, all the states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be amended, but the states did not take the national government seriously enough to make their representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world after Germany, having won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (with the largest island Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands Japan has, Japan is often referred to geographically as a 'peninsula'
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when sailors from Europe passed by the island and named it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC settled in southwestern Taiwan as a base, where the VOC adopted the indigenous grain production processes and employed Chinese laborers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Built of three large structures, Machu Picchu consists of the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of Three Arms.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they used to be.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the work is still going on.
For example, the most commonly used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which was the common film format in the later analogue film era.
These are still produced today, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35mm film is actually 36mm wide, at a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would then be 3:2.
Many common classifications (e.g. APS-like classifications) are equal to or a close approximation of this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and which many find ridiculous, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church came under fire.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity united European states, despite differences in language and customs.
From the king to the common citizen, his all-pervasive power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the church has funds for this purpose.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this power-money relationship led many people to question whether this principle was being followed.
Britain imposed a naval blockade against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, as it was no longer possible to supply vital supplies to military and civilians, but this blockade did violate generally accepted international law, which has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has laid mines in international waters, making entire portions of the ocean impassable, even to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestrained undersea warfare.
During the 1920's, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After World War I, governments wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each phase of China or each ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the different dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
At that time, fierce wars were fought between different nobles who were fighting for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution had major social and political consequences, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the view that the country belonged to its inhabitants rather than a single leader.
After the revolution, jobs were available for all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and qualified candidates could succeed.
The same goes for the military, where the ranks are no longer based on class but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolutionize.
Muhammad was intensely concerned with supernatural matters, often going to a cave for meditation that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Nour.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on a mountain peak on the north side of Mecca and is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find it, because once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
All that is visible is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C. and is one of the many great pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or 'Pyramids of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the great sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a notch or a square with a missing bottom.
Above means to start at the tip and push the string away, below means to start at the arch (the place where your hand holds the string) and pull the string.
An upward movement usually produces a quieter sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to sketch your personal characters, but remember that the printed dashes are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a group of market ladies were behind the departure of the death-scarred Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by howling and threatening mobs that threatened the royal couple.
The crowd's actions forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles to a terrified queen.
The cost of the war of US imperialism in the Philippines has been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to finance much of the cost and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism was based in large part on the enormous profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the history of Europe in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Early Middle Ages were followed by the High Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which usually ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide assortment of ideas in practice: from technology supply or technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general views: that the development of technology follows a trajectory that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the automobile automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass car ownership also causes a greater number of accidents on the roads and this leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care to be able to repair the human body.
Romanticism was a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped the individual, and over time, geography gave rise to customs and cultures that created a harmonious society, superior to arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe, just as Paris is the fashion capital today.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 A.D. to about 1100 A.D.
The empire's status declined in the 12th century, largely because the crusaders returned with silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine culture from the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west lagged 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, a style of clothing began to develop in Western Europe, and one of the major developments was the result of the Crusades, when people began to use knots to fasten their clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually biological, that uses stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture may be defined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or any combination of these.
Members of a subculture often indicate which group they belong to by means of a particular symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave, and in the jargon they speak.
One of the most widely used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who, through neglect, setbacks or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some wolf cubs have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents would not accept the child's severe mental or physical limitation.
Unmanageable children may have experienced severe child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A feral child not raised by humans may display behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that cared for the child (within its physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning is supposed to make education simpler and more interesting, but scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, for example a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, and a tutor is a form of support, but so is the Microsoft Office paper clip guy.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory aids and explains procedures that may be difficult for students to understand without help.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, including neglect, abuse, and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where they are not cared for, and where they cannot develop, but this is happening.
We consider the foster care system a safe zone for these children.
The idea is that foster care provides a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
The foster care must meet all the needs that were neglected in the previous home.
The Internet is merging elements of interpersonal and mass communication.
The different characteristics of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal engagement' and 'persistent relationships' when they examined audience responses on websites.
Using video recordings has led to remarkable breakthroughs in interpreting microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can detect a lie by looking at micro-expressions alone.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, described how it is that people who cannot understand that speech because of brain damage can accurately gauge its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as domestic dogs, also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination are used to vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can survive on the savannah but find it difficult to obtain the amino acids needed from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, failure to take it into account can have serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition and, eventually, even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless they're cooked, they're hard for primates like us to digest.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a very high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep disruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and fall back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively gentle alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, and that way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking plenty of fluids before going to sleep (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), which will make you have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person has is in proportion to the amount of stress a person is carrying in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present.
Anyone can lighten their mind, and the only thing that's stopping you is your own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this form of Buddhism is expanded with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a pursuit of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightenment energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as its focus, and with the help of visualizing various deities, energy channels are opened, chakras are activated, and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in World War II, a partnership was established between the USSR and the United States, and when the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies were facing each other for two years after the war ended, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years and proxy wars were fought on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense forces held out only until 17 September 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were overturned overnight, however, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts, after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Cargo shipping is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, the Navy's job is to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while hindering the ability of the enemy to transport people and goods.
The US was trying to get troops and supplies across the Atlantic to the British, and this North Atlantic campaign of World War II is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic with the help of U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen to Germany had the Allies failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran some 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began keeping them so that they could always easily obtain hair, meat, milk and hides.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other pasture, and were then guarded by goatherds, as the more familiar sheep-herder was often a child or younger.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the horse-drawn railways were only a rails of planks, the horses had to run faster and tougher than on the somewhat difficult roads of the day.
Early on, cross beams were used to hold the rails in place, but gradually it was realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the standard practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were laid.
The first form of transportation we know of is walking, and humans started walking upright about two million years ago, when Homo erectus first appeared.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
And in the fossil record of the Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, we find two-legged specialization, and the Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement, or even take action to alleviate some future suffering.
In many cases it is like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological advances of human society have evidently changed the earth dramatically, and overpopulation and extravagant human living have added to the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's printing works a few blocks away, and was signed by the President of the Continental Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary of State, Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 were made overnight, these are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon first gave the document's public reading on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, while another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Flight Scripts are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that there is still a dinosaur species alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind us of a dinosaur.
They have claws and scales on their legs, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulation of data encoded in binary numbers forms the basis of almost all computers used today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that they cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medication or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal intoxication.
Check the label for specific EHBO instructions for that exact poison.
This group of insects is formally called "beetles" by entomologists.
This term is derived from an ancient similarity to bedbugs, which are insects that can parasitize humans quite well.
Both red-eared wasps and bedbugs are nest-bound, adapted to live in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in adults of both young and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or that of their child, to have a large baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In an adoption, the parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works by means of the scientific method is the primary goal of science, and this method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experimentation; experimentation is a test to rule out one or more potential assumptions, to question and observe, as a guide for scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less as knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioral rhythm detection there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live by periodic rhythms, and these are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even when no external signals are being given.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important clues that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted: in one experiment, the DNA in the phage was tagged with a radioactive phosphorus, and in the other experiment, the protein in the phage was tagged with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells are hereditary, while other mutations can cause cells to die or to develop cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit natural areas because they want to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
The sites include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, parks, and ecosystem studies.
One example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutan tongues in Borneo.
Every morning, people from small villages drive to their workplaces and pass people whose workplaces are in the village they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that this huge carbon economy is no longer keeping the biosphere in the stable state that allowed human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about it.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are comparatively rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day, are transport engineers just incompetent, or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers are quite predictable, which means that traffic flows have some consistency and that there is something to be said for this in mathematical terms.
The three core characteristics have been linked to better reflect traffic flow: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships facilitate the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape predators and more efficiently to find food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide in a greater number of small places from predators.
At present, only dragonflies and ladybugs can't fold their little wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system revolved around the earth, and so did the sun (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the world's second largest and longest river, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, six miles wide in places.
At least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the sea from rivers comes from the Amazon.
The mainstream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and its water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City, with a population of about 800, is the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of official communication and law in Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone who lives in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People have known the most basic chemical elements, like gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they're all found in nature and it's fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they transition into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is simply a combination of at least some metals, and as you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have come into existence, the pen has been degraded and is used far less.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a sharpener.
You might wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard once something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart pushing up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they break apart at the slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner below the maria and thicker below the highlands.
There may be more marshes on the side, because the crust is thinner there, and lava could have been more easily brought to the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's motivation-hygiene theory.
Generally speaking, two approaches emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues: one approach is to try to position themselves as equals.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and take disciplinary action, to hold evaluation meetings, to delegate and to address people on their responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, he or she becomes an unrecognizable individual, who feels compelled to change everything the team has done, and wants to take it all for himself.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
Often this behaviour leads to a rift between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are often more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to embark on the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?
Creativity and ingenuity are revealed when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
To enable innovation in an organisation, management must foster a culture that places innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning at the heart of the organisation.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with a continuum-based approach.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, allowing the area of study to be narrowed and more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As more and more new technologies are introduced, we are learning more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This gives us a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that will help us understand more about the processes of our mind.
AI may immediately resemble science fiction to most people, but it's also a critical part of computer science, used in research on machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is a field of study of AI.
Some examples are management, planning, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many trips are planned for each class, and often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technological developments have made it possible for students to take virtual excursions from the classroom to view artifacts in a museum, to look inside an aquarium, or to see beautiful works of art.
Virtual sharing of a field trip is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned each year and previous versions of which are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better, often with poor grammar and spelling at the beginning, but that quickly changes as they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve the writing and avoid criticism.
By blogging, 'students are also forced to learn more about the world around them.' The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
When used properly, blogs can 'help students develop analytical and critical thinking skills; by actively engaging in online discussion, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time form their own views on certain issues' (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's bilingual capital is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
To the south, you'll find Niagara Falls, and further north, you'll find the beautiful, unspoiled Muskoka and more.
This is the kind of thing that makes Ontario, in the eyes of outsiders, typically Canadian.
Further north, large areas are rather sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population equation that may surprise many: There are more African Americans in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located off the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent countries or are linked to France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India, marking the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region is bordered on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean and on the north by the Sahel region.
Women: Female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not that is true.
It also helps to change rings (not too expensive looking rings).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to behaviour which they consider intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences don't speak for themselves!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name of Casa Branca, but after an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad, and the Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items such as tagines, pots, leather goods, water pipes and other trinkets, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, before visiting outside Goma, check the state of affairs regarding the fighting going on in North Kivu province.
In addition, the city is the base for the climb of Nyiragongo volcano and is home to some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking trips in Africa.
The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short trip.
Timbuktu is relatively inaccessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a pauper city, although its reputation as a tourist hotspot and its airport make it a popular tourist destination.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to desert storms.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS show Special Wonders from the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is different from the rest of the country because it has an Arab feel to it rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, the border with Zimbabwe in the north and the southern border is the Krokodil River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various species of wildlife are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entry fees.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and many tourists consider it the most important place.
The number of tall buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a sparkling bar chart that is made visible by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
The vast majority of the people of Hong Kong Island live very close together on the reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers settled, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world, stretching from the coastline 80 kilometres (50 miles) into the Indian and Bengal hinterland.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part within India's borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are more than just mangrove swamps  they also boast some of the last mighty patches of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is marshland and swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 axishertens.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (across the river), most departing between 6.30 and 7.30 am, mainly in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days in advance, since the regional buses are often full.
In most neighborhoods, there are small Japanese Coaster buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis can be used to travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French Guiana city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the building is 378 meters long and has two passages 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs offices are expected to be ready for use.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group, living in what is now eastern Paraguay, as semi-nomadic hunters and self-sufficient farmers.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly called 'the great province of India,' was established in the 16th century when Spanish colonists encountered the native population.
A three-century colonial period under the Spaniards followed.
Since its founding in 1537, Asunción has preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions are also held here at other times of the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP), which is approximately equal to one British Pound (GBP).
There is only one bank on the islands, in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store, where you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley you can often pay with credit cards and American dollars.
In the remote islands, you may not be able to pay by credit card, but you probably can pay in British and American currency.
Change your money before you leave the islands, because Falklands currency is very difficult to change outside the islands.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, it's winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures of up to 30°C can be expected in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rainfall level remains about the same throughout the year, with no recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bear, and just about any other large animal can attack you, no matter how tamed they may seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia, and the city of nearly 40,000 is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor, a situation that later became known as the infamous stalemate.
All but one British battleship was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed in a violent non-confrontational meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, particularly because of Auckland's two harbours, the most popular being located in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch north to south along the Great Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
Nearly all of these are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have pohutukawa trees to provide shade.
At Waitemata's Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good supply of shops along the coast.
Number One is the main local beer that is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be found, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can be safely drunk, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A flat white is a strange concept for Australians, black coffee is espresso, cappuccino has lots of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian quality, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're great.
Reef tours are held year-round and injuries from these tours are rare.
Nevertheless, seek professional advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube-shaped whales occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton, and they don't normally live in the ocean.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation, such as a camping spot, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes even flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think about the offer a little longer or if you need to obtain documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you should do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those attending music festivals choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember this: Even after the music on the main stage has ended, other parts of the festival grounds may be playing music late into the evening.
For families with young children, some festivals have special camping areas.
Be sure to keep an eye on your cabin when crossing the Baltic in winter, as the ice-ice draft makes a lot of noise if you're too close.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city.
Casinos usually strive to make the most of the time and money spent by guests, and windows and clocks are usually not present, and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to keep them from leaving.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know that it is very important to stay sober.
When climbing high mountains or driving over mountain passes, be aware that there may be snow or ice and that the temperature may be extremely cold.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and the driving is different from asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short period of time to become trapped.
Also, visibility may be affected by falling or falling snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many lands and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest African tourist attraction is safari, which for many visitors is the highlight of their trip.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to view the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good viewing.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you need binoculars, otherwise you're not likely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loop safari') involves walking for several hours or days in succession.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you've already booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you could be in a pinch.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies will no longer be valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and a ironing board available. You can often borrow these things, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear socks that have been ironed, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the dust does not get too hot (this can shrink the dust or, in extreme cases, scorch it).
There are a number of ways to purify water, some of which are effective in addressing specific risks.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in other areas, boiling water for several minutes is necessary.
Not all filters are equally effective, so if in doubt, it is best to drink water from a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues that are not present in their own country.
Bugs can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping means that you can buy goods in certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save substantial amounts of money on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected by the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, and you often drive through desolate back country, which makes this one challenging drive.
If you're not used to driving on dirt roads, keep your head on the ground, you'll come across many steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp curves.
The posted maximum speeds are markedly lower than in previous and successive areas - usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it's more important to stick to them than ever.
Surprisingly, you have a lot more range here than in other corners of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste great and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, as are the pastries of its southern neighbour, Austria.
You will see many fruit pies, and throughout the year the pies include apples, and in the summer months, cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and they taste great with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some called in the Berliner region, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
To make a curry, you need spicy and spicy ingredients, combined with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine encompasses dishes from 17,000 islands and is an umbrella term for a variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to food originally from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese flavorings are nuts, peppers, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.
Riding pins support the rider's feet and hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but they can also pose safety problems because a rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but his foot hangs in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety braces that allow a saddle to release a saddle leather when pulled back because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is Chile's most popular climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
The mountain peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Winter descending sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular, and you slide down a snow-covered slope with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan entire vacations around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginnings of skiing date back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Noren.
Backpacking with skis: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it's like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is often done on steep terrain, and you need a lot of more rigid skis and boots for that.
You can think of the ski route as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover greater distances than by walking, but it is rare to reach the speed of cross-country skiing on paved trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you are in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a new passport control.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique.Some tax offices give the definition of antique to goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition may vary by location, for example, in North America the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify craft products as antiques, despite the fact that they are newer than comparable mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important way of life for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also very important for many other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but they subsisted on fishing, hunting and such, using reindeer mostly as pack animals.
Many Sámi today work in modern occupations.In Sápmi, the Sámi area, tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is used mainly by non-Roma, but is also often considered offensive because of its associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of Roma.
If there is a travel advisory for the country you want to go to, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can also consult other authorities in addition to your own government, but their advice is directed to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often present a fleeting, general and extremely simplistic picture compared with other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event that can cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather events can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of weather events, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
The effects of severe weather include strong winds, hail, heavy precipitation, and forest fires, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, hailstorms, and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather events.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks posed by severe weather conditions in their area, as these can also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country considered a war zone should be professionally trained.
A search for "hostile environment courses" on the Internet will likely yield the address of a local business.
A course normally covers all the issues set out in this paper in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing, lots of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles on wilderness survival, but there are few publications on war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return journey.
There is a great deal of variation in the way governments want to issue passports that do not include a gender (X), or in the way they want to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
Furthermore, security searches have become much more extensive since September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can be assured that they will not go through this scan with their privacy and dignity intact.
Muistroms are the recurrent flow of waves that break off a reef or similar object and flow onto the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return current is in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths are due to fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which might be impossible.
When you've escaped the strong current, swimming back is so cool.
Try to focus on a spot where you won't get caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might as well wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less intense "honeymoon feeling"), it lasts longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adjusting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you found that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adjust to a new country.
Patience and understanding are not usually expected of travelers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the neighborhood.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of vendors and tourists is always audible here. The story of light and sound is like that of a book.
The Sphinx is the background and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have been claimed by several countries since then, and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception, where you'll find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is on the southern side of the peninsula, bordering Bellingshaus Lake.
Here the mountains of the peninsula cross into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) Mount Ellsworth range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4,892 metres (16,020 ft).
A satellite phone may be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone, since you must be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, and for expeditions where external data and communication is required.
Your local telephone provider can provide you with more information on how to connect to this service.
It's becoming more popular for people who plan to spend a year off to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers take advantage of this to take a gap year before university without detrimental effects on their education.
Often, enrolling in a foreign course during a gap year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, tuition fees are payable for enrolment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a fantastic sailing destination, and the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the islands off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagoes on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, but smaller boats or even a kayak can give you a totally different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their leisure time that the ratio of boats to people is one to seven or eight.
The figure is similar to that of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, and is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
You can spend several full days in the historic site and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from many fears that other people have.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to allay a fear that comes from the unknown or from not having control of the plane.
Courier companies are generously compensated for delivering items quickly, and time is often very important when business documents, merchandise, or spare parts are needed for necessary repairs.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but other routes and smaller companies became more difficult.
If they're shipping things by air, it can take days on some routes before they're unloaded and through customs.
Only if it was checked in could it be processed more quickly, and according to airline regulations, there must be a passenger accompanying the bag, and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a bag of money for this privilege (or better yet, have your employer do it for you).
But this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times for business class, and about 11 times for first class.
It is usually not worthwhile to look for discounts on business class or first class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know full well that there is a group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably, and airlines are charging corresponding costs for this.
Chişinău is the capital of Moldova, and the Romanian language is the main language spoken, but Russian is also widely used.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was beset by ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognised by UN members.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the predominant religion in Moldova.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of İzmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping malls covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the old mosques and churches, but still the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special octagonal church.
Interesting marble sculptures of pigeons are on a number of tombs near the church.
If you have half an hour, you should definitely look around this village.
To the north is the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to outsiders after Lord Byron spoke highly of its beautiful monuments.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop in Cabo da Roca.
Also head north and see the beautiful Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (a temple complex), where internationally famous Marian apparitions have taken place.
Remember that you are visiting not just a mass grave but also a place of almost unmeasurable significance to a large part of the world's population.
Many of the men and women who survived their time here are still alive and many of them have loved ones who were murdered or worked themselves to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
During your visit, please show all appropriate respect, solemnity and dignity, and do not trivialize the Holocaust or Nazism.
Do not damage the site by marking or graffitiing the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority can understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
Yet, most of the signs are in Catalan, since that is the first official language according to the law.
However, Spanish is widely used in public transport and other services.
Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unscheduled interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The people of Paris are known to be selfish, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just a misconception, it doesn't hurt to put on your best foot in Paris and behave like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-educated).
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly fades when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested and this forested area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine trees, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying height differences.
This area is also home to a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat and the rooster, in addition to all sorts of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt up to the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually a woman's scarf is given to her when she arrives unprepared at a monastery, but if she brings her own, with its bright colors, the monk or nun standing at the entrance will smile kindly at her.
On the other hand, men should wear pants at least above the knee.
You can borrow them from the store at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time, so you may not feel comfortable with them.
Like many other Mediterranean regions, Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil extensively.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, especially during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to taste, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Nouns, like Sie, which means you, always have an upper case at the beginning, even if they're in the middle of the sentence.
In this way you make a principal distinction between a number of verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or an adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so pronunciation is generally not a problem.
The most important ones are the "c" and the "g", whose pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, you have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means love, while carro means car.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and usually regular grammar.
Reading this introduction to grammar will teach you much about Persian grammar and help you to understand sentences.
It is quite logical that if you know a Romance language, it is easier for you to learn Portuguese.
But people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar to this that you don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, serving as museums or educational attractions.
Light pollution wasn't as big a problem back then as it is now, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the viewing of cherry blossoms, and it's been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers, and that's where the concept came from.
Japan's first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor and were only for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you should resist the urge to remove even just one species.
If you collect samples while visiting a landscaped garden, you will be immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate, and almost everything is available upon arrival.
But if you are in the "high tropics", but a few degrees north of the equator, you experience both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the surviving burial site of the Biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take actually goes into Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good holiday destination.
For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting towns along the Danube, or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
In addition, nonbelievers in Christian lands and non-Christians throughout the world have adopted many traditions associated with the holiday.
There's a tradition where you stay up all Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often celebrating a midnight clock-clock feast in honor of Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands have come here by swimming, flying or floating.
The long distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man first set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
During winter, the Arctic and Antarctic regions experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you will be able to see the aurora borealis, since the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated, so light pollution is not often a problem, which means you can also enjoy the starry skies.
The Japanese work environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Put on his standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by last name or function name.
The workplace is a place where unity is crucial, where the focus is on group performance rather than individual performance.
Employees often need the approval of their supervisors before they can make a decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions of the supervisors without thinking.
