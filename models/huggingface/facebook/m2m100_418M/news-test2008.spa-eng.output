Inflation slides in food
The accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the vertiginous growth of food prices.
The price rise in November has been higher than expected in the 13 Eurozone countries, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, the EU Statistics Office based in Luxembourg announced.
Official forecasts gave as likely only 3 percent, Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian emitter banks, did not cut the basic interest, with the pretext that the decrease, along with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the trap 22: “there is to negotiate” on inflation so that subsequently it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, beat the record of twelve years; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the Eurozone has led to food and energy prices.
The quotations at the end of the wheat increased by 88 percent and the soya quotations reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, it had to pay a lot more in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching black gold almost $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1% to 2.5%, while in 2009 it will decline to 1.9.
According to analysts, the annual inflation will remain around 3 percent over the next 3 or 4 months, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to double the interest rates during the year 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, for the beginning of December the support of the Alliance of Young Democrats increased significantly, reaching its highest level since 2002, as the Gallup never before experienced such a low level – 13 percent – in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the secure electors of the parties – due to the greater firmness of the opposition electors – would mean a support of more than two-thirds (a 71%) against the support of a fifth for the socialists (a 20%).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not reach the necessary limit to have some parliamentary scan: their support within the total population is one-two percent.
Among the secure voters there are one percent more supporters in both bands.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the lower point before – it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country’s economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believes the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic as to the change of their own economic situation.
As for the next year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only one tenth of them expect improvement.
In December, 71% of respondents, a figure higher than any previous Gallup survey, estimated that the President of the Government plays badly than his functions.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust a lot in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has the support of 38 percent of respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Alliance of Young Democrats.
One of the indicators of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the dissatisfaction experienced in front of the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the disturbances of October last year a 35 percent estimated it would be desirable to keep the Government and the Head of Government in power, currently this proportion is only a 20 percent, while the relative majority (a 33 percent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of the respondents to the question about participation replied that they would participate safely and another 20 percent said that they are likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "one general elections to be held this Sunday" would participate safely only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believes likely their participation.
74 per cent of the population would disapprove the payment of the fees for studies, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of the hospital care.
If we observe these proportions only among the secure participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89% of voters would refuse the introduction of the rights to study, the payment for medical consultations and the hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintuplicated its prices
The average price level rise of 16 percent wasined by the Budaörs gold trade triangle hypermarkets, with the difference that this year the VAT has not increased.
Posts by Napi Gazdaság
This year also increased by an average of 16 percent in the Budaörs gold trade triangle the Napi daily usual Christmas cottage, but in all hypermarkets a growth was much higher than the thousand HUF.
As in December last year the prices in food supermarkets had already "disappeared", there was no dramatic percentage incentive compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously terrible for consumers the fact that what last year they could buy at a price much below the nine thousand HUF, today they can’t do it even for ten thousand.
Napi's chest in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest cost was 10 573 HUF.
(In the year 2003 that canast cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong rise was recorded in the peanut butter, nuts and amapola seeds.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although at Auchan we found also a kilogram of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not lower the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of the Coca-Cola with a two-litre redimible bottle was less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the bottle price, was just 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's cottage it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to the Christmas prices last year, Cora increased by a 15, while Tesco and Auchan with close to a 18 percent of the prices that are listed in the Napi box.
Comparing the values of the most expensive box last year with the cheapest box this year, the difference has been 12 percent, as growth between the cheapest box last year and the most expensive box this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during Christmas last year in prices the increase of VAT was felt.
Just this process was the one that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to make a decision on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi casta reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, that the most expensive was higher by 1720 HUF to the value registered in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was just a 844 HUF.
This year such extremes did not occur, since the highest price now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic price growth was recorded in less than 20 months, in the hypermarkets the price of first-need consumer goods increased by more than 30 percent.
(But this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some first-need foods recorded in the 12-month interval a price increase greater than 30 percent.
So for example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of egg.)
According to Napi’s box, in this latter case this seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst of the cases just a 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, which could impose the drastic price rise even on multinational companies.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trade triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our collected experiences, most consumers from the three stores visited, no longer are interested in prices.
Of all products they buy large amounts, carrying by palettes the preserved food.
On Wednesday morning, in the three stores, large cakes formed in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that within the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinational companies complain to the survey institutes because the income remains below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
In many hospitals it is saved with disinfectants.
This year, several thousand infections have been registered in hospitals produced first by the misuse of antibiotics.
The reigning hygiene circumstances in hospitals, the climbing of beds and the overload of staff do not favour the control of infections - says the doctor-head department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is saved even with disinfectants.
Not long ago a MRSA infection has been diagnosed at the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the antibiotic resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A wound from a serious car accident was given high from the hospital and the same patient shortly after it had to return to the hospital as a result of the MRSA infection and since then it has not been able to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until December 10, this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multiresistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, the head of department of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multi-resistant agents has been safely, the rest has no information.
Nearly two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections produced by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once antibiotics are applied excessively or unduely, bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into very antibiotic-resistant bacteria and quickly contain in inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause severe hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia first in patients with transitory or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with weakened body, elderly or low-weight people.
According to the doctor-director of the János Hospital there is nothing special in MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, nursing staff care them in rubber gloves and mask and there are the right antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are examined in advance to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but not even thus infection can be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples.
It would be possible to prevent hospital MRSA infections in most cases, however current national hospital circumstances do not favour for the prevention of formation and contagion with multiresistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
Since this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and elderly households, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate the sick who carry the MRSA in their body.
However, in Hungarian hospitals microbiological sampling is not fashionable.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come out to public light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the doctor-chef of the department of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes rigorous commands for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives for the treatment of infections and pathological images.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent resistance to drugs, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saving with Desinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases the MRSA is infected from one patient to another through the health staff.
Therefore, the washing of the hands, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, but also in this sense considerable faults are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through drops transmission and direct contact between people, but in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, the hospitals rooms are often overwhelmed, the beds are often very together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation it is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater likelihood of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate preventive measures are met, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the pathogen infection can be stopped.
Government Programme Against MRSA
Treatment of infection with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Disease Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against it.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
Apparently the program has success, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show tendance to decrease in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multiresistant agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infections that are due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia of the police commander who caused a deadly accident
The official report has been made on the case of the deadly accident caused by the commander of the police of the district XXII.
It can be excluded the possibility that the since then removed commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday struck and caused the death of a transgender, led ebrio or in turmoil state, said Attila Morvai, spokeswoman for the General Prosecutor's Office of the Capital, after preparing the pericial report on the case.
The report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not consume alcohol before he put himself behind the wheel.
The then chief of the police department of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his particular vehicle when doubling to the Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district, struck a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, that is, that the pedestrian did not use the cebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Traffic Code are not reluctant circumstances, the driver should always give up the passage when double.)
The passenger died after being hospitalized.
According to the police, the district police officer resigned and requested his retirement, because the case was very complicated.
The case is investigated by the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors charged with the investigation.
More €400 million for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed on Friday in Budapest three credit limit agreements for a total value of 400 million euros to finance infrastructures for education, transport and the environment, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of 300 million euros to finance in the Hungarian budget the transport and environment protection projects, which will be carried out from the cohesion funds, of which the parties had already previously signed a credit contract for a value of 100 million euros, the contract they just signed refers to the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit contract of €150 million is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of 300 million euros for this goal of Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros the decision will be made later, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will use primarily for the University of Debrecen’s innovation and research project.
During the conversations they also covered the topic of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
The agreement was reached that when Hungary ultimates with the EU the details of the Metro financing, they will again deal with the issue whether or not it is necessary to modify the original contract and how to do it.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of 113 projects in Hungary for a value of €8.4 billion.
The interest rate of the credits is adjusted to EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grant period of 8 years, without charge for keeping the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed towards that Balkan country before little mentioned.
What, where and who buy in the even cheaper market in the EU, that will be incurred quickly?
The Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap ski pistes apartments and beach chalet.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, as in the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Costa del Sol", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for properties also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country – such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna – will awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Similarly, the capital Sofia will be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a quick recovery of the investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, which can be a highlight destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, precarious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria, also strive to change their lives and their way of living.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and ski parishes.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to install here buy new or renewed properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in bad state between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them then.
They require good communication and access, and for them the proximity of a large city, shops and generally a local doctor is important.
It is the second category of chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included among the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group is the real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent.
The rise in real estate prices significantly exceeds wages growth.
Fodor and the six per hundred Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor the meetings at the level of experts will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official inauguration will continue the negotiations at the level of ministers on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries in the world deliberate on the Balí Road Sheet which provides on the efforts after the emission reduction period, established in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
Currently there are animated discussions on the particular between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that for the moment it does not want to negotiate on accurate figures, although it tends to reach an agreement that compared to the 1990 situation, by 2020 the emissions of greenhouse gases will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major topic of the conference is whether the industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or not willing to offer material and technological assistance to the countries in need of it.
It has also reached an agreement on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of directors composed of 16 members, probably within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) - writes the "Piac es Profit".
The six per hundred of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister Gábor Fodor supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister said the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 level, regardless of whether the "post-2012 agreement" will be signed or not, and is willing to commit to decrease by even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to undertake commitments in accordance with their responsibility and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries signing the 1997 Kyoto Protocol undertaken to decrease by 5.2 percent, within this the then 15 EU member states undertaken to meet a 8 percent decrease.
Hungary’s commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet, the Ministry of Environment’s press release said.
It’s a lot what’s on the game in Bali, since within two years it will have to sign the international climate policy agreement in the long-term, because if not, it’s sure that its entry into force would be delayed for after 2012. In this case the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, whose need was warned in its latest report by the IPCC, the international scientific association of the UN that deals with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize.
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and could not be prevented by a rise of more than 2°C of the average Earth temperature, which, according to scientists, would have unmeasurable and irreversible consequences.
British army recruits on YouTube
The British army units on a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularise themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of the YouTube services: the special units deployed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helm are controlled in the general body of operations of Kandahar, then they are sent to London to be charged to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the air force soldiers that have been charged in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Ministry registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and published videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operations in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had loaded the videos with recruitment targets, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defense they also serve to present to the public the true goal of the presence of the British army abroad.
This type of propaganda practically doesn’t cost anything compared to conventional recruitment television spots – Defense expert Gordon Mackenzie told BBC – instead, they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason of being of the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans Played a Video Game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recelosely edited and censored recordings, on the distributor appear also amateur videos, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the “official” propaganda films, slightly hypocritic, officials talk as a maximum of losses, without presenting however the bloody part of the battles.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, numerous videos recorded in real operations have been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different way for recruitment with the free downloadable shooting video games called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly instead of the soldiers.
Tombola and Salt Cake at the Ministry's Christmas Party
It doesn’t seem very sentimental the labour minister Mónika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, she will celebrate a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to break the year 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with tombola and a brindis.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet – so the power is fun.
The state offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The greatest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for the Ministry workers.
In the Christmas of the Orphans will receive gifts the sons of the fallen soldiers and for the Christmas of the Missionaries the family members of the soldiers are invited to currently perform missions abroad.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million dollars for the festive environment of the end of the year.
The National Promotion Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the feasts of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4 320 000 HUF and of the six hundred ministry workers is expected the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the party of the portfolio will reign a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also act and there will be tombol draw.
The ANF Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) building with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost a million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will celebrate a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the entire building of the Theatre of Comedy.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, as we fail to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without clothes.
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the ANF party, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucía on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people participated in the dance.
The party began with the minister's greetings and after the dinner there was live dance music.
Answering the question of [origo] they: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear clothes or dresses at night.
The portfolios of health, work and local administrations are prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Mónika Lamperth does not wait for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end work meeting.
It is counted with the participation of a hundred eighty guests who - as the press department - will only drink coffee and salt cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai in return will simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry’s classroom for Local Governments and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own showroom with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget the reception will be paid with a buffet and a snack.
Since János Veres is the minister, the MF workers each year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial discourse, but also by the afternoon schedule of its celebration.
The portfolio of agriculture will offer a New Year reception on January 20th, in the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held in the Castle of Vajdahunyad of the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - will be a very simple standing reception, to which only specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments have communicated to [origo].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio could not report about the budget of the ministry’s Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party that will be held at the Museum of Applied Arts, more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are gathering.
The League Syndicates and the National Federation of Workers' Commissions will form a strike committee on Friday to coordinate the Monday strike that will last for indefinite time.
On Saturday, a protest meeting will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - unemployment will be initiated.
With all certainty this action will cause great transport difficulties, since the railway traffic will be completely stopped and until 13 hours the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will be in strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Syndicates will report on the details of their Monday strike that they will celebrate jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
Also the strike committee of the LIGA and the National Machinery Syndicate will be formed to coordinate the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a protest meeting will be held, as long as the participating trade unions will vote on Monday in strike for an indefinite time, if there is no agreement with the government.
This means, that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - did not report on the date of the end of the strike initiated.
If the National Assembly disapproves the public health law, the trade unions will immediately withdraw their call to strike.
Instead, if the law is approved, the strike committees will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday day order of the National Assembly it is also possible that only the public health law is voted in the very entering hours of the night, or near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will begin on Monday, there will be significant transport difficulties: on the railways it will stop working for indefinite time, in the morning it may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurb bus transport of the Volán companies.
Simultaneously, in numerous points of the country will be closed half of the roads.
Numerous trade unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some trade unions announced their strike for indefinite time, others for definite time.
Until Thursday afternoon, the State Railway and the Free Railway Workers’ Syndicate (SLTF) could not reach an agreement on the minimum services, though, by approaching Christmas holidays, more and more people travel on the trains.
According to information received so far, from the start of the day until 13 hours will be in strike the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company, the Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 am, will celebrate a four-hour strike the LIGA Syndicates of the Electric and Thermal Energy Industry, the Educators Syndicates called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Syndicate of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors will vote in national strike in alternative hours and the Democratic Syndicate of Workers of the Health and Social Sector (SDTSSS), which are part of the Syndical Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal regarding the reform of public health and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will enter into force next year.
The third is that they assure, even before 2010, for the case of advanced pensions the possibility that the occupations that deserve it can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Railway Workers Syndicate (SLTF), which is part of the League Syndicates, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway side lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The Hungarian Guard increases the risk in the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, constituted in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, from several points of view has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In the company’s “Risk Warning” it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk constitutes the fact that “with the aggravation of the ethnic tensions existing between the Gita and non-Gita population of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations may occur.”
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of a event of this character, the representative of the research institut added.
They stated that all this was due to one of the main faults of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: “the protagonists of public life ceded the public debate of the gitano problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to fundamentate their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between the gitans and the Hungarians.”
This worsenes the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts.
In addition to that, according to the Institute of Investigations, the activity of the National Guard, due to the great attention of the national and international media, “significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country.”
We remember that: from the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing groups in Hungary was increasingly advertised and encouraged, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that self-defined as "national self-defense associations".
“The common trait of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while they openly proclaim the training of their members for the defence – even armed – (civil defence, national defence, defence of public order), highlighting the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, i.e. of the state,” they add.
They said: all this is produced in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the dissatisfaction of society with politics and with political parties.
Because highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a risk factor also from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
“In recent months, in numerous neighboring states, the Hungarian Guard has been referred to as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighboring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region,” they added.
According to the research institut, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so the political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a way similar to the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) of the extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian Guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Gentiles that occurred in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Using this situation, the UNB decided to constitute the guard, with the argument that the organization’s goal is “the national self-defense.”
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been “gita terror” in Bulgaria, however the state has remained impotent and indifferent to the facts – reminds the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked an animated discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increased risk of ethnic confrontations indicates what certain Bulgarian gigantic organizations have announced that to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far has shown similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian citizens also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense – can be read in the warning about the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital’s research director Attila Juhász said at the news agency’s question: Risk analysis is one of the research institute’s activities.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the risk change, they inform the public opinion, as happened in this case, publishing their risk warning.
It is not always written with red numbers.
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays – that the coming year will be less – the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America the holidays are unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national feast, state feast and holidays.
The holidays are mainly related to religious holidays and historical feasts.
We celebrate the New Year too: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is holidays – this last above all so that those who passed celebrating the old year can rest.
Over the course of the year we have eleven holidays written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the revolution of 1848 and October 23 in memory of the revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the Foundation of the State, on the 1st of May the Day of Work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we remind our families and friends of the dead.
Moreover, in our country are two-day holidays the Easter of Resurrection, the Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridge when before or after the party there is a single working day.
In exchange for the weekends so extended, during the previous Saturdays you cannot be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of work that regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the party.
This legal rule is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory in return for companies and services institutions that, due to their function, work uninterrupted even during the holidays.
This year the work order can only be altered around the end of the year holidays: from December 24 practically life stops in the country, since according to the experiences, most people “do bridge” during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our holidays will coincide with mid-and-weekends, so there will be fewer changes in the working days than this year.
First, the agenda will be modified around the work party so that then, for four consecutive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that on Friday, May 2 will be a holiday day.
The other change is related to the 23th October party: on Saturday 18th October, you will have to work instead of Friday 24.
Instead, the year that comes during the holiday of the end of the year can be rested, since from December 24th it will not work almost anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
6 Disuasive Little Girls to Dirty Your Co-workers' Life
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us without realizing: all of them are part of our everyday Folklore in work.
You have to decide whether you adapt to the little discomfort or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can irritate others.
and advice.
Sorry, I forgot to notify you that you have been sought from the marketing department,” says one of your colleagues.
That’s why you didn’t go to a date.
In the best of the cases you feel it and try to repair the matter, maybe call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the least usual solution).
The problem is often resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to bitter explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can bitter the life of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Have you borrowed something that is not yours?
There is nothing more annoying than when you want to catch a document, an office utility or your phone and don’t find them.
Do you remember that yesterday you placed the graper on the table, but for this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your lost butterfly on one of your colleagues’ tables?
Don’t take anything from your colleagues without asking them, for they will be angry with you for their things.
Do not chew over or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and get exhausted before time.
Do you talk about your colleagues’ private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and Why?
Don’t give everyone the information you have about your colleagues’ private life!
Do not abuse your colleague’s confidence when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
Enter in yourself what you’ve heard and don’t joke about your colleague in his absence, even if others know the things about him.
Are you unjustified for illness?
When you call the office by telephone and say you’re sick and your head hurt unbearable, you feel bad or well, you feel that that day you prefer to rest; think that others should do your job, your impotent tasks, your job by end.
Don’t bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you won’t go to the office or something may happen to you, so you’ll have to stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss don’t have to confront with you absence the next day.
Tarrings, laughter, telephone calls
Are you stuck in your job, but you suddenly get rid of your colleagues?
Have you heard a telephone conversation that would have been better not to listen to it?
Do not bother your colleagues with your tarareos, cants, loud conversations (less when you do them above their head), pataleos, constant blasphemies, expressing your dissatisfaction loud.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Don’t mention the eventually reigning chaos in the office, nor the noise your colleagues make!
You must acknowledge if you have made a mistake that damages others and you must repair the mistake!
Ask how you can fix your lack.
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Jogging and shoes: a very comfortable habit for the house, but it is not suitable for the office!
Do not see a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Don’t be disregarded, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday, elegant and beautiful clothes when your occupation so requires!
Loss interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car advances slowly in the usual morning climb.
It sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
Increase the volume.
It changes the rhythm of music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female chore as a real jewel intervenes.
The mr2 channel reproduces Zagar's Wings of Love song.
The national musical life didn’t hurt us much with quality electronic pop.
But now this appears completely different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs of the underground [b2]digital [b3]national are slowly changing the image and although again the rock style garage is fashionable, breaks guitars, the national pop electro has demonstrated: there are novelty under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi set until he started his independent career because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, electronic music dancing and pop, he tried to triumph, when he was asked for soundtracks [b4] cinematographic (pl.
by Ferenc Török Szezon.
The broadest audience knew the set that at first acted only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album edited in 2002 among the fifty most important national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend formator, able to sell itself also in the western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and its set are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether they wear this label or not.
The set reacted as it should react: it prepared a new and even better album.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead will open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
This title was one of the lines of the ancient ensemble of Balázs Zságer.
It’s well the reference about the airoso, about the flight, but in addition to the airoso of music, now appeared – according to the spirit and trend of the time – the guitar that sounds stronger, the rock and roll effect.
With these songs he presented the album in the Millennium György Ligeti, the singer who currently works in England with the set The Puzzle.
The album includes a true success of the mr2 Petõfi channel that recently broadcast popular music from morning to night. This broadcaster brought up to the ears of the broadcasters the high-flight music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Everything is in order (?).
He asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what are you playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of selected audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also so-called underground alternative music can be bored, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, making it commercial.
But also a good pop song can arise from a sincere inspiration.
Also the attitude of the listeners works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the welcoming of your music by the Hungarian and foreign audience?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially in the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the twenty-five-year-old generations attend the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
Q: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are, and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good when I see more and more people attend our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in the concerts where there is mutual influence, but this is only in the unseen changes of the moment.
And yet I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hg.hu: To what point do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his way, although they sometimes try to compare our music with that of him.
We rather work in team, trust the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first it was inevitable that our works compare to Yonderboi’s music, since many of us started our career in their group and thereafter we undertaken another way.
hvg.hu: In Mr2's list of successes, Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people heard for the first time the name of Zagar in relation to this song.
Did you consciously open up with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to make big successes and sell our album with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the album, trying to relax after the sound orgy of the album and the heavier topics.
Q: How did you select the six singers?
Why just to them – what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a coro in the style of gospel.
Then the idea came to create this chorus of good voice solists from our own national musical scene.
Thus it was created that chorus of six women - that is, Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was later baptized as Underground Divas.
Hg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly that way or the girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we had all the material on the album, we thought something was still missing.
The acorde attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything arrived practically at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very enthusiastic then, but naturally I needed the Divas too.
With my voice I’t have worked so strongly.
hvg.hu: Both on the concert and on the album it looks like the girls were on the background.
There are no soloists (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own paper, they sing all together and not stronger than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They are also on the background on the scene.
Intentionally ?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute solo papers.
The song also verses about it, about that we forget for a while our ego, the one who from where it has come and where it goes, let us then let those wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would have wanted to make others also feel that state of euphory mood that we feel when this song was born.
Q: Which work did you do most?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in reality to no one, rather when mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little, everything was put to its place as in a puzzle.
Q: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concerts and because I’ve already released the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stock exporter risks billions of dollars for his inferiority complex
It is unfair malware.
This is the way he points out to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French giant banker of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about 5 billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself with his colleagues and, undoubtedly, with good abilities.
It inducted a long time ago, unlike all major Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character," he heard from his superiors, the same who sent him to the police.
But what comes from Kerviel’s answers according to what French media, such as Le Monde, translates, is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his.
Crisis not just in America
“All I wanted to do was to make money for my bank,” he said in his answers.
In the summer, he managed to earn 500 million euros during the American crisis.
This opportunity came in early year.
In February they began to hear some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would begin to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, his profits exceeded the 1.6 billion euros.
“When I’ve already won my first 500 million I don’t know how to notify it,” Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
During the interrogation, he declared that he had falsified the records in such a way that it had not reached its discovery.
He even deceived the bosses, even when the Eurex Stock Exchange began to be interested in their.
The risk becomes a profit.
Was he afraid to be discovered?
Or rather no.
“I thought I had earned 1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did you get so much of your will to take this risk?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He entered to work at Société Générale in the year 2000, exactly after he finished studying in Lyon.
His annual salary was managed between $51,000.
Two years later he was a stock exchange assistant and in 2005 he became a stock exchange with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in the year 2005 I already noticed that they looked at me with caution.
Because of my training and also of my professional and personal progress,” Kerviel described the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he won, during the bomb attacks in London, playing down a title of 500 million euros.
And this supposed a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we leave you.
“It’s like a snowball,” the police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all of this or that they rather suspected it.
“As long as I earned money, they closed their eyes.”
After that, the coup came in early this year.
In one day he lost a billion euros.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to delete all the footprints.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost €5 billion for its fault.
How did they locate it?
He became suspicious from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The rider who has no holidays is a rider who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his expedition,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has a chance of getting 365 billion
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion crowns).
This is almost half of the total sum that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007-2013.
Of seven operational programs, approximately 125 billion crowns will come out for the regions.
Czech companies will receive around 100 billion crowns from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Program is the largest of the operational programs and represents up to 22 percent of the resources that the Czech Republic can get from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will count with the amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should get funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the newly entered countries that least use them.
Former President of Nicaragua sentenced to 20 years in prison
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals sentenced the former president of the country, Arnaldo Alemán, to 20 years in prison on Thursday, sentenced in 2003 for $100 billion (about $1.8 billion).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go to house arrest in his stock not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this point, according to the AP agency that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again among the rows.
According to the president of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will depend rather on the penitentiary agents if they let Germany end their punishment at home or if they make it return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how a German constantly transferred government money to a company’s account in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
So is it.
The budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first elaborated by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD could not allow not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of trust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view although the most influential, calmly passed the new law.
It is a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and starts the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last social-democratic governments suffered three defects that for this year of 2008 is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of them is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenses of the mandates that are not only the pensions but also the social benefits that already last year were approved before the elections by the “silent” coalition of ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first deficit.
The third limit is the public financing deficit, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
However, the highest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The clock pump, however, is in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many Mayor to be able to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from the taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, often issued, meaninglessly, obligations with which they debt disproportionately to their councils.
In recent years they managed to pay these debts through the mass sale of energy shares and other development networks they received from the state and privatization.
Currently, they do not have this resource.
If we only take care of the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, passes through phases of growth in the same way as the rest of the world, from what the ČSSD is.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put order on the state’s finances.
However, instead the state continued to debt.
The rest of countries, except some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That’s why the massive social programs are not necessary, which, unfortunately, in the last few years unnecessarily swallowed with giant measures.
And even though they managed to eliminate part of the incomprehensible populist expenses approved this year before the elections, if soon does not change the retirement age and the pension reform then will be the real end of any policy in this country and, rule who rule will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who rule will turn into officials, mechanical distributors of the majority of the money of retirement taxes and social benefits.
That’s why this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of the normal expenditure of the mandatory expenditure.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion for the year 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not wasted in the last ten years what they could.
We would not want the politicians who rule to become only officials so we must be patient and grant this weak government coalition, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from the taxes and taxes, the tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
In the Monetary Market, more than $100 billion will be received through tender.
In these tenderings the banks raise the interest rates for which they are able to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send to tender $40 billion, and then another $24 billion will be provided by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and decrease the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step must solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuous growth of the free capital shortage that banks could borrow,” wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group’s customer report.
"This coordinated action of the central banks probably decreased the recession in the United States from 65 percent to a fifty percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists are still expecting billions of losses.
“Central banks should really be afraid of what awaits them even when they decided to take this step,” said ABN Amro’s leading economist Kieran Davies.
“It seems that the situation is really bad,” he added.
Central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that therefore they will have to borrow more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after they failed to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate that is used for money loans on the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to borrow money even when the U.S., Canada and Britain central banks cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
“It will have the same effect as another fall of interest rates,” said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists don’t wonder that the step given by the central banks contributes to burning the crisis because it doesn’t solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the U.S. real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change affects mainly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus expressed himself again with regard to the global warming problem.
The criticism arose now with the closure of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the ecologists' debates are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the conference structure that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that is used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are artificial flames of words, substitutes of the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book emphasized that this topic is very important to him and that it is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy to discover his book translated into German because as he said, "Many times I only find myself with the caricature of my ideas."
Now the interested parties can be informed about their variopintas opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, according to his opinion, enough assumptions as to write a book like this.
He is academic, with the ability to follow and judge a specialized thesis, has experience with statistics and is also economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists about the global warming, that the consequences of current changes are not so big and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experienced with totalitarisms he considers it unacceptable to impose unproved opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
At the questions of the present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against “the reasonable environmental defenders but against the ecologist militants who do not consider the relationship between costs and benefits.”
The same topic was discussed by Klaus in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driving license
Six hundred thousand drivers passed the date and therefore they did not change their old driving license whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials give them time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers are found on the roads without the valid license.
According to traffic, the carnet has not changed it mainly those who no longer even want to drive.
While in the villages announce a rapid decline in the change of carnes, the metropolitan offices are filled with requests and the interest in the new carnes has increased.
The municipality calculates about 2,000 daily customers.
We are waiting for half an hour in the cottage.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet taken the new license.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issuance of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who are obligatory to change their license and do not reach until the end of the year, but will go out on the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The infringer will pay a maximum of 2,000 crowns.
The police can fix the offence with an amnesty.
In case of an administrative infringement, the fine will rise to 2,500 crowns.
According to the above information could receive a fine that person who does not go anywhere.
They would be able to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to moderate fines of a thousand crowns, as a maximum.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
This is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
Those who do not want to drive should give their driving license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the carnets issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually go changing the other types of driving license.
People with the document between the years 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between the years 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court Reduces Punishment for Berdych Complicate Detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in jail.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided the penalty to be reduced, the first to one year, and the second to two years.
The detectives of the Prague department against the organized crime would fall, at the beginning, between 14 and 12 years old.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case but he is in the first place waiting for the first instance court judgment.
In other cases, he has been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can’t receive more.
In January, the district court recognized the participation in the grip of 19 people and the highest court, today, revoked 16 of them.
Most of the accusations of the accused were rejected by the investigation because they were invented causes.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in accordance with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, hid the robbery, and helped members of criminal group to avoid penalties.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Koňařík.
The accusation refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between the years 1999 and 2001.
As regards the theft, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without permission of weapons.
In the home record, the police found a gun, a steel nucleus ammunition, a laser conductor and an ammunition.
The group of criminals, according to the accusation, stole them tens of millions of crowns.
Except for twenty men in this trial, the court has already recognized Berdych and other accused guilty.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some causes they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Půt and Maroš Šulej, who have for now avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they wait for the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account for changing a few children: 12 million
By changing some children in the maternity house the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of Třebič 12 million crowns of compensation plus the expenses of the trial.
For each mother, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is in principle not agree with Veleba’s proposal.
“These demands are not approved, it’s too high,” Dostál said after the meeting today.
“To make an idea of this counterproposal, we need the expert’s report that the counterpart ordered to investigate.
We will check if it has a rescue value.
We keep ourselves in the opinion that it will be hundreds of thousands for all,” Dostál emphasized.
The amount should be between the 100,000 and the 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jabloň family wanted, for every month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the expert's report, only that this was prepared at the Motol faculty hospital in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychic impact and stress of different levels and depths.
The stress situation was best tolerated by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are living today and with regard to what is happening today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by nurses in the maternity house in Třebič last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Čermákový to Přibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova to Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered at the end of October to each family 100,000 crowns as compensation expenses for the mistake committed at the Třebič hospital that the region manages.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must extract from the reservation fund and extraordinaryly can ask for help from the administrator.
The court so far recognized a proportionally low compensation, the amounts that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million crowns.
Polívka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the trial on the brand Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the judge of the provincial tribunal of Ostrava, he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Valaquia but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polívka was not presented to the oral sight today.
According to your lawyer, the case probably has not ended and your client will appeal.
“The trial consists in Mr. Harabiš and his team are a parasite of Bolek Polívka’s popularity,” said after the trial, Polívka’s lawyer.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone comes the image of the actor and comic.
The same idea has Harabiš.
“We have been working for about 10 years.
Search for money and invention of activities,” he said.
For him, the cause of the prosecution is in the money.
“After years I realized that the project is successful and that therefore I could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polívka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not about directing him towards the creation of a fictional kingdom.
A few years later Harabiš was told to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity of which Harabiš later created the society Kingdom of Valaquia.
In the year 1997, Polívka agreed on the use of her name and sign on the passports and even offered its owners discounts to visitors of her farm and attendants to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the scene for his own business benefit.
“It’s clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia,” the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team who dedicated themselves to it completely.
The collaboration, among today dissolved parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka the official crown in Vsetín.
From that moment, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabiš whose culmination came with the defeat of "King Boleslav I, the elected forever."
The main role in the kingdom, by mediation of Harabiš derived in singer Jarmila Šuláková, as mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an accusation against Harabiš and his society which has so far been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the dispute, the throne tournament with his princesses, which is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out.
He did not want to reveal more data or dates.
“We have no hurry.
It should be something like the king’s way to Moravia.
The king should be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Prejudices overcome
I never really liked Peugeotu 206.
Its marching characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, of the headset space on the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the Combi carrossery means in this sense, that I will not suffer before the two meters of length.
Flying around the world
I walk through the inside quickly so that I don’t repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would value more the design invention although the car already looks pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are the times when we complain about short seats and supports.
Also, unlike the model 206, the side direction has improved considerably.
And the space?, and here you can feel how the measurements of the carrossery have grown.
In the Combi disappears the aforementioned lack of space in the headline.
Baggage to the baggage
But the main thing in this vehicle is your luggage.
This must be valued as very accessible (thanks the abatable back door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber rays that are an ideal solution.
They don’t bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
Let’s stay in the deposit.
According to the tables, in basic regime it has a capacity of 428 liters which in comparison with the competition is rather an average value.
But not in comparison with the most sold vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot remains on the ground with its perceivable 52 liters.
From holidays abroad or by placing the child's cochecit its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I have to quote the floor that remains quite flat after dropping the backups of the second line.
120 horses in four marches
Our tested car was equipped with an injection lighting of four valves over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a power of 88 kW.
And to say truth so is how it should look like a 1,600 that underestimates the family five doors.
It is silent, it consumes little and above all, it has impulse.
If I compare it with the time of the skoda of then that seemed as if the escape tube was tapped by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The price of the car is not for every pocket.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection lighting of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, still can be.
Our aggregates put it from 410.900 crowns, which is already too much.
The premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headsets, automatic air conditioning, automatic cleaners, automated back windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons in the Fabia and you’ll get to a pretty similar number.
It remains to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students are not included in English schools
In English schools children from Eastern Europe are assisted and therefore, the locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record those cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern Europe children in British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronches among students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the police of Chatmam arrested a Slovak woman who was sticking palms to a ten-year-old student with a green beard.
In her defense she said that the girl was insulting her son with insults of racist tone.
Police had to act also after a two-year-old girls attack a Slovak immigrant.
The girls grabbed him with racist insults and threw him stones.
“When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to shout us.
When I told him to leave it he made us the ademan to throw us apples and pears, and then he dropped his pants and showed us his back," she described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with the east-Europe emigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above, show us how the environment in English schools begins to be quite tight.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in Britain who came here for labor reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is actually the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your holidays can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Arenous and golden beaches, big waves or a quiet sea like a basement.
The palms and the whole included with rooms offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the island of the Caribbean you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island it finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colon called it, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spanish extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 20s.
He ordered it to build one of the chiefs of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was of crime in the U.S. (and therefore, prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
The guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra.
In Havana high buildings emerged, the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the past century were running along wide avenues.
Ernest Hemingway bought a stock in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Wedding left their signatures the stars of the show world and politicians from all over America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abanense you can leave also your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel National you mix the cocktails according to your wishes.
And those cars already of cult of the 1950s, until today continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who arrived already long ago have oxidated among these wet and salty winds.
Even when Havana, especially the old neighborhood is going to deteriorate notably, there are not so many wonderful colonial monuments in the surroundings as there.
Other places are metamorphosed in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism brings so much necessary money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the world unique and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow routes in steam or electric machines.
Their cochers for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brother models that are in other parts of the world are only found in the museums.
Where to go?
The most famous place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Per, just remember that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum that for those who are writer lovers, they should not stop visiting it.
The Valley of Viñales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows in calice rock lands.
Mogotes, calice rocks and elevated rocks scarp in the falls of the valley, and in their grutes fertile lands are acclimated thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where, probably, the highest quality tobacco is grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the Havana Pure Factory you can find with your final product.
Per someone seems interesting that there was the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman.
Trinity
Old Abolengo city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beauty with the buildings in the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by the later arrived French settlers, in four centuries has barely changed.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Serra of Escambray, is a place so apart that even in the 50s of the past century there was no road that connects it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed, for every person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to stay in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth seeing interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as the Ancon Beach or the valley of the sugar factories.
The night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the morning.
by Baracoa
Small town in the western part of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
This opinion is already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that get there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (in reality it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was located and now there is a hotel with its same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, puros, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of the Cochins and the island of Pinos, the Tropical Cabaret, the patron of Cuba, the Virgin of the Copper Charity, the Santaria, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all this could fill many pages.
But, as you say, it’s better to see it ever.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, the Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to U.S. Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as thought, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
Along with the growing conflicts with the Taliban movement, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to a greater activity, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the distribution of development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population that they alone can start economic and security development,” De Browne, the defense minister, told BBC.
The 90 percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels according to U.S. military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased compared to the last year by 27 percent, and in the province of Helmand to 60 percent.
NATO countries have around 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of organization and equipment of the units.
Exactly they ask more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not glad to know what we have in the earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have 90 percent of soldiers and teams we would need, and that’s little,” De Hoop told Reuters at the closing of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
Among the assisting countries in recent months implies the controversy of whether all the allies do the maximum in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticized.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacement in Afghanistan.
But they are in a zone of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in our, in the south and east of the country,” Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun, this week called vagues to the German soldiers.
“Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are devoted to playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and published a photo where the British troops played a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach a billion in 2009
For each Czech, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt ascended in September to 842.7 billion crowns.
This year the government planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the economy of the state budget.
The state debt of the Czech Republic grew at the end of September to 842.7 billion crowns.
In nine months of this year it increased to 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased 13.4 billion crowns.
Today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt in early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state has debted more than 111 million crowns.
“For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the border of the billion crowns until 2009.
The next year the debt should move between the 900 billion and the trillion of crowns,” said for the server iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
The Economist of Next Finance, Vladimír Pikora, said: “We could spend the billion during the year 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we don’t know yet.
If the situation in the political scene changed and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see such a change,” he added.
The doubt is growing
State debt creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the state budget deficit.
State debt is paid by treasury bonds, state bonds, direct credits or, for example, European Investment Bank loans.
The state’s internal debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt for now has grown from 1.7 billion crowns to 123 billion crowns.
The so-called negotiable state debt at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z crowns since June was reduced to 13.7 billion crowns.
The average expiry of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total interannual debt from the first to the third quarter creates a 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated primarily from obligations where there is a 20% growth.
It’s bad that the debt grows but on the other hand shows that it’s going to negotiate until there’s a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the payment and government debt management strategy for the year 2007 it is out that the government planned to borrow this year 159.2 billion crowns.
At the beginning of December, the ministry decreased the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the forecast 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of the maximum resources planned for the Czech consolidation agency with about 13.3 billion crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for the payment of pensions, 43 billion crowns for the funding of state bonds and 1.8 billion crowns in payments of the European Investment Bank loans.
He compared today before a court to Jartúm for having given a name to a peluche bear.
The British teacher judged in Sudan for insulting Islam has been sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a court in Jartum to 15 days in prison and to expulsion, her lawyer said.
The British was accused of leaving students from 6 to 7 years of age to give the name of Muhammad to a peluche bear when any representation of the Islamic prophet is illegal.
It was passive of a punishment.
This 54-year-old British school teacher according to Jartum’s Unity High School in Sudan, has been arrested on Sunday at her home and accused of Islam attack and sedition, under article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints of parents of students before the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story dates back to the month of September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class horse bear.
“Eight names come out of the children’s mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school director Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children made a book for the class with the photo of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear he - himself didn't carry any label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, a professor at the same school in Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done something that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m sorry only that I have asked the children to vote for a name,” he said, “it’s just an innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous students of the school teacher who describe it as "very attentive to their students" and "who never talks about religion in class".
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules concerning the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy?
This is a question of interpretation.
It has not reached an agreement on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
At the end, the failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo have ended Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last session of discussions without having been able to overcome their differences about the future status of the separatist province.
“It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status,” said European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger, during a press conference in Vienna.
Submitting that peace in the region was “in play,” its American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We don’t predict violence for now but we enter a very difficult period,” he added, pointing out that “evident tensions exist.”
End of mediation on December 10th
The Trojan mediators, which regains the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last visit Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province populated by 90% of Albanians could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council, from here to December 10.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and last session of negotiations since the Troika has been charged with a new mediation by the UN, last August.
Americans and Europeans consider their mediation to end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked in the Security Council the granting of independence in Kosovo, insist on a persecution of the negotiations beyond this top date.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a commitment solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence.
After eight years of the UN administration of Kosovo, the Westers consider independence under the supervision of the European Union as the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in her favour.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
“Unfortunately, no agreement has been found,” said President of Kosovo’s autonomous authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where these “debates of the last opportunity” were held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, has given part of his weaknesses.
But he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belongs to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
“Dominated Effect”
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a commitment always factible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province’s independence.
Belgrade says it fears a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the 1990s independence wars.
“For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible.”
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia,” Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.”
At the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that “the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status,” adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be made “in concertation” with the Western.
Bush signs agreement between Palestinians and Israelis
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he held on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately set up negotiations in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60 year old litigation between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations regarding the itinerary for peace they accepted in 2003.
The head of the White House emphasized that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority presided by Abbas would attempt “to conclude a peace treaty that would solve all pending issues, without exception, including the central issues.”
This denomination covers the three main peliagud problems of the dispute point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the luck of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the word after the U.S. President, Abbas insisted that the coming negotiations are “global and deepened” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, the water, the security, among other things.”
Upon his turn at the tribune, Olmert committed to making the coming negotiations “direct and continuous” and to “do an effort to conclude them in the course of the year 2008.”
At the end of 2008 Bush set the term for the launch of his “vision of two states” Palestinian and Israeli co-existing.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had achieved an effort in this direction by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a confrontation point in the history of the Middle East, more because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," said Prince Saudi in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
As always in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspection of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after the 17th Street of Luisa-Miguel, to Villiers-le-Bel.
“I was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating light,” a police source explains.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, "not homologated, i.e. not authorized to circulate on the public road" (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated "to all gas ".
“He caught the police car on the left side, after a failure of the pass to the right,” the police said.
The control of alcoholemia practiced on the vehicle occupants was negative.
The state of the car (the out-of-the-most front, scratched parabrisas, scratched parachutes) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Pontoise Republic prosecutor, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he has entrusted an investigation for “facts of involuntary murder and denial of aid” to the IGPN, co-cogged with the departmental direction of public security of Val-d’Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor precises that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, discarded the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed “the version of the police, to know that this minimotocycle arrived relatively quickly to their left.”
Yesterday, a type of ranch, undoubtedly provoked by the froting of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck the time for the police car to get to brake.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical investigation.
The bodies of both victims have been autopsiated yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated quickly by Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, not thus providing assistance to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove “all serious lack” concerning this point.
“It’s the most difficult aspect of the investigation, it needs more investigations, about which you have to be very prudent,” a police source said.
Liberation found an eye witness of these moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that just gives the scene.
“We went down immediately, with my cousin who is a nurse to the hospital, to try to reanimate them, this witness tells.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw “a completely disadvantaged police officer, who cried.
Two others tried to reanimate one of the young people, the room spoke at the phone.
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that the people present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been carried by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescue arrived “approximately twenty minutes after the police march.”
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
“I will not allow the police to take no assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tension rises in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the emergency state was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken in the framework of the state of emergency have been wounded by the tear granates used by the order forces, witnesses said.
The latter replicated with stone shots, hurting police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police charged and kidnapped lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about 500 detainees during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (center) and in Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrown into the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president “exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke against the state of emergency and the waste to which they swear before Musharraf.”
“Musharraf’s promise is no longer fulfilled.”
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly referred to the exception measure proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
It had to be stated in the coming days about the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, to indirect suffrage, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we see is illegal, anticonstitutional and contrary to the failures of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf’s promise of leaving the head of the army and becoming a civil president “no more values” after the emergency state was established, said on Monday the assistant information minister Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform from here to the 15th of November, date of the end of his first presidency.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be transferred.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his adjunct head of the armies.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unpredictable or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one pregnancy in three (36%) is unpredictable, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute of Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unpredictable or unplanned births.
Different contraception methods such as pills or sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of contraception allowed, however, a better “fertility domain,” according to the Institute that notes that the pills use index among women aged 20 to 44 has passed from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births out of ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple of every five and if possible for the spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular Repair on the Space Station
It will need more than seven hours of space work to the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew colleagues at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a broken solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to their duration, their distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments “chapped” by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery launch machine, a thick cylindrical piece charged with soon receiving European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see square).
This module is a type of landing antenna for the modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After deploying it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a size of 76 meters.
And it’s where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordeons, has been damaged in a little more or less than a meter by a cable that was dragged.
The deployment has been stopped in order not to damage the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had initially to make a control out of the Discovery launch, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotating system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to carcolear at the end of the 30 meters of length of the teledirected arm of the shooter added to the station to make the repair.
It is one of NASA’s best “spacewalker”.
High, resistant, very skillful, has a well-developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46 years, this doctor of training has been charged with "operating" the "woven" solar panel.
After having inspected precisely the damages, he separated the failed cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second spacewalker who had stayed near the air clock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a minibaston of hockey embedded with an isolator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and “chapped” by the astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was finished, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the interior of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts took advantage of a noon rest before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launch for the return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock market
The EADS action is currently in sharp decline at the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the A400M delays.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to review its operational outcome for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progress of the engine development of the A400M, which conditiones the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to palliate the delay taken on the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, rises “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus”, announced the mother house of the European constructor EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new exploitation outcome (EBIT) goals for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adds without any more encrypted accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It must be remembered that the operating result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to loads linked to the delays of another program, the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group predicted a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The statu quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, Russia united.
Confirming his aspiration to stability, even to authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses today the voters a television message on the public chains, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
It does it as the leader of the list for Russia united, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is revealed crushing.
Yesterday, the president did not leave anything to be transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, satisfied with delivering a new burden against the West accused of interference – his topic of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we wish honourful, more transparent and more open elections, unincidental elections,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He denounces a campaign broken by pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there has never been "this dirty elections, even in the time of Eltsin."
After the repression of the last weekend's demonstrations, the former world champion of jacket Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are banned visits, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unprecedented parliamentary elections, there are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published the date of the first round of the presidential election, on March 2, 2008; the candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
There is no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It is a tradition.
"The Russians guarded the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they don't feel owners of their destiny," estimates sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the State University of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society was delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, “Putin restored the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disaster,” estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "reject by their own will the personal responsibility" of those who had briefly proved after the USSR collapse.
“Why to reflect?”
The phenomenon affects all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite thinks to preserve the statu quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) lead the local lists of the United Russia.
New imported freedoms from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
It prefers stability.
In the name of that the Russians will not vote either for the extremists.
Summary of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: "Why to reflect?
“Those who are in power are not too evil, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archive documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not until here consultable only for a “humanitarian” purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or its right-wing members.
The eleven states responsible for their management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to search engines and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has ended, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow to do searches “particularly on the displacements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of the forced workers,” explains Reto Meistern, the director of these files administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several states, such as Germany, opposed the public opening of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or of the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find the landlords deported or subjected to mandatory work and eventually to provide them a proof of their internation, in order to open the way to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with dozens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen looks at a limited interest.
"There's nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Centre for Search for Antisemitism at the Technische Universität of Berlin, said in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free exchange agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros a year.
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are hoping to sign a free exchange agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the European Union had given in April their approval to the European Commission to begin negotiations with the aim of signing free exchange agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The European Union is India’s first trade partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the ninth trade partner of the European Union, according to European Commission figures.
"A free exchange pact will greatly dop both economies" and "India would improve its entry to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," said Peter Mandelson.
The Asian and European giants exchange annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential."The European Union and India meet on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England notes concerns offering £10 billion in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was worried about relieving the current turn of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of ten billion pounds to the base index of 5.75% in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
“To relieve the concerns according to which the financial market conditions will be tight at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions on this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period that starts on December 6 in the form of an open market transaction for five weeks,” it said in a statement.
The bank says that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on December 6 at 12h 15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It’s the first time it seems that the Bank of England BoE puts liquidities on the market for five weeks in an open market transaction.
This is usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that it is “ready to take other measures to maintain the index” of interbank loans daily in line with its basic index.
The interbank daily index was on Wednesday at 5,829%.
The index after three months established to 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England were combined with an important penalty index that had dissuaded the banks to resort to that.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the pound exchange in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny the review of PS's propositions on purchasing power
The group UMP and Nouveau Centre refused Thursday to discuss articles of the proposition of socialist law on purchasing power, which equals a disestimation of the text.
Inscribed in a socialist “niche” (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS including the 50% increase in surplus for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP (internal tax per oil products), a cheque-transport or the rental restrictions.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the session has been raised at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
PS Deputies leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his propositions in the form of amendments to the rectificative bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light.
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, neither more nor less, the current festival movement in America,” C3’s Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the camping.
The festival will take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
In another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the direction of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival at the Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owned, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizing tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Qualifying Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event" he've ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We’ve chosen Philadelphia as a market and we worked with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we’re staying in low-class policies due to the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we prepared to create a magnificent festival on an exceptional site that, recently, will take place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having shut down the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8 million and $11.3 million respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in a urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a countryside festival, while our ones are performed rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to fuse, in one way or another, both formulas to give at the same time an impression of rural festival in the European and urban way in the American way.”
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiasticly supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement, but claims "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says this festival’s hotel offer is “very big,” for example, the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of going under press.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, with the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 colleagues, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal:
Montreal faces Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator is opposed to that...
This seduction mission is part of the delegate functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions ".
Is it difficult to compete with the “Governator”?
“We have to be prudent, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you’ll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best,” he says.
The race to the festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte’s priority is nevertheless the promotion of the cinema here.
The Oscars race has begun.
All West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them value and ensure that the producers make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on board in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival, in November.
Quebec also presented four long films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market?The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Less than five weeks to give up the closure of the exercise, investors are already throwing their hands waiting for the traditional year-end rally to arrive.
However, this year the experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "from the statistical point of view, December in stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not appropriate to make forecasts based exclusively on statistics, more even because in the current context, uncertainty raises in the markets, at least in the short term.”
Although they are not supporters that the stock exchange runs in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that “the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect fled towards quality values both in the long and short trams.”
For this reason, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility “especially because the impact of the likely fall of the Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationist tensions.”
Javier Barrio, responsible for sales of BPI in Spain, coincides with it’s not a good time to advent to say it’s going to have rally.
“It’s not the thing for many joy,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs marked on November 8, when the index closed at 15.945,7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer near the 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to the pensions plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert matits that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will be advanced to the second week of December, after the Constitution Bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Bank, estimates that we are close to technical levels and “thus we could see a reboot of the index that could be pushed depending on the news coming from the U.S. as to the consequences of the crisis on the credit market.”
The analyst believes these are positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be the ones responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum quotas.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that “these year it touches the big values.”
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date arrives, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, from Inversis Banco assures that the rise will come from the hand of the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in case of giving.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC to follow the same path," the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological will also do it very well although in this case there is not a lot of representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, in only two occasions December has been a low month.
The authentic year-end rally was in 2003, a year in which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (for the moment the Ibex rises 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its final rally.
People will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent for the bank a great change.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to give the jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 pm, and open the Saturday from 10 hours to 20.30 pm.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, it is about to close an agreement with the trade unions to close 75% of their offices on Saturday in exchange for opening a afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of the Popular experience will be decisive for other entities to point or not to this initiative that secures the hours of the stores.
This is precisely the goal that people pursue with the project.
Capture the private customers that move through these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, autonomous and stores of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling the already existing.
For this purpose, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new design, more current, with more bright colors.
Commercial banking manager, Ángel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not imply a big investment, although a greater employment, since it passes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, according to Ángel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía de Madrid have been the chosen, and it seems to be right, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And other 60 operating under the Mundocredit brand, specialized in immigrants, also with very broad hours, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax locations they will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of their offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to make the competition to our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles its rival Antena 3’s stock exchange value
We have achieved it.”
With that phrase he expressed his satisfaction by Paolo Vasile, Telecinco’s delegated counsel, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain he directed doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
“It’s what hurt me, not because we’ve grown more but because we’ve fallen less,” she said.
However, he emphasized that in a weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco finished the day with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit places its loss in what we take of year at 15.66%.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with a 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday gave up 1.52% and accumulates a drop of 40,5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communications companies quoted rises to 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518,53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1.779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because we’re talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we profit it in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it is expected to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1 billion gross advertising revenues, according to Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated counsel of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the branch that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data is realised, the television chain would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing compared to the 965.4 million of the year 2006.
On its part, the net invoice of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach the 734.4 million) while net TV revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the elevated pay out that has beenined until now: in 2006, the company presided by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that, although it’s early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in partnership with its Mediaset matrix.
"We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave our shareholders happy, to whom we have already given value with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market gives signs in these moments of some tiredness.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its Telecinco profit estimates by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It is due, they explain, to the fact that it has cut the expected growth of income from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3 profit forecast by 4.5 percent in 2008 and 7.5 percent in 2009.
3 Opinions
1 of 1.
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both values based primarily on their high profitability by dividend and long-term sustainable potential.
2nd
Caja Madrid: it looks better to Telecinco (acumulate) than to Antena 3 (managing) for the 'attractive multiples' and the business rise.
and 3.
JPMorgan: recommends infrared in both cases by having 'similar threats' (saturated market and worse economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary trial, which ended today with the vote by the Congress of the amendments incorporated to the project in the Senate, the Government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the year ends.
Representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by Deputies and Senators to negotiate and consensate the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and to detailly regulate the activity of the entities so that the markets work efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernization of the financial markets, while strengthening the investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the different supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulations will allow financial advisory services to both specialized firms and physical or legal persons and create a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory societies (AFI), which join securities, securities agencies and portfolio-managing societies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that regulated secondary markets are added to multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The law also obliges investment services companies to disclose on the market information about the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to carry a record of all the transactions they carry out, to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congress's Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that the titled debts are considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high danger for the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with the U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics and Business can develop 30 years after the 1977 Royal Decree approved that delimites the professional functions reserved to economists.
On its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, which will work for another account, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its products marketing and customer capture services to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized IPC increases by five decades in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides an advance of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
The publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide timely and quality data to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the employee for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various methods of statistical modeling to estimate the information that is not yet available at the time of its publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only orientative, so it does not need to necessarily coincide with the definitive data, which will be released next December 14.
"The IPC will continue to be at relatively high levels"
Vice-President second and Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said the rise of 4.1% of IPC in November is a "temporary figure", but at the same time he said the price index will continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the congress halls that "although the figure is not good" the differential of inflation in Spain regarding the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of the last years.
He also explained that in November "there has been less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not count with such a high rise.
“We expected a figure around 4%,” the Minister of Economy said in a statement.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
The Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to £12 billion (16.8 billion euros) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time it had record deposits above 25 billion pounds, a figure that has progressively fallen in two and a half months because of the uncertainty of its customers and despite the guarantee of a hundred percent of that money that the Government offered and will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the entity with its financial trademark Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenue in British banks that are deposited in the next three years to get those 18 billion pounds remaining until achieving the target of 30 billion pounds.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virgin consortium, in which three other companies participate, as their preferred to rescue him from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today at first hour of the morning the current mayor of the Murciano municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for its alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot that has been revealed this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the head of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then municipality councillor, and that according to research sources consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal dependencies and the Urbanism council and no further detainees are discarded in the upcoming hours.
In addition, the letter of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the urban corruption plot that was revealed in early this week, has been imputed.
As yesterday the SER chain informed, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore afored, was stopped by leaving Morales' domicile with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the subject of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signature of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to recalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, eight people are detained.
Bono accepts to head the PSOE candidacy for Toledo and preside the Congress if they win
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the upcoming general elections and to be president of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced in a press conference by the PSOE Organization Secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting he held this afternoon in the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The head of the Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he has pointed out that "yes seems" that the manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress if the socialists win in the upcoming elections.
Bono would replace as president of Congress Manuel Marín, who made public on November 15 his decision not to present himself to the next general elections and to abandon his career in active politics to dedicate himself to fight against climate change in the university.
The former minister has acknowledged that the President of the Government has not ceased to insist that he should return to the political avant-garde since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he said that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will preside the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the position, Bono expects to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or scream." and make it "look more and more like the citizens."
“Sometimes unfortunately it seems that the only local in Madrid where you can’t talk with tranquillity and with suspicion is Congress, the president of the Government on a certain occasion interrupted in the Senate 26 times.”
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "good doing" and has not wanted to be seen already occupying his position to not fall into what, as he said, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to immisericord persecution of both the skeptics of its predictions and those that prioritize other political and social battles, it is forced to show a coherence of iron.
And more a leader of the movement who is president of the Government as Zapatero and believes that that struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach obliges him to explain why the action, or the inaction, of his Government have contributed decisively to Spain heading the EU in non-compliance with Kyoto.
Who are the responsible for the non-compliance, in what sectors it has occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, he demands to explain with the greatest clarity to the Spanish what measures he will take to stop climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizens’ habits should be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be obliged to do, what economic consequences it will have.
That is, who will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been and there will not be such explanations.
It’s just because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, real measures, are impopular.
Costful, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the penny of gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he has rushed to deny it.
That is, that it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of all real consequences.
With shocking phrases, committees, committees, protocols, new positions.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that neither talks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the meetings and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a merely virtual contractor and does not intend that we move on a bicycle or refresh ourselves with the valve.
Mayor and head of Totana local police arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murciana town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the municipality and a hostel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have today.
The edil was arrested at his home and has been moved to the Consistory, in whose dependencies it is at these moments along with numerous agents, who have also visited the Municipal Council of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of Industrial Soil and Housing.
These three detentions are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the recalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic soil in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 houses, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Totana Court number one.
The first six detainees have been sent to court today.
According to the sources, the former Totana councillor and today autonomous parliamentary of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has resulted imputed, just like the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who resides in the capital Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, agency integrated in the Group mentioned, and through which the summons would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the detentions, practiced eleven records, mostly in companies related to the detained and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
A single person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known bird products company in the region, who could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing the largest residential complex in the Murciano municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired in Totana 2.2 million square meters of land that were recycled and its project would duplicate the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the viguese parking of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, dedicated to the sector of direct marketing; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of elements of construction.

If it seems to them, we’ll leave to rest the Book of the Month, to see if there is another ‘premiology’ and other competences.
I’m already scattering something.
Life is change, people.
Of course, you are invited to propose inventions.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us this comment on yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (for example in the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which makes reference to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of the book of Blackburn:
“The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to the public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The guilty of the deaths, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Platon and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Platon and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the mandatory basic course of philosophy in the institutes.”

A colleague passes information about the introduction to the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
Instead, if you steal discs in the store for a value less than 400 euros, it is considered simply a lack (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the steal is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the imposed on the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous kidney has a penalty of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would have a penalty of six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code)
Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a DVD film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the author's authorization is more punished than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is getting the hand, a very long hand.

My doctor leaves me one of his articles on rare research titled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less.'
That is, that the feelings that the monthly wage of the workers generates depends on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been carried out through tomographic magnetic resonance at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Image of Neurocognition group at the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if they both got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one got the double, the activation was greater.
I don’t know if this conclusion requires so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been persecuting war criminals in the Balkans for eight years from the prosecutor's office of the former Yugoslav Criminal Court, located in the Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will go with an agridulce taste, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica – in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died – the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic, remain in liberty.
His names are on that list from which he takes his title the Switzerland filmmaker Marcel Schüpbach's documentary, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not released in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Switzerland prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to pursue the escaped criminals and press the governments involved to stretch the circle.
What insurance is suitable for me?
The car insurance, which covers the driver before possible crashes, is an important expenditure that will depend on various factors, such as age, gender, card age, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of this, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First we have to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is materialized in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange that it is responsible for the obligation to pay the compensation in case of accident.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, gender, age of the card, civil status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to this, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of the statistics, so that at greater probability of suffering an accident, greater quota to pay.
It is for that reason that both the older 25 and women have to pay lower primes, as statistics reflect that they have a lower sinistrality index due to their prudence.
Also, taking hand of the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and therefore the likelihood of having some kind of percance.
As the frequency increases, the probability increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies take into account when setting the price of the premium.
It is therefore that the driver must study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits your profile.
We will expose the most significant variables here when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 find themselves with various inconveniences when hiring an insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the carnet age.
Although the ideal thing to be well insured is an all-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most precaved drivers can choose all-risk with franchise, so that they get the coverage of an insurance at all-risk but at a more factible price.
This type of agreement would imply that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sinister.
“The part of the amount of the accident that the customer provides will be pre-established based on the value of the prime, which will be higher as low the amount is,” said Luis Noguera, top responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an extended third-party insurance, so that the customer is guaranteed protection against damages caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A counsel.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid crimes to the extent possible, as this will impact on the bonus, which can reduce the cost of the insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company possesses.
On the contrary, a penalty is a recharge on that basic fee.
“The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the benefit of the company.
If the company has had a good year, it will be possible to increase the bonuses,” Noguera clarifies.
After the 25 year gap, drivers have it easier when hiring an insurance, since the sinistrality index is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a whole risk with franchise.
“Normally young people can’t make use of the previously acquired experience when it comes to an accident, and even when driving,” the director in Spain of the European company says, adding that most of the accidents occur in the second year of driving, once passed the ‘fear of the novice’.
However, if the customer is married but still has no children it is preferable that he negotiates an insurance at all risks, as long as his economic situation is permitted, of course.
Marriages with children are considered by the insurance companies as the public with a lower sinistrality index, so the recharges will be less.
In this case the best insurance would be one at all risk with franchise (will be this of 300 euros), or, when a high level of bonus is available, one to third parties extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury of assuming a greater quantity of franchise,” Luis Noguera said.
For retirees it is recommended a risk insurance with franchise (as this is 150 euros), or one to third parties extended when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver before possible crimes, but also because it represents an important expenditure, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point worth the eighth in Milan.
Milan and Celtic meet on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point they lack to their respective goals in the closure of the Champions League, as the Italians serve them to be first and the Scots to judge their classification.
The Italians add ten points and already certified in the fifth day their pass with an empate in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and that receives the Benfica, who has four, does not advance him.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before it ends the whole sixth day, since Milan has to compete the World Cup in Japan, where it starts on the 13th day in semi-finals in search of a place for the 16th final.
So, this group will be closed before the rest and the match in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and a better cross in eight would be assured.
Gordon Strachan could even serve a defeat to classify if the Shakhtar doesn’t win, but he won’t be able to trust because at the same level of nine points the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
Thus, the milanists will try to burn the night to the Scots, who trust to get in eighth for the second time in the re-structured Champions League and consecutive, after they were precisely defeated in that round the past campaign with a goal of Kaka in the prolongation (1-0) after the 0-0 of the ida.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in the event that the Celtic loses, both to get in eighth as well as to follow in the UEFA.
And it is that the Benfica, despite being the last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach the third place with a victory, with which the UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first Spice Girls tour concert in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started in Vancouver, Canada, with about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) announced shortly before starting their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilliant".
Around 20,000 people exhausted the entries to see the concert that included a video that tells the story of the group that made furor at the end of the 1990s.
The meeting and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls members came out to the stage lightening some bracelets that Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham, had given them.
The athlete was among the audience that broke the GM Place, despite the fact that Victoria's nerves had banned it days before.
Victoria Beckham said the British star "has not seen our dressing for anything, so I'm nervous about what it's going to think about the show."
"Sporty Spice" whose departure in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m happy to have made the decision,” Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that, over time, “the things have been fixed and we want them all very much.”
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last played together in 1998.
According to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a Virgin Airlines special plane.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babies was waiting for them.
Among the five there are seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
The event will be held in Madrid on December 23.
New Fears About Gas Between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it affects fuel exports to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every blow between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices, Russia will have to pay higher traffic rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of the gas, Gazprom, trying to agree the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for the Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it will charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas that comes from the neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
“It’s important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks,” Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
“The changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a decline in exports to Western Europe, which rapidly raised prices.
Russia’s gas is a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not fully developed yet.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet nations of Central Asia.
NHS will have to test foreign workers
The Scottish NHS needs to control the criminal records of employees outside Europe, a watchman said.
The general auditor Robert Black's recommendation came after it was verified that a foreign physician was related to the attack on Glasgow airport in June.
Black also showed his concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff it has.
However, his report pointed out other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The general auditor checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area as a result of the attacks on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after shooting a jeep at the door of the airport terminal building.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey for a video conference in October, accused of alleged bombing car attacks in the UK.
NHS expects to carry out the pre-employment checks to candidates, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the general auditor recommends, among other measures, that the meetings should have the guidance of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside the UK.
"Al we find some of the personal records with evidence of these checks, this is not a routine review," the report says.
Black declares that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights the areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff.”
Scottish BMA President Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
“The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it’s not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made,” he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreigners, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the general auditor warned that the number may be higher, in part because the meetings have trouble identifying who employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were widespread.
This includes passport checks, work permits and qualification checks.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners at the NHS.
The secretary of health, Nicola Sturgeon, said: “I was very interested that this work was carried out as a result of the Glasgow airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health councils, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the updating of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – what they had planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about Joy Division's late vocalist, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for the best film.
The trophy was also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and coprotagonist Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond's protagonist, Daniel Craig won the variety prize for putting a British film on the international stage.
The prizes were delivered at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows the rise to Curtis's fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in white and black - containing soundtrack from The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds.
But also won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic character of the U2 album Joshua Tree, awarded two awards – best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the center of another awarded at the ceremony – like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, won the award to the best documentary.
The best actor award was awarded to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a head of the Russian mafia in London, in David Cronenberg's film Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation of playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to British cinema.
The Fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequence of Indiana Jones "The Kingdom of the Crystals".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, named so in honor of Harris, the star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it’s really an honor.”
Independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa fans and mecenas include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrested 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who planned an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The state television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning the missile counterfeiting.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants composed of foreign residents planned an attack on a oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 soldiers to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement from the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert", who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to enter the country by contrabando of eight missiles.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active to stop Saudi travelling to Iraq to join Al-Qaeda as militants to fight against the allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiite government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunni.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants – rejected by the calls of Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader born in Saudi Arabia, to harass the pro-west government of the country – had as targets residents of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, for five months of work," the Interior Minister's spokesman told state television.
The detainees also include a “media cell” of 16 people in Medina, whose objective was to promote “takfiri thought” – the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unbelievers and apostates.
The arrest includes another 32 people accused of giving financial support and support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of the Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more similar to a Earth twin than previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to dive lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and rays storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offer a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It is being clarified why the weather on Venus is so different from the Earth, when they are two so similar planets.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario in which Venus began like the Earth, possibly with an habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police arrest “enriched uranium”
A kilogram of radioactive material, which they say is enriched uranium, was decomitted yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for 1 million dollars (480,000 pounds).
It remains open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow monkey.
However, Republican candidates for the presidency eventually access to hold a debate on YouTube, in which common and regular voters record questions in video and send them for their dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions submitted in the afternoon of Wednesday 28 November were more ridiculous than that of the snow monkey who asked the Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected a lot of the state of the Republican party in the face of the next year’s elections.
It is unknown exactly how CNN producers, who co-patronize the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to aspirants.
But the first half hour debate, the longest dedicated to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecised voters to rise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peak approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest words exchanges of the night were given between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been the point in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire surveys.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was blank with illegal immigration when he was New York mayor.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when they were asked if any candidate could support a "amnesty" (allowing the illegal to regular their situation and giving them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached an agreement on the issue.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the race because both alerted about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general, candidates share points of view: increased border surveillance, intolerance to illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns for the outside, helps the Republicans forget, or minimize, the divisions between the Liberal and the Christian Conservatives.
But the debate turned into uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported weapons control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered a torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in every word in the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to trouble towards the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonas and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now, against all expectations, first in the latest Iowa survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservation – said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer if Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too intelligent to be a candidate in the election.
The race is unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee increases in Iowa, in conjunction with the fundraising campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and his heated statements of Wednesday's debate.
The two have gone out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not reach an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about America’s greatness, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the match is divided and the result is far from clear.
Working pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold influences, neither is it about exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor is it about outland fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, of more than 650,000 pounds (1,3 million dollars), for four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling for an election, stupidly insulting the British intelligence declaring that opinion surveys did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with growing ingenuity, because the feared Mr. Brown has passed from being Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
The rescue of Northern Rock, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judgment poverty in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code has put business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative fool.
A trio of retired generals initiated a motin in the House of Lores, protesting against the cuts in the military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now are the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary (and former Complier) has already resigned.
Nothing of this means Mr. Brown goes irrevocably toward the exit.
Governments can get to an inflexion point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their incredulity when a new lot takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister can’t improve things, that it doesn’t have much time, that suspension is more: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is put to the defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is difficult, because unlike other political leaders it cannot defend itself by argumenting that it’s new.
Although he wanted to renounce Tony Blair, he was his top tenant.
The Northern Rock problems and authority registration tax, are related to the decisions that Brown made as chancellor of the erario.
And even when it’s not directly engaged in the contracts of Blairish – or “money for partners”, the research of the financing of political parties – voters can assume that if it’s so.
However, Mr. Brown’s situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
Like Mr. Bean, no one has died, nor has been scammed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist trends have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with charity gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not taken by him.
The laws against anonymity for big political taxpayers are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abraham’s agreement, and that this was not illegal, obviously will face Jon Mendlesohn, head of funding, who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown so far is not involved: there is nothing that suggests that he knew of these performances, although the thickness of the payments was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
It has been quick to condemn its party for violating the law, but it dilutes in decision making for a family matter, a commission of investigation on the matter – led, to a good extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the moralities are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter of the police.
Moreover, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for a genuine reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the Labourists with the Tories, and a renunciation to the special financial situation that it has with the trade unions – bitter measures for a partialist like Mr. Brown.
But he has to deal with some party facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the surveys; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probability and a strong competition.
The Tiger Card
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that some dorsal aletes swim excited around.
Today as the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes put on the country’s credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts calculate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis contains other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already seen.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of the salds that have not been amortized or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charges in its U.S. consumer financing business, in part due to the weakness of card lender.
However, it is too early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historic average.
The deterioration in the rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the American bankruptcy law (2005) led to a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a great loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore, of morosity) would be growing again, or it may happen that the conditions for borrows were worsening.
The industry also reports solid pay rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emission volumes for the year 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of infection of the crisis between the subprime mortgages and the credit card market surely exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit entities are expanding.
But credit card issuers look more on the liquidity flow than on the active values, so falling prices do not necessarily act a change in the credit capacity of borrows.
They can even work to advance the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the value of the loan; and as a result, the payment of the card debt rises on the list of priorities.
Card emitters can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, by changing interest rates or by changing credit balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid reset of assets.
“We’re not going to wake up a day and re-evaluate all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, head of finance at Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained drop are much more real.
If housing prices are lower and a credit contraction pushes America to recession, the industry undoubtedly faces a harder future.
We need to keep observing these dorsals.
British bankers convicted of Enron case
Three British bankers who went to trial for their responsibility in the fraud with the former head of Enron’s financial office, Andrew Fastow, were declared guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for colliding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before the U.S. district judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was sentenced as guilty of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish PLC group at the Royal Bank, became a famous case in Britain for the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, his case marks the foolish end of an investigation launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have warned in 2002 to Fastow that it was the target of a government investigation on the fall of Enron.
The accusation against the bankers - doubled the "NatWest Three" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, which was the craftsmanship of a miria of fraud in Enron, which helped his falling spiral in the bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary at zero, but the three British knew it would value at rise.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its subsidiary parts.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the accusation.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced guilty for two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has been sentenced to six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is executing a three-year and one-month penalty in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay $1 million they needed to live in the United States while the trial was held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the country, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make his failing business seem successful.
The collapse led to the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in retirement plans.
Enron's founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were charged in the past years for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is fulfilling a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow.
The price of a Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expenditure for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
“But no one requires that model of so many seats because it is for family private flights or for presidents of a company.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millennium Fair, a four-day consumption orgia held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, another 200 luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from caoba crafted yates to the diamond-incrusted car grills, worthy of 50 cents.
Mr. Firer cautiously looks at a bright orange Porsche in the stand near his own."
“It’s a nice car, but it’s nickel and calderilla compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft.”
Provided of fuel by the rise of oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was on top.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some acaudal American came to gather in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“As the Saudis of the 70s and the Japanese of the 90s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s largest consumers and consumers.”
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, this week a conference on the luxury industry will be held with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the company New York Times)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-degree wealth includes 103,000 Russian millionaries whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists of the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of the Russians were situated below the level of subsistence.)
"There are hundreds of millionaries in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, the London Jewelry.
She attends the fair for the first time alongside the brand’s Russian distributor, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are impeccably prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in afternoon dress, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and them themselves as millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design costume I used as a network carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new wealthy, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum shorts, Mövenpick ice cream, ordered swimming pools, Dubai apartments and Gund Teddy Bears.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically on a stand of the Dutch royal porcelain Delft, in front of a wall-size reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand painted bullets.
“Naturally, the Russians are more interested in the ‘bling-bling’.
In fact, sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from striking logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exhibited at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: cash millionaires, millionaires emitters or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
Some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, chief executive of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000 matrix systems each, made of silk, cachemira and cotton tightened with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, Chairman of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain-shaped car grills for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with incrusted rays of Swarovski color crystals, so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants avestruz leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes, won’t necessarily drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He will keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase "Russian billionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the price wave of real estate.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you're probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it's not in cash," he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British style) telephone cabins filled with bills of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millennium Fair.
Visitors stopped shaking pills of money, asking their friends to take photos with their mobile phones while resting on a lot of money, or packing up a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
"chapuza" surgery could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw a ambulance rise through White Cape Cod, two doors below on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a car from the police patrol appeared.
And then another.
“Then I saw the ambulance rise,” said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that Wednesday.
“There was when I knew that someone was dead.”
The authorities learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41, assistant of the director of the Newark police department.
Now researchers are trying to determine if she died due to a procedure carried out by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the house of the 212 of the Av. West Scott.
The authorities are not yet determining what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test although the results will not be available until a few weeks.
Mrs. Arroyo had been assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, working and tired,” Mr. McCarthy said about Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
“She was my guardian.”
She protected me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two 14- and 11-year-old children, and a young woman.
Eileen Walsh, spokesman for County Union Prosecutor, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives are trying to determine whether Mr. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
“This is one of the possibilities,” said Walsh.
“This is an ongoing investigation.”
The police said they arrived at 3 p.m. near the house.
On the 21st of November, they met Mrs. Arroyo in a sofa.
He was declared dead in the place.
It has passed more than a week and the authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say if Mrs. Castro has been interrogated by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door in Mrs. Castro's home, where a rosal marchite is located on the front of the house, and a dalmata ladra on the back.
A blue drum labeled as "vainilline ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfume - was on the door of the carrier, next to a door that leads to the underground.
Two mountain bicycles hang on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of an inestimable help to get to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch with this or that,’ she said.
She was always here when I was, and also when I was not.
It is pregnant.”
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock exchange
The shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm credit conditions with interest rates cuts, which increased with the calming comments of the U.S. Central Bank vice president.
The stock exchanges flooded in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two of Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policy makers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued tension of the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets in the midst of rising amounts of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said the recent turbulence was “particularly invested by the market improvement at the end of September and during October.”
If the rise trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into the U.S. markets and to make subsequent interest rates cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
The observations also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, which is equal to 4% of its total labour, in a global cost reduction to compensate the losses of its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of the Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, at the closure to 13.289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the closure to 6.306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of Britain's top companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, it was highlighted the reappearance of credit tensions in the markets after a strong demand in a three-month lease of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered that loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds in the London securities markets, stressed credit and three-month "Libor" loan rates among British banks, meaning the highest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a constant rise since November 12.
England takes over the lawsuits of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit the No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important in front of the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the team that is borrowed- with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris' desk, director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector, and if not, in a part-time.
Who doesn’t get the sixth place of battle will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and sport too.
It is not easy to throw what a man does on the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of lack of luck more than by ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, because judgments are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it right for Shah if he does it?
The same question could be made in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good degrees and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the table: there is only a place for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricket player unless they give him the opportunity to swim or swim at the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to capture the captain’s eye at the same time taking a “wicket” and a beat to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have an impact as a player someday.
But capturing the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who plays in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declares himself for “fit and bowls” as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win one place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of these.
The Shah or Bopara games at the Asgiriya stadium can be just a question of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who came to become a player of importance, and despite scoring a hundred-double against Australia in Australia, it may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at today’s session at the Asgiriya stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favour Shah’s greatest experience over the exuberancy of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favour of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut test of the early 88 in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class against only 6 Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against the spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two rounds in May against West Indies in the test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, it seemed to have taken from his “batting” something of elan than in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team has the joy of living on the swords.
He is caught for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summarized as when he rolled his vehicle at an exhibition for the British car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was to get out of his Vodafone (patrocinated, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who looked away, to tell him with excitement: "You saw that?".
Bopara is the best player, it’s including his slurry pass to have effects on his games that seem to satisfy him, because he bats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Per that is the true art of the selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his opportunity, which doesn't mean that Shah doesn't stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, it's he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work and fight Al Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began to arrive in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who remained in cash, without visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some even had returned to fight against the militants who led them out of their homes.
At Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus on a government official convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
“I’ve returned today for what I’ve seen on TV and what I’ve read in the newspapers, about what’s happening in Baghdad and that’s safe now.”
“They say that Mahdi’s army has ceased to kill people,” he said, referring to the Shiite militia of the religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentan cessation.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa to Syria because the regime doesn’t want the Iraqi people working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by telephone to tell him that a U.S. allied force helped pull Al-Qaeda out of his bastion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newly arrived from Jordan was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from his home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the support of my companions.”
“It’s why I’m back today,” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the U.S. troops strengthened groups of “occupied”, armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighbors.
But many said they have returned for the denial of visa and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi people have settled in recent years.
51-year-old Salam al-Samarrai, a father of three children, gave voice to the common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite Prime Minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country due to the sectary squares of death.
"We were well until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
“I can’t believe a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunni have been expelled from the Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will make sectary tensions arise again and the struggle will begin.
The little boy, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in professional training and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, Sarlandese lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fifth time to a non-Sarland that we are not French,” that was the ironic motorcycle on themselves of the smallest federal state for its fifth-year-old.
At the same time France and Luxembourg have a great role in the educational system of the Sarre which in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
Thus, higher schools traditionally have good relationships with neighboring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today students can finish their university career here with two or three degrees.
Consequently, the percentage of foreign students is high, of 15, 6 per hundred.
However, the number of students from Sarre is above the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bachelor's degree.
“In the Sarre the system of professional education is taken advantage of,” says Axel Plünnecke, the educational sector expert at the Institute of German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people make their bachelor's degree in the Professional School. So, it turns out that the Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical professional training and a growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of the Sarre forced higher schools to make more advertising for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we’ve made some reforms in general education schools,” a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
So the government introduced comparative tests throughout the country.
In order for children to start as soon as possible to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", this has no cost.
The comparison with the upcoming studies will show if the students’ performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students delayed in school development decreased from 29 to 20 percent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
For the disgrace of the Sarlandese, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could good results.
Although the Sarlandese are not French, the neighbor's language is a mandatory subject in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chávez changes the time.
Soon there will be a different time gap in the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez left the time in South America by delaying the clock for half an hour.
Nowadays, Chávez is remaining like a comic in Spain.
As the Venezuelan State Official Bulletin has, according to the new law, the time will pass at less than four hours GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a time gap that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States would impose on his day the obligation to the world by changing a full hour.
Moreover, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break of relations with his neighboring country Colombia due to the action with hostage.
The left nationalist said he would not maintain any relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative Álvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do it," Chávez says, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could enlarge its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision made by Uribe by withdrawing Chávez's mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of the refugees.
On Sunday, Chávez said criticizing that the decision Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
There is a lot of talk about Chávez in Spain.
A new tone of calling causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you silence?", is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was pronounced by the King of Spain who felt annoyed by the continuous interruptions by the left populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the real wage decline threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a real wage decrease threatens German employees despite a strong counture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic forecast.
According to the Hans Böckler Foundation calculations, German employees should have a lower real wage account in 2007 than the previous year.
“The fault of that is the weak salary evolution, the increase in added value tax and the stretching of food and energy prices,” Gustav Horn of the Institute of Macroeconomy and Research of Economic Cycles told Bill.
The new unemployment insurance burden can also be paid to employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to decrease the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% by passing from one year to another, is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the work office doesn’t have to get back into an unpleasant situation, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
On Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
Compared to last year, prices are rising by 3%.
Venus is the Earth’s Twin Brother.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the planet most similar to the Earth, something that has not yet been proposed.The European "Venus Express" probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolins in the poles, the same that appear also in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had the suspicion that there could be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new tests: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays walk at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, Cris Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles tells the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller life, the rays caused life on Earth: storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on their part, would have given origin to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
In Venus it is not so: if there was life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there cannot be life on the surface of Venus: the atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface reigns temperatures of 500°C, oscillating in such a way that temperatures below zero can be reached.
“Probably, Venus is a ‘diabolic’ twin of the Earth, but it’s still a twin,” Russell said.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for the research of Venus.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many “Nature” articles, according to the researchers’ opinion, emphasize not only the unity of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also demonstrates that neighboring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had supposed,” the ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers discovered in the south polar region also a vórtice formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon reminds of wind flows in the high Earth atmospheric layers of the poles, according to a team of researchers by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has a mass almost equal to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost so large.
This planet is also called a star of alba or a star of evening orbiting around the Sun for 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is equal to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much similar to Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets water had been aggregated that in the Earth was left in the oceans, but in Venus was dissolved in the universe.
While carbon dioxide on Earth had become carbon stones, Venus forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the struggle between the parties for the reception of Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the great coalition end that struggle for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
“In this case, we should not present ourselves as a divided nation,” Koehler told “Handelsblatt”.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Democratic Christian Union) in September.
"Al I have a great respect for the differences between cultures, human rights are of absolute validity for me," Koehler said.
Everybody knows that Germany has to act with great balance in measuring foreign policy, the Federal President emphasizes, defending Merkel for the rejection she received by making a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of One China’s policy.
China knows it too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social-Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust for the reception of Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticized the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The Dalai Lama's reception at the Federal Chancellor's office caused great misunderstandings in the Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Foreign Ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chief Government of China, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians receive the Tibetan religious leader in its official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that he is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that disturbances like those that occurred in France will occur.
Battles with police on the streets, shootings, car burns: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that disturbances will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that everything is done to ensure that social insatisfaction in Germany is not moved to the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals shot with rifles to the police: after serious disturbances protagonized by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Democratic Christian Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We must also make sure that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form.”
"This we have to take it seriously," he said in the newspaper "Neue Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The Federal State, the federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruits.”
It is still too early to set the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that the German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as it occurs in France.
The young people took part in serious disturbances on the streets with police in northern Paris last night.
In Tolouse cars and public buildings were also burned.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the disorders in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
However, the actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people under the age of 25 is above the average.
It is necessary to ensure that there are more professional training jobs.
Kolat emphasizes: “We have to give a perspective to young people.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is a great social control in the families", greater than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But despite everything, we have to be careful.”
It is necessary "to provide the opportunity to young people to receive a job or professional training more quickly."
Meanwhile the night in the parish suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police participated in the action, a helicopter with phars overflowed the territory.
The authorities three detainees, as well as waste and cars burned.
Since the previous day, a team of 1,000 police officers is taking care of the security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Internal Affairs, announced that the police will take rigorous measures until it is necessary.
The night from Monday to Tuesday, about 80 police officers were injured by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the next night in Tolouse.
The disaster began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people were killed.
According to information provided by the prosecutor's office, the death of the young people was not due to the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, demonstrates that the coalition in terms of content has reached its last point and that there is no need to expect anything more from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate action, indifferent and untouched in the general debate of the House of Representatives, it must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made for repeatedly devoted to foreign policy actions, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptive phrase.
He said that it would be a provincial way and so he showed he made constate that he doesn’t want to understand what interests the critics.
In the Lower Chamber it was declared very clearly to all that that reproach was appropriate.
We could not feel a minimum of interest, nor any kind of feeling for the problems of the country.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented itself in this way: a very high policy that flees into foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: climate change prevention: he praised himself very much for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but he says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising itself—for two years the head of the Party of the Democratic Christian Union has not been able to allow so much modesty.
They are trying to make an impulse to the people.
And thus it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke the internal problems are appearances of little value.
Children’s poverty and worries about low wages workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talking about that topic using subordinate prayers.
It’s impressive how many times you’re mistaken when talking about the supplement for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good phrase.
It begins to throw "as if it had been in an unknown territory", when it was about more concrete information.
The attack section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a warmed debate of Republican presidential pre-candidates on YouTube and now have to fear only a candidate from the outside.
The tensions between the candidates have been seen from the beginning.
Mitt Romney reproached his opponent Rudy Giuliani that he had turned New York into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants."
This, on its part, replied with serious reproaches: "I would say that his own home was a "port" for the illegal." Giuliani replied to the former governor of Massachusetts saying that he was the one who employed the illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: As the Republican group has not yet a clear favourite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate at CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small videos of 30 seconds, rooted by internet users who were sent to Youtube, also don’t have much content.
"With this way of isolation we let Hitler get to power," this was John McCain's reproach to his opponent Ron Paul, the only of the meeting that insisted on the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives many criticisms from the veterans of the war in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by leaving a person drowning simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise of taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
“At that time I was wrong,” Romney explains and asks forgiveness to the people and the television audience for being a advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, didn’t know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time without uniforms.
One day after his resignation as head of the army, the Pakistani president made himself swore as president.
This is the end of the eight years of military government in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has sworn for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony in direct at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his mandate as head of the army to his confident Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after it was made with power with an incruent military coup, the former general governs the state for the first time as a civil head.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the west.
The other requirement is the end of the state of exception, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's general prosecutor, after the oath Musharraf will cancel the state of exception very soon and will meet the second condition of the West.
Since the state of exception was proclaimed at the Supreme Court there have been many Musharraf party lawyers. Last week the country's Supreme Court rejected all the lawsuit before the controversial new government chief elections on October 6.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the Northern Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s follows its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-print, a copy of "Live 1974" was made, which was written at the best time of the band.
At that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen to an official meal caused the feeling.
Each of them has its box, its cables, and above all its buttons.
In the middle is sitting Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
Right, looking from the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
It doesn’t seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock enthusiasts was the fact that the Harmonia band would make music again.
What must be rebelled here is the following: the questions with accuracy have shown that the band’s name was still in people’s minds, but it wasn’t something so special that after 32 years the audience was so missing it.
But why can the Germans not also praise their living legend of the 1970s?
Especially because the Krautrock mistake was always more valued in England and the United States than in its own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a music award "Echo" to members of the Can 2003 Colony band for their work of life, the room could see the surprising faces of the German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouth with surprise.
Later Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been a old friend (from the band).
The ignorance in your country and the recognition abroad are one thing.
It's a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at those times I didn't a great effect in the public, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
For a while ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and they had a name, Cluster, which promised a lot of fame.
At first they played in the Berliner Schaubuehne underground.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf which was patronized by a church.
For a while, Rother had a workplace at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist at the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at those times was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster musicians in the exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in the Common I, where Roedelius could complain of his position.
That was rather an artist’s life full of surprises.
According to them, one day an association flag of Ottenstein's Harmony sing appeared in the rubbish, which resulted in a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in the use of the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist was not just to get to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert at Griessem. Someone reminds that, in this recording participated 50 people.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do from time to time trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is contrary to the customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended with themes of esoterism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived the eighties and since that time has had more success than Harmonia had.
The live recording of the album on Griessmer, that you have to thank Groenemeyer.
Her music company Grienland set its goal to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like Roedelius' work, the band Neu! was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures from the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase accompanied with special music fills the room: “This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a farm.
The story of the legend’s development is shown in white and black photo projections, where instruments with cables are seen.
In the background there are three veterans who began improvising again.
They do nothing more than fixing the microphones to the organ and the battery to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is the way it should be.
Three people deepen in the technique.
But that doesn’t change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere it tosses, laughs and in a good moment of emphasis it sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
It was never rock.
It was not sought the origin of the gender in the blues, but in the music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or escaping from the artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Whoever here screams “68!” is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
In the scene, we think very well about what is already obvious.
Where does music begin and where does it end?
This can break the nerves of one or give a quick moment of luck.
Richard Gere only lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are dedicated again to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have much conviction.
Or the concepts are fixed a lot on actions and shootings or the two movies are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can also not help in this case.
At the beginning there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkans, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the War of Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
Finally we had lost sight to the most beautiful man of the eighty, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and little-important roles in women films and after many press conferences about Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the film "The Hunting Party - when a hunter becomes what he pursues" (Why today the titles of the movies have to be so long and foolish?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the sight: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He would be a man whose best times of life have already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decadence retained so far most of his charm.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, result to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war on the Balkans.
You can narrate the movie "Moerderischer Frieden" in a few words: it's about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serbian from the Kosovo franco-shooters, one of them acts very quickly and that leads him also to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented again as the only guilty.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway, but in war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because in reality there was never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
At another time, with another director and with another scriptwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about the U.S. reporters in the war who go to detect a war criminal Serbian called "shark", probably could be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and every time it is a mad journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning we are presented to Simon Hunt, who doesn't let him be simply a heartbreaking cynic.
No, the script also predicts a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnia who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with an impressive speed achieved what they couldn't for five years the NATO, the CIA and all the world's heads hunters, which went to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to revenge in a fair way.
It’s so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadžić and Mladić are still free, and highlights that Americans and French are not really worried about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous Brecht poem.
In this poem it is about a mask of an Asian demon: "In the big wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be evil."
In films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they demonstrate how hard it is to be good.
The problem consists not only in the genre of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all the films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiasco.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always a rule is worth: when a star gets through a crisis region or through the mining fields, then appears something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Per all of these conflicts occurred in a short time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood runs a good film about the Holocaust taking as an example the film "The Schindler List".
Classics such as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated by unanimity as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that’s why in our times every massacre (Massenmord) comes presented directly on two TVs at home.
And that’s because the scripture authors don’t have the least repair (which is necessary to be able) in narrating good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" resulted in the end so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know how bad the Nazi regime was actually.
Maybe you don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Maybe you have to be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look from an artist.
When asked him about the parallels between his historic novel "Diccionario de Lemprière" and the War on the Balkans, he replied: "This is only because some things don't ever change."
Great cities will always be in danger, men will always be killed cruelty, and in Yugoslavia the war will always reign.
Von Beust receives as a response the negative criticism of the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue fighting for the competitions in the aquatic sports section.
But Beust reminds that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, head of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that resignation was "not good for the economic location."
In recent times no other project in the big city encouraged so much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
“Without this goal we could not maintain the political, sports impulse at the same level.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, mayor Ole von Beust kept his statements that the ambitions of Hamburg in the organization of the Summer Olympics would not be achieved until at least the year 2028.
“Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympics, but it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports,” says von Beust on the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) that is expected to begin December, on Munich's application for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which we so far thought to have until 2028, from a realistic point of view we will not have any opportunity.”
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut's statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
“It’s too early to leave the opportunity, if at this time the plans are ruined,” said HSB’s director Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the request is contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate he made at a reception on the occasion of the General Meeting of the German Public Sports Federation of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust designated Hamburg’s 2015 university application not as a “substitution” to the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Higher School Sports Federation named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) reproached the Senate not to take such valuable time for building houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate delayed with the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympics or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, Deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always demanded an integrated Olympia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU emphasized the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
They are not wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but doesn’t think of Andy Warhol.
or yes?
Currently, wood boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the nine-four Bright-Box "type" in this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper “Expressen” raised doubt about the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes by Andy Warhol, the Museum of Modern Museum of Stockholm conducted internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six “Brillo-Boxes”, which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Museum of Modern Museet, are false, and one hundred of the others of “Type Stockholm”, which are in circulation on the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York their first "Bright-Boxes", painted the wooden boxes of red, blue and white, with the same sample that had soap powder cards "Bright".
According to Warhol, in the 1968 exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum were exhibited hundreds of Bright-carton boxes. These were not made by Warhol (for the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Bright" carton factory.
It was not an artwork, but an exemplary (which were only objects) exposed.
In the same year, in 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some bright wooden boxes, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now talk about almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Bright Boxes" of "Type Stockholm" authorized by Andy Warhol.
In auctions some of them were purchased for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous director of the museum Pontus Hultén made false statements that in the year 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left them to him.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At this time Warhol had already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Museum of Modern Museet, investigated six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the paint was applied with a roll without directly printing the pressed dishes.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol’s official Bright-Box list,” says Lars Nittve, the director of the Museum Moderna Museet and adds that if the “Andy Warhol Art” Authentication Commission in New York will not come to any conclusion, the Museum Moderna Museet will classify these six boxes as the copies/objects of exhibition.”
In July, the Authentication Commission officially announced that it accepts these “graves accusations” that it is about soap powder boxes.
But from that moment there everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebels rush in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebellion soldiers who had stumbled in a hotel in Manila and had demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo have surrendered.
Head Antonio Trillanes, who rejects the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not respond for bloodshed.
Soldiers who were faithful to the government had attacked the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers were stumbling for a few hours in the building.
Nearly half of them, among them Trillanes, had a Thursday trial for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that suddenly he could deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who had to watch him had passed to his rows and followed his motin.
They entered the hotel "Peninsula" and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood near the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent session of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security counselor, condemned the behavior of the soldiers.
“People are tired,” Trillanes said.
“We invite people to pass to our rows.”
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the Scout Reangers elite troops, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Great government critics called on a large demonstration against the president on Thursday.
For months, the government has been charged with corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all attention by the motin that was tried against Arroyo.
The rise failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts of state strikes against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet assured more than 20 percent of the telecommunications company Versatel’s shares.

That meant that both companiesined all the options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
