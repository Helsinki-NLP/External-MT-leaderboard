In my view, the literature program was shaped by the Balzac-age ladies based on their interests.
From the 19th century Russian literature we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of those same ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torture of the Tolstoy and Turgenev heroines is not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Maybe the roses were plush to represent a certain variety?
There are roses of this color and with a structure of petals that resemble velvet, usually dark red, bordellous tones.
The light roses look different, the petals have a silky or atlas-like luster.

The mattress is a Promtex Micropacket Prestige 105x195.
The "Micro-Packet Prestige" model is comfortable and natural.
The mattress has different hardness of the sides: medium-hard surface formed by latex coconut fiber and natural latex, moderately soft  plate of natural latex.
A spring block with 1000 springs per square meter quickly adapts to the body of a sleeper, preventing the appearance of a "wave" or "hammock" effect.
Among the advantages of the model, you should highlight the breathable materials.
The latex, perforated for air permeability, is naturally well ventilated, just like the coconut bark.
This helps to maintain a healthy microclimate in the bedroom.
The mattress also has an extended warranty period.
The official manufacturer's warranty is 5 years, but the actual mattress is longer.
Protection from dust and dirt is provided by a detachable jack-card case, which is supplied as a kit.
Add orthopedic pillows to your mattress. They are recommended for maintaining the optimum position of the spine during sleep.

Andrei, you were clearly told that the schools are staffed by retired women, they will not work in the command line.
The computer science teacher can't help either, he hasn't been taught, the schoolboy plays window games.
So there's no support.
I remember with horror the banquets and the guests at my parents' house.
Guests are on the doorstep, and the kettle is still on the stove, and Mommy is cleaning the floor.
God, I was so tired sitting at the table.
And then you wash the dishes, clean the house.
You bring food a week before the holiday, two days of cleaning, the day after the cleaning.
What about the guests?
They're fine, and they're gonna have to bring a cake.
I've been a little bit uncomfortable with the holidays and the guests ever since.
Even for my family, I set the table at the minimum.
And I make them desserts, baked goods, very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth vaccine against coronavirus is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be needed in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough to provide complete protection.
The head of the General Practice Association, Ulrich Weigelt, is convinced of this.
This was reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be needed in the summer, at the latest in the fall", the expert believes.
In addition, Weigelt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination can be done "in combination with influenza vaccination".
This will help you achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help fight the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus, Omicron.
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
So, the likelihood of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with the Delta or Beta strains.
This is shown by the results of a preliminary study in South Africa.
Based on this, manufacturers BioNTech/Pfizer plan to provide a vaccine adapted for Omikron by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A BioNTech and Pfizer study found that two doses of the vaccine were significantly less effective: "the neutralizing potential was reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the omicron strain", BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
That's why we need a third dose.
Experts are pushing for an accelerated vaccination rate in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, advocates shortening the time between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"Israel's experience is very convincing", the expert emphasized.
The Vobler Pontoon21, the Bet-A Vib, the 54 Silent, the 54 mm, the 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib Series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created with the use in mind for underwater fishing, not just for catching brown trout.
These vibes have a larger specific gravity than their size-related analogues, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of strong and elastic plastic, which creates additional vibration shades for vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when catching a hedge, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is the simple monotonous animation, that is, the up-and-down movement of the stutter almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, overwhelmed by underwater vegetation, rows and other obstacles, over which a trap is possible.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for the winter swordfish and the large octopus, and especially in the middle of winter, when pointed and aggressive lure is required.
Once it reaches the end of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly turns and returns to the original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is also used to catch pond trout in winter.
To suit her whims, you can choose from two modifications: with a noise capsule (NS  NanoSound) or without it (SL  Silent).
It has also been noted that Bet-A-Vib is able to irritate a passive sting that does not respond even to a sting.
When caught, Bet-A-Vib shows range and accuracy.
This wobbler is easy to understand and does not have any caprices, it is well combined with wood and even large diameter knitted threads.
For the catch of the stork, the stork, the stork or the stork, the "stepping" is also relevant, sometimes with a "chircan" on the bottom.
If you're fishing in tight spaces, you can change the front triangle to a double, which will reduce the chance of a trap.
Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in its class of decoys, and as a result, one of the most captivating.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively small and in rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.

In Libya , they said about 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are over 7 thousand mercenaries in Libya from the private military company (CVC) Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Supreme State Council of the republic Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are now over 7,000 mercenaries in Libya.
They have planes.
They're also digging trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet aircraft at the Gardabia airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", - Anadolu Agency quotes him.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save the presence
According to the interlocutor, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "deployed in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufre, the agency's publication noted.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PLC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be operating in nine African countries - CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use mineral and natural resources, as well as to supply arms, technology and military services to these countries", the article says.
According to the media, the "Vagnerovists" allegedly fought in Donbass, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and CAR.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies, nor in the registry of legal entities, and its fighters are not in the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Recall that 27 EU countries have approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the European Council on December 13.
The situation in Libya
Libya's Supreme State Council is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with the Islamists dominating it, TASS writes.
This body has repeatedly called for the single voting day for the parliamentary and presidential elections to be moved from 24 December to at least February 2022.
"There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances of them being held on time are rapidly decreasing", the article notes.
Against this backdrop, the Libyan Electoral Commission has postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports Sky News Arabia.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria, we protected, restored peace there", "the decision on the "Nord stream-2", "the whole world was frightened, that cool armament", "Crimea we repressed".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", according to the research of the Public Opinion Foundation.
Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services are now digital
The Dubai government has announced a complete abandonment of paper-based casework and a move to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitisation of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a completely paperless government", the emirate's crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, chairman of Dubai's executive council, said on Saturday.
Now, all internal and external documentation in Dubai's government agencies will be done digitally only through special information platforms.
The innovation affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing and communal services, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitalisation of documentation has started in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, the authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million man-hours and 353.8 million dollars in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, the dates and ages of the kids, that's a bit of a stretch, class and group in kindergarten, too.
I can't believe there's such a thing as a "squat".
And if they do, they don't care about anything, including their family.
My mother, her two brothers and grandfather lived with my grandmother at 3 Vladimir, there was 1 floor without grilles.
They knocked on the door, then on the window, then decided not to do the ceremony, broke the window and went in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat, which they got.
These people knew there was someone in the house.
Turkey 's car production and export fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and export fell sharply in November amid the devaluation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's 11 month performance was worse than last year's, Bloomberg reports, citing figures from the Association of Turkish Automobile Manufacturers.
According to the association, 115 thousand cars were produced in Turkey in November, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,9 thousand cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year's figure.
And if the automotive sector of Turkey showed positive dynamics compared to last year in the first 10 months of this year, then in the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMBs received credit payments deferred in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation in providing benefits for small and medium businesses, Kazinform media correspondent reports.
"According to the information of the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, this year, in fulfillment of the Head of State's instruction of April 1, 2021, the Agency's Chairman's order of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About approval of the Order for postponement of payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his reply to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities to grant deferral of payments on loans granted until April 1, 2021 to SMEs, including IPs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days, depending on the SME's choice.
The borrower's application could have indicated a different deferral period.
During the period of delay, the claims and claims work in relation to the borrower were suspended, the notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the commission and other payments by the creditor", the Deputy Prime Minister noted.
In 2021, 603 SME borrowers received applications to postpone payments on loans to the second-level banks, of which 553 SME subjects received a postponement of payments for a sum of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SME subjects submitted applications for the postponement of the tender, of which 95 subjects were granted a postponement of 105.8 million tenge", - concluded A. Smailov.
Pulmonologist Puryasov suggested that people with weak immunity can easily carry the "okmiron" strain
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate it more easily than those with a strong immune response.
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasov explained why the "okmiron" strain of the coronavirus may be dangerous.
The reason is to be found in the conditions of the virus' origin.
Scientists believe that the ocmyron was born in the body of an HIV-infected or immunocompromised person.
So, when he mutated, he didn't encounter any resistance from the immune system.
It makes him more aggressive.
With no response from the immune system, he got very fast.
Apparently, he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than they should be, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - comments pulmonologist Sergey Puryasov.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate octopus more easily than those with a strong immune response.
It turns out that the body's strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when young people die at 30 and old people at 60 in the form of pee.
The young man's immune response is furious, he is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with your finger, he strikes like a gun on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasov.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, the second can often be treated with only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - fever, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, a sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia may start vaccinating the younger generation, aged 12 to 18, before the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFI Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contacts.
This is the most socially active group, as well as the children's kindergarteners, - said "Moscow 24" Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of the MFI.
A huge thank you to the author for this article.
It's a pleasure to refresh your memories...
Teath-In. What is it?
In those distant seventies and eighties, no dance floor was without the melodies of this group.
And at home, at a gathering with friends, they would have dances to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why obese people are falling victim to COVID.
The researchers studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, and they showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also studied the fat tissue of patients who died from COVID and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It's known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir to try to avoid the immune system's response.
And SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of that.
Biologist told about the causes of dementia
Biology candidate Semen Goloshekin has given the reasons for the onset of dementia and told about the ways to prevent it in an interview with Sputnik radio.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive function - over time, a person has difficulty finding his way even in familiar situations.
Goloshekin noted that most often, dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins.
There are certain factors that increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioural level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role", he said.
Other harmful habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders, and a sedentary lifestyle - also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"There is some debate that hearing loss may be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for its development", the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor of the department of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the Federal State University of Applied Sciences.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive disorders department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnologies, Anna Bogolepova, spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned nearly 30,000 artifacts illegally taken out of the country
Over the past 10 years, the government of Cairo has managed to return to the homeland some 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, in the Al-Hayat TV channel by the chief inspector of the Department of returned antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt, Shaaban Abdel Gawad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to return 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C., has discovered 5,300 ancient Egyptian relics", he said.
Abdel Gawad clarified that all the artifacts smuggled out are registered in the archives.
Department officials are working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that when they return, the cultural values will be restored and then put on display in museums.
He said that one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the exhibition at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities appealed to Interpol for help in locating the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, which was sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held a sale on July 4 where the bust, which is over 3,000 years old, was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amon, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic got to Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate the antiquities illegally removed from the country at various times.
According to the authorities, 95% of the contraband antiquities are the result of archaeological searches by "black diggers".
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that's right, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that's how many Tatars (Kazans) live in the Crimea (see census).
The Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants to get access to employees' personal mobile devices
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, reports the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as those are used to resolve business issues with colleagues or clients.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, with many employees switching to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not commented on the new claim.

Part four
The last year of Sergey Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside any literary associations, spliced with imagination, he is himself, but famous, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even malicious, but the reading public is ready to carry him on their hands.
Over the course of a year, he wrote more than 60 poems, many of them real masterpieces, completed the cycle "Persian motifs", wrote the poem "Anna Snegin", published 8 books, the collection "Soviet Rus".
The main success was that in late June 25, the State Department signed a contract with Yesenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets Sergey Alexandrovich has been so honored, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the monthly fee was 1000 rubles for 20 months (the director of the factory, for example, received 300 rubles a month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed more than ever that year.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sofia Tolstoy, and had to provide for his family, his sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seems that life is getting better, there is something to rejoice about, but for him everything is painted mostly in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Esenin) had materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very ill. I'm not going to be able to sleep.
I don't know where the pain came from.
♪ The wind is blowing
Over a deserted and uninhabited field,
So, as I grow in September,
Alcohol is a brain drain.
Many people I know said that Yesenin was very tired, he looked bad, obviously sick.
More and more people are having gout, nervous breakdowns.
And the reason probably isn't just alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made to Sergei Alexandrovich by someone, there are no reliable documents left.
Let's say, in May 1923, when Yesenin, at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Aysedoura Duncan, was recovering in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (who returned to Yesenin two years later, in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's drunkenness, scandals on this ground, the police arrests are abundant - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the early 20s, the poet's horror romance with the green snake has been developing rapidly.
In late summer of 1923, Yesenin settled for a short time with his friend, the imaginist Ivan Starzev.
Surprisingly, with his very good income, Yesenin never had a home in Moscow or St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, hotels or at friends.
The elder recalls:
"I only came in to sleep, and most of the time I was in a mad, drunken state.
One day, on his way home at four in the morning, Yesenin fell down the stairs...
He was falling, scratching his face and growling.
"When he regained consciousness, he coughed incessantly, splattering blood all over the sheet"...
Yesenin himself, after a trip to Europe and the United States (then the law was dry in the States, but Duncan had brought a decent supply of alcohol) confessed:
"I saw nothing but the streets and the cobblestones...
I'm almost done and I don't remember people...
Well, and drinking, of course...
I drank because I was bored".

My son is almost 16, and he hasn't had a blow job in a long time.
All his energy is focused on choosing what he's going to do for a living.
He's a lot more responsible than I was at his age or my husband, who had a run-in with the law before we were married.
A father is taking care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov said, "with a strange love".
Why did the girl cry at the exam when she didn't fail it?
Why didn't he tell his daughter it wasn't a school?
She's got a tail.
So what?
The transfer.
Millions of students know that.

Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus is using migrants as "weapons" against the EU
Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as "weapons"
Poland's deputy foreign minister, Pavel Yablonsky, expressed the opinion that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as "weapons" against the European Union and intends to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the same statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus have temporarily "suspended Lukashenko", but he is "actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official also said that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
As kp.ru reported, the European Union had previously imposed a fifth round of sanctions against Belarus.
It involved 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they have declared readiness to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk responded by imposing a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions on Belarus.

"Not in the Shadow of the Hat": When a velvet jacket makes a man a laughing stock
The 2021 secular events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "Not Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet-rimmed jacket and a traditional "Bondo" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not conform to the royal dress code at the Earthshot Prize award ceremony, and then chose a more classic version at the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi tried it on himself.
The football player came to pick up the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet Dolce & Gabbana jacket.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same.
AliExpress already notes a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, which was received by "Gazette.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with underlay and a silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy exclusively jackets - they choose sets of velvet suits less often.
You can't just buy them at online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are available in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is Gucci, in which brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared on one of the premieres of the film "The House of Gucci".
When choosing expensive brands of jackets, you can be sure that the silk is made of silk.
The special technology of weaving threads produces a dense fabric with a wrinkly outer texture and a smooth inner side.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakoshkin warns that in the case of velvet jackets, the key is not the model or the style, but the relevance.
"The velvet requires evening light, so it is ideal if you are going to a party or a special event", explains Vakhoshkin. "It is also suitable for those occasions when the invitation includes the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion for choosing a velvet jacket is the status of the buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket should first get a proper, advanced party with a good deal of money", the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Brammel's Pretty Boy" say. "The men in velvet jackets usually belong to the caste of people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to a secular event where a dress code is always displayed.
Ilya Vakoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same decorative items: classic pants with arrows, one-ton shirts, silk ties, loafers with brushes, and zippers.
Too simple and everyday things will seem inappropriate.
Fashion experts at Brammel's Beauty believe that it would be inappropriate for a corporate employee to wear a velvet jacket, but if it is "a leader among those who run this event", then "yes, he is into that stuff".
If an employee is of lower rank and his goal is to move up the company's complex hierarchy or to win financial bonuses, it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely evaluate this with the phrase "not by the Shadow of the hat", - believe the editors of Telegram-channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous sensations from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, it's so painfully drawn.

I don't understand the admiration.
But I wish you the best of luck with your life.
It's all about money -- alternative energy is well-lobbied, so it pays off.
Billions of dollars in investment.
Are they sad?
No, the electricity price went up.
Traditional energy is also not in the top spot - gas, oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
Fuel is in high demand.
The penny's dripping.
Who's in the gutter?
As usual, a regular buyer.
Does the sheriff care about the Indians?
So we shouldn't think of Western politicians as idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good salary.
I didn't see any of the pretty people in the article.
Just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Maybe if these characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it off to the whole train, they're not going to fit in.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful (s)", but certainly not because of their looks.

A slave whose saliva flows when he complacently describes the delights of slave life and admires the kind and good master, is a hop, a ham".
Immunologist says revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the "omicron" strain of coronavirus
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against a new strain of the coronavirus infection "omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination in six months, given the appearance of a new strain, "a very long period".
"In previous strains, this was the norm, but now it is best to do the procedure in five months, and in people with chronic diseases - in four", the expert said, calling for revaccination alongside the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been given two vaccines and a booster, or if he has been vaccinated and has been overcome by the disease, or if he has been vaccinated and has been overcome by the disease, then he has received a 'hybrid immunity', that is, he has received many and enough neutralizing antibodies", the expert said.
The Big Seven warned Russia of "scale consequences" in case of invasion of Ukraine
The countries of the "Big Seven" (Great Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada, the United States, France and Japan) issued a statement following the meeting of the foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and cost" Moscow, but the document does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's military buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine", the statement said.
The ministers further urged Russia to "loosen the escalation, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activity", as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine", the G7 foreign ministers also said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited under international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return", they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response", the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
She said the meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of the world's GDP, and which made it very clear that an invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer vaccine found 32 times less effective than omicron-storm
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus is 32 times lower than other types of the disease.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original variant of Sars-CoV-2, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant", said Professor Malik Peiris.
The scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against severe disease during coronavirus infection.
Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have previously predicted the spread of the coronavirus pandemic based on the impact of the omicron strain.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine accused the Federal Republic of Germany of blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Alexei Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's purchase of deadly weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to destroy drones.
It is noted that later Berlin softened its position on rifles, recognizing them as a non-lethal weapon.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the above-mentioned weapons within the framework of bilateral agreements with the allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the authorization of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect arms supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of the Federal Republic of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is confident, Germany will keep under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said Kiev expected help from Berlin in equipping its naval fleet.
Ukraine expects Germany to be "Ukraine's partner in the technical sense", the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the "green" party of the Federal Republic of Germany, Robert Habek, visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

Mercedes has filed a protest against the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result
The German team "Mercedes", whose driver Lewis Hamilton finished second to "Red Bull" driver Max Ferstappen at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, filed a protest against the final result of the race, the press service of "Formula 1" reports.
Mercedes believes that the Formula 1 rules 48.12 and 48.8 were violated during the race.
In the first case, the German team disputes the decision of the judges to return the circuit racers to the same lap as the leaders.
According to the second, Ferstappen had overtaken Hamilton to the "restart" zone.
We'll add that now the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix result, according to which Ferstappen beat Hamilton by 2.256 seconds and won the Formula One World Championship, is preliminary, when Mercedes' protests will be considered, is unknown.
G7 warned Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
The G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to the final statement.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the strengthening of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs", the statement said, published on the UK government's website.
The G7 ministers and the EU's top representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed escalation and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine".
British Foreign Minister Elizabeth Truss warned at a press conference in Liverpool of "big consequences" for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We've made it clear that any invasion would have far-reaching consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon its aggression against Ukraine", she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier, at the G7 summit in Liverpool, foreign ministers agreed that the parties needed to return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis over the buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.
It was a Normandy format negotiation.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the "Normandy format".
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "have signed off on their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

The return of stolen money through online stores has been revealed
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses when the data of a bank card gets into the hands of hackers, it is recommended to keep the main funds on the card or bank account that are not used in online shopping.
You can put some of your savings away and withdraw them as needed.
Experts also recommend a separate online shopping card.
If money was stolen from a store that doesn't use 3D Secure security, you can start a refund process.
"Under the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions conducted without using 3D Secure, the responsibility is placed on the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service", - said the representative of Promsvyazbank.
Expert from international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to file a complaint with the bank to contest the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be challenged and the money refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the money to the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, the member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet, Ekaterina Mizulina, reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received on various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to theft of personal data.
She said that an effective solution under the current circumstances could be to create a single complaint window for online fraudsters.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
Germany's newly elected chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops at the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian gas pipeline "North Stream-2".
Although Scholz declared his desire to preserve good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said he will urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
Moravetsky believes that Russia could use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to enter the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve the crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
The new German government, sworn in on Wednesday, despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made a public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an agreement with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invaded Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials have not confirmed the reports, but Scholz warned of the consequences if Russia violates Ukraine's border on Wednesday, and this position was confirmed by the G7 on Sunday.
Dmitry, look more closely.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
The wall between the kitchen and the room has been removed, so you can see the second window in part.
And those who are not familiar with the initial planning are generally skeptical.
I know these apartments very well and I can see how they've been re-planned.
May they be well.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the windowsills, the faucets.
You wash them once a year at Passover, which is a must.
Just don't let it get dirty.
The Ministry of Digital Affairs wants to give writers residencies
The future Russian Literary Support Fund will receive the federal property inherited from the Union of Soviet Writers and the USSR Literary Fund.
Writers' residencies will be established on its basis, the foundation's founder, Mincifra, told the "Parliamentary Gazette".
The Ministry of Digital Affairs is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Russian Literary Support Fund.
The explanatory note specifies that the foundation will be tasked with taking care of, among other things, the purposeful use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union of Writers and the Litfond.
"A significant number of objects of immovable property, previously belonging to the USSR Literary Fund, including objects located in the town of writers of the Leningrad region, Komarovskye village and others, have passed into the ownership of the Russian Federation", - reported "Parliamentary newspaper" in the press service of the Ministry of Digital.
The draft decree prescribes that the Foundation's charter should state that it is "created to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers".
"Creating conditions for creative activity" means creating writers' residences in different regions of Russia on the basis of the property being transferred, which would have comfortable conditions for creativity", - explained the Ministry of Digital Affairs to our publication.

The chief prophylactologist of the UrFO, the scientific head of the Society of Specialists in Preventive Medicine, the doctor of medical sciences Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU that the Russians are now often using anticoagulants before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens believe the questionable advice on the Internet and start self-medicating.
There are people who decide to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And when you do a pre-vaccination check, the doctors notice that you're bleeding.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without finding out the cause of any symptom.

The guy who found the money in the church wall gets a $20,000 payment from the plumber .
The plumber who found the money in the wall of a church in the US state of Texas is getting a reward.
This is according to a press release from the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred at a major Lakewood Evangelical Church, where pastor Joel Austin is preaching promising wealth and prosperity for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Cowley was repairing one of the church's toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He gave the find to the church and, he said, didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, "You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you did and what you could have done", he was quoted as saying by KPRC-TV.
Apparently, the find is related to a theft that happened at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks that were kept in the church safe were missing.
The money was insured, so the church didn't suffer any losses.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was announced for information on the perpetrators.
Justin Cowley couldn't claim this amount because the award had expired.
Despite this, the nonprofit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time had a $5,000 reward and later received another $20,000 in donations from Lakewood Church, decided to reward the honesty of the plumber.
He's going to get $20,000.
It was previously reported that police were questioning Pastor Joel Austin about money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.
Tanya, her words, her actions, that's what characterizes her as a real person.
That's why people are so negative about it.
And it's not like, "She's the richest of all the pussycats", as they say.

Brazil requires citizens to show vaccination passports when entering the country
In Brazil, the government has mandated that everyone entering the country must have a Covid passport, according to a decision by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF), Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from presenting a certificate.
Also excluded are those who have arrived from countries where there is no proven vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious when Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's Eve, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourism", Barroso said.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities had required unvaccinated tourists to observe a five-day quarantine.
The scheme of complete protection from COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, Russian science worker Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection from the coronavirus infection.
He said that this could be achieved by injecting and using nasal vaccines.
When used internally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced. When the vaccine is injected, this does not occur.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus can't get into the body.
And inside , after vaccination , we have the most immunoglobulin G .
And if you give both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no decision yet on double vaccination", the doctor said.
The head of the UrFOs, Dr. Sergey Tokarev, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the possibility of ceasing to be a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because in such a case, the body's defenses should presumably be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov stated that the spread of the new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to him, this is the picture in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, you know...
I was talking to the dead goat, and I said, "If you're willing to trade a warm home, a feeding tube, a caress, love and play for a liquid bitch, go ahead".
But the clown was trained and smart.
Picked my company and went home.
The video shows a method that works 90% of the time.
It's not a high-end, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, even though they were saying that there were 200,000 running (gunshots), I just took his hand and led him in the other direction.
The 200 grand ended up choosing a master, not a dog that was running away somewhere.
Mass protests against vaccination continue in Europe
In the Austrian capital of Vienna, more than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the restrictions and the authorities' plans to make COVID vaccination mandatory.
From next February, those who are not vaccinated will have to pay a fine of 3600 euros.
Spaniards, outraged by the health care policies of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held placards that said, "This is a fake pandemic", "I will not get vaccinated".
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a COVID certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of several regions of the country against the background of the increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action started peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
A group of protesters started throwing stones at the police.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia has no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.

I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans only brought death and looting to any country wherever they appeared.

WHO has detected "omicron" in 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the new "omicron" strain of the coronavirus has been detected in 63 countries.
Experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO report details the spread of the strain.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
That's despite the fact that it's only been active since late November.
The WHO also expresses concern over the high rate of spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain may outpace the initial estimate of the Delta strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus that is now leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that "omicron" will supplant "delta" in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone will be about 1 million, despite the fact that the official "omicron" is currently infecting several hundred people in the Kingdom, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the omicron strain, and at peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
Which the British healthcare system will not be able to handle.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain is 32 times lower compared to other types of disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V responds to Omicron is still unknown - it will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamalaea Center has just started testing the Russian vaccine on the "omicron" strain.

Russians warned of new scam
Hackers began looking for new ways to cheat video messages.
The Izvestia newspaper reports this, citing experts.
According to Zaura Aboutalimov, product director at Ivideon, the biggest threat to the spread of video communications is the use of fake videos.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real footage of the victim.
This neural network is able to accurately reproduce the behavior of a person.
Aboutalimov added that by using the dip fake, attackers can call the victim's acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of the person to send out for blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily trigger bullying, as a masterminded attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios", the expert said.
Alexander Vetkol, a leading Varonis systems engineer, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technology.
David, I'll have that added.

Here are five steps to prevent diabetes
Blood sugar problems are among the most common problems in the world.
However, some people do not give much thought to this, and they do not.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
For example, doctors recommend changing your drinking habits - reducing the amount of various drinks and switching to regular water have a positive effect on your metabolism.
Sweets raise blood sugar levels to dangerous levels when consumed in excess.
So the first step to a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and storing them in the house.
Not only is the food that we eat badly affected, but so are our habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to exercise a lot.
Experts advise that you should eat a low-carb diet.
Not only will this help you lose weight but it will also protect you from sudden fluctuations in your blood sugar levels.
To protect yourself from diabetes, you need to eat plenty of fiber.
Food fibers fill the stomach and thus help to induce a feeling of fullness, release digestive juices, and improve digestion.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "weekend migraine" in workaholics
Several factors can cause you to feel worse on the weekends .
The reason for the deterioration of the well-being after working days is often "weekend migraine", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research worker of the fundamental medicine faculty of the Moscow State University, scientific director of the Systemic Medicine clinic Zuhral Pavlova in his telegram channel.
She says that it is especially common for workaholics to experience headaches, fatigue, and weakness on weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that, in addition to the week's fatigue, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
On weekends, our lives are changed.
"We sleep long, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less", the doctor reasoned. "The lack of coffee causes a small crumb to start.
Overeating and lack of water - weight and frailty".
The late rising plays an additional role.
So if you wake up three hours later than usual, you get a reaction called jet lag.
It occurs when travelers cross multiple time zones.
To determine which factors play a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes most strongly on weekends.

South African scientists report low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "omicron"
South Africa says Pfizer vaccine against omicron is low-efficiency
Scientists in the Republic of South Africa conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of the coronavirus infection.
It is estimated that the level of neutralization of "omicron" is equivalent to the 22.5% efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic infection, which ... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, says the study text published on the MedRxiv portal.
The experts said that the drug could save from a severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in your regular foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrition.
An excess of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that a word they do not know may contain a hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition, and glycemic index.
There may be several dozen names on the label that are actually sugar-related.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (a sugar derived from corn), levulose (a fruit sugar), molasses (a black potato), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates, which are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be found not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, in bread, etc.
According to the Roscacherie, the most effective way to reduce sugar intake is to consume whole and unprocessed foods, and to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Sugar tastes different, but whatever the ingredient is called - whether it is syrup or nectar, whether it is processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar indicated by the manufacturer on the packaging, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. originally contain a certain amount of sugar.
So the total amount of sugar may be much higher than what's on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose its importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues to decarbonise its economy.
He said Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role", the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin supported Ukraine's energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline is not yet "in line with the requirements" of the European Union.

Hacker hacked the Twitter of Indian Prime Minister
The Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been hacked.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office has asked you to ignore any new messages.
The prime minister's representatives said they reacted quickly on Twitter, restoring access to the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's website was hacked in 2020 and urged to donate to the fund through cryptocurrency.
At the New Caledonia referendum , the majority voted against independence .
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonians voted against independence of their territory during the referendum.
The turnout in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) of those who voted were "for" New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96,49% (75 762) voted "against".
The turnout was 43.90%, with over 80 thousand New Caledonians participating.
As France-Presse reports on the interim results, "the outcome of the election was not in doubt", as independence supporters urged voters not to vote.
They were the initiators of the referendum, and opposed its holding on 12 December, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago was hindering a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists have said they will not recognize the results of the last vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is scheduled to speak on the results of the referendum.
The issue of New Caledonia's independence has been a major focus of the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favour of the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of European Union presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French", repeated Eric Zemmour.
A similar statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Peckress, who published a column in Le Figaro in late October, urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take up the position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

Turkey tests world's first laser-guided drone
Turkey successfully tested the world's first laser-guided drone.
The Eren UAV was tested at a distance of 100 to 500 meters, reports Mir24.
The device is capable of neutralizing explosive objects at a distance with the help of a laser.
The maximum flight altitude of the newlywed reaches 3 thousand m.
After passing the appropriate tests, the UAV should be put into service by the Turkish military, which will use it to destroy explosive devices without the involvement of sapers.
The agency emphasizes that Turkey is among the six countries in the world capable of developing and producing its own drones.

WSJ readers criticized the article about Russia-US relations
The Wall Street Journal's readers criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision for Russia-US relations.
The author expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he warns readers about the danger that comes from Moscow and makes a number of offensive statements about Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "come together as one front against Russia".
WSJ readers have expressed disagreement with the American professor's position.
"There is a lot of false information in this article", one reader commented to RIA Novosti.
"Europe is not ours to 'lose' and Ukraine is not our land.
The US and NATO allies will never enter into a nuclear war with Russia for Ukraine's sake", another noted.

A magnitude 5.2 earthquake has hit the Kuril Islands
The magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km to the north-east of the city of North Kuriilsk.
The fire was 92.5 km deep.
Earlier, seismologists recorded a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Peru, which injured 10 people.

Ukraine to start producing new generation of jet drones
The new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to produce ANKA-type unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
On December 11, the non-commissioned adviser to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Alexei Arestovich reported this.
So they're capable of acting against airborne objects, other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the hull and the like", Dialog.ua quotes him.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, Arestovich said that it is a jet, not a piston-powered UAV.
He said it was a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which surpassed it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestovich concluded.
The ANKA was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone has been carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff had classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems in the course of joint military operations in the Donbass.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky announced that the country had begun construction of a factory to produce modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a training center in the Kiev region, which will also test and service the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport .
Lions have escaped from Singapore's Changi Airport.
The Straits Times reports that the
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions, which arrived on one of the planes.
The newspaper notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the escaped lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the protective net that was placed nearby.
The standoff ended after the arrival at the airport of the Mandai Wildlife Group, the organization that manages all Singapore's zoos.
They've immobilized the lions with tranquilizer dart and plan to take them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier, it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion had escaped from its owner and was wandering the streets of the city.
The same day, the beast returned home voluntarily, no one was hurt.
Specialists warn of cancer threat from vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
Experts say that there is strong evidence that people who do not experience folic acid deficiency are less likely to develop certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer.
However, if the dose is exceeded, cancer cells will grow.
Beth Kitchin, a professor of nutrition at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, recommends that you monitor your daily intake of folic acid.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you deviate significantly from this number by a greater or lesser degree.
Kitchin recommends not taking vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's recommendation, monitoring the dosage and avoiding milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Nutrition consultant Rachel Fine has previously called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Because it is found in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat avocados more often.
In Britain , by April , the omicron-storm could kill about 75,000 people .
British scientists predict that the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus could kill up to 75,000 people in England in the next five months if restrictive measures are not tightened in winter.
This was reported by the Guardian newspaper, citing a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast, experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 there will be at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain in the country, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, hospitals will be accepting more than 2,000 infected people daily.
"Serious measures to combat coronavirus may be needed to prevent overloading of the National Health Service if the omicron strain turns out to be more contagious than the delta variant, and current vaccines cannot rule out infection", said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK's Health Security Agency said that if the spread of the omicron-storm continues at the current rate, there will be around 1 million cases by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1898 cases of the omicron strain of coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Health Ministry, Sajid Javid, said that the number could actually be as high as 10,000.

Demand for superyachts has risen by a quarter
Superyacht construction this year and orders for next year are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce our carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The world register of ships has 1,200 ordered yachts, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change-related efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress of 50 million pounds or more will not decline, writes The Guardian.
But they're getting bigger.
This year, orders were up 25% from the previous year.
The brokers say there hasn't been this much excitement in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many people who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own vessel.
The second cause is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas all these people used to go to the office and meet with their business partners in person, now the vast majority of them work remotely and do the zooming.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the shipyards are accepting orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
That means customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just want freedom, and the super-rich could afford it", he says.
Many in Western society criticize this behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The rich, sociologists say, don't want to understand that in a time of denial of space travel, life on yachts or private jet flights is a source of social irritation because the elite don't want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and are proposing new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they realize that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, not only is the number of superyachts ordered impressive, but their performance is also impressive.
Of the 1,200 ships, 27 have a stern length of over 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building a 183-meter-long yacht called REV Ocean.
When launched, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht is equipped with a "moon pool" and a submarine designed to explore the depths of the sea.
Helicopter platforms, open-air movie theaters, and a fighting platform on some of the existing superyachts, such as the wrestler McGregor's yacht, are common. Richard Wilk, professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University, says that the carbon footprint produced by the superrich is insignificant compared to the total amount of greenhouse gases they produce.
But it's symbolic, considering there are a little over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that billionaires have a carbon footprint thousands of times greater than the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emission trail was trapped on his 162.5 meter-long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the order to bring the yacht from, say, the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don't get people's sympathy when they, like Australia's richest woman Gina Reinhardt, who owns the continent's mines, complain through YouTube that their giant ships don't have a pier.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships 50 meters in length.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified that leads to the development of bowel cancer.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more alcoholic beverages a week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
The likelihood of developing the disease increases with increasing alcohol consumption.
In fact, men who drink moderately are at a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than women.
Scientists cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, but they do note that certain factors lead to a process that is harmful to the body.
Thank you for the worthy material and photo.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old
Many, or rather all, dog lovers believe that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't know how advanced four-legged pets really are.
For years, biologists have conducted various experiments to determine for sure how animals develop intelligence.
Although dogs do not have as extensive a vocabulary as humans, a new study shows that dogs can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or compose poetry, they have no understanding of politics, economics, or art, and yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Experts believe that some breeds are better at understanding human language, but statistics are not enough to draw accurate conclusions.
For example, some breeds are traditionally considered to be dog geniuses - for example, the Labrador.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and their ability to learn is no less than that of a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for US-Russian trade
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in his article for the "Glavred" edition.
He said Washington and Moscow are planning to resume talks soon over U.S. guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite U.S. President Joe Biden's words about countries' right to "go anywhere".
If you're offered something that's not acceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to bargain, you're just going to send someone.
And in relation to Ukraine, a bargain is planned", the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"Preparation is done in secret, quickly and immediately they go to offensive actions, and do not wait until the grouping is detected and the forces of resistance are deployed", he noted.
China is stimulating rail transport sector
China's advanced technologies have attracted the attention of companies from the US, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province.
The core technology developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allows trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, company spokesman Hou Zhaowen said.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and performance of the rolling stock.
China has significantly increased its railroad vehicle exports in the last six months, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May of this year, the first two-stage high-speed electric trains designed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary, and other European countries.
In November, the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began its trial operation.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the city center with the city's airport.
The metro line will be open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness", said Feng Yaosyan, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade Development (CCITD).
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of Chinese high-end equipment production in the world market", said Feng Yaosyan.
After more than 60 years of hard work, conducting a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system of production of equipment for railway transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosyan, the country is ranked first in terms of railway electrification and the operational range of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Goloshekin in an interview with Sputnik radio listed the early signs of dementia.
He says that the signs of future dementia could be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, to plan, to think abstractly.
There is now debate about whether hearing loss could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for developing it, the expert said.
Goloshekin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and cerebral arteriosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, early prevention is essential.
He said learning foreign languages and active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
WHO also recommends moderate physical activity, regular cognitive training through games and hobbies that require intense memory and logical thinking
"There are recommendations for the use of various ADDs, but their effectiveness and feasibility are still being debated in the scientific community", said Goloshekin.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intense involvement of memory and logic of thought", said Goloshekin.
Earlier, the UK's dementia research charity said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors have named early symptoms of Alzheimer's.
The first warning sign is vision problems, which make it difficult for the patient to recognize objects.
Another sign of progressive dementia, experts say, is aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toideze, who is part of the medical consortium created by the ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, changeability of character", the specialist said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to a special rehabilitation.
"We call this neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we did not find in Georgia", said Toideze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution, which is not available in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials disciplined him.
Georgian politics quickly succeeded in abolishing the punishment and restoring itself to its former rights.

These people are parasites on the body of society.
They don't work, they don't pay taxes, they live on family allowances.
They receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a working man feed?
We feed all the alcoholics, the drug addicts, who also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we're surprised by the increase in the retirement age.
That money could be spent on treating people who are really sick.

In Spain, protests against COVID passports
Protests against the mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate have erupted in Barcelona and Valencia, Spain, according to Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action was about 3 thousand people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for going to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
They used slogans on their posters to accuse the state of totalitarianism and urge respect for the choice of citizens.
Vaccination passports are also required in Valencia for entrance to entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in that city declared a medical dictatorship, and they called vaccination an experiment.
In Spain, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus have been identified since the start of the pandemic, with more than 88 thousand patients dying.
In Russia, restrictions are also planned for the unvaccinated.
The government introduced the draft laws on the unified QR code system in the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail establishments with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of infection or a certificate of vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

The Great Rise: How the Chinese Are Becoming Mountain Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create resorts of international level in the country
China hopes that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, raising the 1 trillion yuan targeted by President Xi Jinping, but also contribute to the economic development of the backward remote provinces.
Taiwu's ski resort in Zhanjiang, near the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction, the region is also undergoing landscaping: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
Many Chinese resort areas, including Zhanjiang, have snow problems.
The main long-term goal is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts so that all newcomers become all-time lovers.
But that's a long way off.
Justin Downs, the Olympic adviser, says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese skiing industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many years to create a skiing culture here, Downs believes.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, the high-speed railway from Beijing to Chunli was built, and now no one in the village is without a job.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling winter sports clothing and equipment.
On the slopes, there are food stalls with national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China is committed to building a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes should become leaders in major international competitions, and its resorts and equipment should reach world-class standards.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity's progress in universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage, which is celebrated on 12 December, WHO and the World Health Organization have published two complementary reports.
They noted that the pandemic had led to disruptions in health care delivery, and had caused excessive stress in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the immunization coverage of the population decreased, the mortality rate from tuberculosis and malaria increased.
WHO and the World Bank stressed that the pandemic had caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation puts more than 500 million people "in extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets".
In October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had left more than 100 million people in poverty, with more than four billion people virtually without social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister cut off from broadcast for "Democracy Summit" at White House request
Taiwanese Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion at the U.S.-hosted "Democracy Summit" was translated without video, according to a YouTube video of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, claims the image was deactivated at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map that marked Taiwan as a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan showed was compiled by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked countries around the world by the degree of civil rights protection.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", and the PRC, DPRK, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on the side of the map was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the U.S. government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources note that the map, which was shown by the Taiwanese minister, could go against Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize winner, "New Newspaper" editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money earned through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Don't get too caught up in the crowd. Bad people do happen. You might have a complaint against them.
But what does it have to do with the number of children, age, pension fund, etc.?
You write that they're "cold, didn't return money".
And how many and when they have children is none of your business until they're ready to hang those children on your neck.
And if that's out of the question, then what right do you have to condemn them?
I guess it's just in education, so...
The elected parents (themselves) dictate their own rules, frankly ignoring the existing ones.

China strengthens COVID-19 prevention and control in cities with land-based checkpoints
The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of the PRC issued a circular prescribing to strengthen the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in cities where land-based checkpoints are located, in order to further prevent the import of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in cities with land border checkpoints must pass at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document says that these requirements will be in effect from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that cities with land-based checkpoints and those that meet certain conditions may consider establishing buffer zones for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry spoke about the "sad conclusion" in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with "Izvestie" assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long road of cooperation has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not start yesterday.
There is one side of the negative predictability, but the side of any prospects for improvement is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion to come from the long road we've traveled with the current administration, and with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday", the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the US's desire to impose its approach on Russia on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk making optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington's position.
He explained that, except in areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress was observed.
Russia, meanwhile, is urging the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow is ready to restore dialogue with the US.
Virologist warns of dangers of nasal vaccine from COVID outside hospitals
People who have been vaccinated with the nasal COVID-19 vaccine may develop an allergy and need medical attention, so first vaccination sites should not be set up at airports or shopping malls.
This was reported by TASS by the virologist, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of the Novosibirsk State University, Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to set up nasal vaccination points at airports and malls, but I would only do this in health care facilities at first.
The fact is that the likelihood of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is low, but it is advisable that the person sits next to the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special sets of anti-allergic drugs that work literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary", Netesov said.
According to the virologist, the idea of vaccinating in shopping malls will be possible only when the experience of using the drug has been acquired.
He also stressed that when using nasal vaccines, it is important that they get to the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the person who is given the shot is sucked out after the injection.

Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continuation of "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including because of the alleged "invasion" into the territory of the country.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions on Russia without suffering", the Kremlin's official said on the "Russia 1" television channel.
Sands claims that "everyone in the world understands this".
Earlier it was reported that the US is considering the possibility of introducing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars in relation to Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
But Sberbank head Herman Gref is convinced that's impossible.

New Caledonia rejects independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the overwhelming majority of the participants refused to leave the French.
This was reported by the French BFM.TV channel on December 12.
96.5% of the voters voted against independence.
3.51% of the population of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean supported independence from France.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of the ballots.
The turnout was very low: about 55% of the inhabitants of the archipelago came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is explained by the calls of separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, the region held a referendum on independence.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the archipelago's inclusion in France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia a possession.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the New Caledonian government allows the region to hold a two-year independence vote.

WHO preliminarily considers omicron to be less dangerous than delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of decreased vaccine efficacy in cases of new COVID-19 variants.
As of December 9, Omicron is registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and significantly altered omicron antigen profile suggest a decrease in vaccine efficacy against infection and variant transmission.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it ("severity of disease" - ed.) may be less than less severe than "delta", "says the WHO technical message.
The organisation notes that so far all cases of omicron infection in the EU have been mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain is, according to preliminary data, spreading faster than the delta strain.
In Russia, two cases of infection with the omicron-storm have been recorded.
They "were previously immunized", the Gamalaea Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova, said that there are no reliable data yet that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine has named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-deputy of the Verkhovna Rada Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for the President of Ukraine Vladimir Zelensky in 2022.
He believes that the head of state may remain without Western support, and may also compromise on the Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko in a post on the portal "Glavred" on Sunday, December 12.
The first option, which Denisenko called "the perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will cease to be supported by key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
This development will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Parallel to this, prices for key goods that we traditionally export are falling <...> internal protests and the confrontation between the government and key FPG (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", the ex-parliamentarian added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine may compromise on the Donbass, which may result in a confrontation within the country.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, and the likelihood of such a situation, according to the former deputy, is up to 50-55%.
The third scenario in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the president and the population groups who disagree with Zelensky, which is likely to lead to the seizure of control over the power bloc and the implementation of "populist initiatives".
In this scenario, Zelensky will begin a "reformatting of the government", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is to turn Zelensky into the "father of the nation".
This could be triggered by an event that will cause a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from foreign partners and lead to an increase in support for Ukraine", Denisenko said.
This is possible due to natural disasters, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the polling data of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since he was elected head of state.
Analysts predicted a situation in which, in the event of the next presidential election in Ukraine, only 21.8% of voters would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for ex-president Petro Poroshenko.
However, only 19.3% of those polled expressed support for the president.

Arrested for a protest on Red Square poet: "For a quote of Yevtushenko 10 days give, here it is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A student of the Higher Secondary School was detained in Red Square with a poster that had the hashtag #poetvrosiyebolššíchpoet written on it.
This quote is by the writer Evgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was charged with repeated violation of the public action.
He was first arrested on January 23 at Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and so little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag", - explains Alexander.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to reveal more details about the message of his message.
How did the police treat you when you were arrested this time and before?
What did the department ask you, how did they comment on your campaign?
This time the staff was more correct, the detention was as long as possible, polite, as ridiculous as that might sound in some context of the word.
The OMONs were taking it hard on Pushkin.
They asked the standard questions, about motives.
When you heard it, you basically looked at it, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the four-sided monkey, it was perfectly correct, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after this action, even a few people start writing their own poems under this hashtag, I will spend the next 10 days in jail.

It's a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfect Russian and yet she uses the help of a translator.

Researchers have revealed how potatoes help fight age-related disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and trace elements that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol levels.
The root crop contains vitamins of the group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All of these elements help the body's systems function.
Potatoes also help to combat age-related disorders.
Because of its high cell count, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and if taken regularly, it can also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, to get the most benefit from the root crop, it is better to steam or boil it rather than roast it in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes could be dangerous for diabetics, as could other foods with high glycemic index.
These are foods that contain carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting the reduction of its production in private subsidiaries and the increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEK/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites on the runet, and most of them have ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, the general director of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - have managed to survive thanks to, among other things, regular domain name changes, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in both Yandex and Google search engines, you can watch pirated copies of Netflix's "The Squid Game" and Anna Melikyan's "Tenderness", the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated new "Encanto", but judging by the video quality, it's a so-called screenshot (a pirated copy of the film shot in a cinema).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, has the TV series "Universal 10 Years Later" on TNT (part of Gazprom-media).

I watched her interview, and the little girl said that her biggest dream was to grow wings, and her dad was always pushing her.
Well, that's all very questionable.
So I went to college, and then what?
The lamp is a Maytoni MOD081WL-L13G3K Tessara.
The wide circle, framed by light "molecules", provides the most uniform and bright illumination of the space.
The "atomic" or "molecular" design, which reflects the nature and natural essence of each object, does not lose its relevance and allows for profitable placement of accents in the interior.
One of the characteristics of such lamps is the weightlessness of the design.
Thin, almost invisible, ropes that adjust in height give the chandelier the impression of being floating in the air.
Metallic gold armature and matt-white miniature ceilings will easily complement any palette, and the hanging chandelier and bra presented in the collection will become a ready-made ensemble for lighting the living room, bedroom, hallway.
Well, taste and color, what's it called?
I liked Tarhun very much, not this one, of course.
The juices were very tasty in the high glass cylinders.
Three servings of syrup is too much for my taste.
Two of them were right on time.
The mattress is a Dimaks Micro Ultimate, size 160x190
The micro-ultimate orthopedic spring mattress.
The model is convenient in that it has two different surface softness  high hardness and slightly above average.
The product includes only quality and premium fillers, which have proven themselves exclusively on the best side.
Springs: In the center of the model is a block of independent springs "micropakets".
That means there are 2,000 coils per sleeping area that operate completely autonomously.
It's their functioning that gives them a unique point structure.
The "Micropack" is the most high-frequency of all the diversity of spring blocks of "Dimax", so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered premium.
Fillings: The springs are combined with layers of coyra and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If there's latex on one side, there's coconut on the other.
This tandem of fillings has long been considered a classic, since it gives the mattress not only orthopedic, but also anatomical properties.
If the coir provides the right support for the back, the latex provides the surface to fit the human body.
The case: The model comes in a folded, knitted Aloe Vera case.
It can be made removable or stationary, depending on the client's wishes.
The total height of the product is 27 cm, the recommended load per sleeping place is 170 kg.
Guarantee and safety: guarantee period  3 years.
The mattress has all the necessary certificates and documents that confirm its complete safety and reliability in operation.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, "Actual Camera" reported Sunday.
The goal of the missions, which will begin in five years, is to assess the viability of the clouds on Venus and then search for life there.
For the project, Tarugu scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of the Venus clouds.
Until now, it was thought that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic for life to exist, but Venus was probably originally an Earth-like planet.
The third mission is supposed to bring a sample from Venus.
Suppose we find life there, the main question is whether it's similar to Earth or different.
If it's very similar, it's obvious that life on Earth didn't start on Earth.
If it is different, then it is more likely that life originated on Earth", said Michkel Pajusalu, head of the Estonian Venus Life Finder project.

The metauniverse will change the Russian business
The topic of meta-settlers became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was going to be Meta.
This event was an important signal for the market: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that businesses in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in creating their own meta-settlements and monetizing them.
The metauniverse should be viewed as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend towards creating remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of isolation and limitations.
On the one hand, it's a result of the business' desire to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
With the third, they are the logical continuation of the trend of asset digitization, where any rights, securities, artwork and even money are going digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want to eat too much fat and too much harm.
Of course, we'll have the traditional olive and the velvet under the fur, but nobody's forcing me to eat everything at once.
You can have a spoonful, try it, and that's it.
After all, there are really ten days of rest ahead, where you can cook all kinds of delicious and nutritious dishes.
And how much hell she worked, time, resources, in training.
And after five quarter jumps, she ran out of gold.
And she also realizes that she won't last four years until the next Olympics, which means she'll never be an Olympic champion.
And anyone who wasn't just a sports person or can't imagine all the circles of hell she's been through, don't judge.
British economist couldn 't predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not predict 2022 because he believed such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the tide.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place is inflation, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the increase in commodity prices was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, it was clear even before the pandemic that "the world of infinite generosity of central banks has already exhausted itself" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates, taking into account inflation, will correlate with the expected growth rates of GDP.
O'Neill noted that the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies amid the pandemic could, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, productivity growth, rising poverty and climate change should be addressed, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, head of the global research department "Investment Opening" Mikhail Shulgin reported that the positive expectations for the dollar's exchange rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks to the dollar's exchange rate, Shulgin cited the Fed's monetary policy, the oil price dynamics and fears of the coronavirus pandemic.
I'm forced to agree.
But the good news is, if you compare yourself to yourself, five years ago, there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is made, but it's lazy.
There's another problem: there are many environmental initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.
All the eco-taxis that take out the trash.
It's a secondary feed point, a place for the marginal.
It's rare to find someone who brings glass and metal into the room.

Russians gave about 4.5% of GDP to auto dealers
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistical data from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI).
To understand the scale, roughly the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization heads of state meeting, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount is more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leader in revenues in the Russian market.
In 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars for the sum of 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
Kia's Hyundai brand has seen an even bigger increase - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
The brand is in the lead and the average car price has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles, while Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz have been the strongest.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands have not grown so significantly: according to the statistics of the Committee of car manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold for the same period by 9.4% more cars than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
The Japanese Toyota is closing the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms - Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with a 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (37%) and the average price of the car (almost 28%, to 8,2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is experiencing good sales growth and a higher average price than BMW, for example, and this is why the financial capacity is growing", said NAPI CEO Tatiana Arabadji.
The Chinese brands are showing fantastic growth rates, and they've also increased their financial capacity significantly this year".
Russian Lada shows average market growth (plus 28%), and Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months.
At the level of last year, the financial capacity of companies whose car sales in 2021 fell in pieces: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in a negative position - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand, compared to 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of auto components and interruptions in production, which covered the entire world auto industry, the auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "Autovaz" increased the cost of models Lada seven times a year, the last increase (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other car manufacturers regularly rewrite the price lists for their products.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car shortage, inflation and the desire of auto companies to recoup past losses are contributing to this, experts believe.
In the context of car shortages, I think many car companies have even been able to pass on to the consumer some of the costs of past periods that they couldn't put into the price of cars before.
- That's what VTB Capital's analyst Vladimir Bespalov says.
I think that financially, the automakers are doing very well right now, maintaining high sales margins".
An indirect indicator of this is the growth rate of the cost of cars, which is observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the opportunity for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth of the cost of cars slows down, car manufacturers will be able to get their income from the volumes, notes independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliyev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, carmakers are now seeking to make the most profit from each car sold, Burgazliyev notes.
The increase in the volume of car production is not expected at least in the next six months, while the excitement in Russia is heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
In the current market situation, cars have turned out to be a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a run, can now be sold for more than the original price, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about moving US troops to Ukraine in case of Russian invasion
The US leadership never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
This is the statement made by US President Joe Biden.
"There have never been any such plans", the White House said in response to a reporter's question about whether the U.S. had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that Russia would face economic consequences if the situation around Ukraine escalated.
At the same time, he stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also stated that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the U.S. will transfer forces to the Eastern European countries of NATO (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack from Russia", Biden said.
Earlier, the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading the territory of Ukraine.
He also said Moscow sees a problem in Kiev's use of Turkish-supplied drones, as well as "American weapons approaching our territory".
I walk away from these interviews.
If you're in an interview and you're forced to listen to screams, wait for hours, drink a strange drink and wash a cup, it's scary to imagine what's going to happen at work.

If a scammer calls from a number like this, like an "employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs" or another law enforcement agency, it's not effective to immediately drop it, and it's probably not going to be long enough to put it on the blacklist.
Because to prove his lie about his involvement in the power structures, he quickly repeats the challenge and continues to intimidate and persuade.
We need more useful advice for the people.
That's a load of crap.
I can't believe that happened.

And most importantly, they think everyone is to blame but the most...

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, I think you're, to put it mildly, off topic.
Only yesterday, the President of Azerbaijan approved the opening of the joint Azerbaijani-Russian KamAZ enterprise.
