MG Baltic case: new lawyer for Gustaini says he has not yet seen the case file
The eleventh hearing in the MG Baltic case was attended by all the accused: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the testimony of the accused.
At the last court session, the new state-appointed lawyer for Mr. Gustain, Alexander Doroshev, told the jury that he had not yet seen the case file.
The lawyer representing MG Baltic, Linas Belevičius, then stated that in order to ensure a full defence of the person, the Chamber of Judges must allow the new lawyer to access the case file and requested that the hearing be adjourned.
'In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must be familiar with the material of the criminal case.
It is not just a formal sitting", said Mr Belevičius.
The new lawyer A. Dorosev has not been able to read the indictment or the entire case file.
Earlier, at the previous court hearing, the suspect, Mr. Gustain, had announced that he would be relinquishing his lawyer because he could no longer afford to pay him.
The hearing also included audio recordings.
The lawyers for the defendants complained that the audio recordings presented to the court were of poor quality.
The prosecutor suspects that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Sejm and other state institutions, and also influenced the decision-making of the winners of public procurement, ELTA reminds.
The pre-trial investigation questioned more than 150 people, including more than 50 former and current members of the Sejm, several former ministers, and members of the European Parliament.
Over 200 surveys and over 30 rounds were carried out.
It is alleged that Gustainis received more than EUR 8 000 in bribes, Steponavičius - EUR 15 000 and Gapšys - more than EUR 27 000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and influence trading, the Liberal Alliance of Bribery, influence trading and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and influence trading of these parties.
It is alleged that politicians consulted with R. Kurlianski, Vice-President of the MG Baltic Group, on bribery and then proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Sejm or other institutions.
Ethics guards: the Liberal Conscience Board on the legal aspects of the Vilnius chapter
"The decisions taken by the board are in accordance with the law", its chairman Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the commission's meeting.
"Our decision was not a new one.
We had already made the explanation as a committee in July when the question of the Pages and Utens was raised.
We said that, according to the statutes, this was a matter for the board.
And if the board decides that some department can do what it wants to do, go with the committee and the board approves, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has adopted, then it's a decision that all the departments form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there's a chance to suspend membership and go with the committee,' he added.
According to Mr Tamoshyun, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October, the Liberal Party's Board of Trustees reversed the decision of the Vilnius City Council to participate in the municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the new list of the Buryam Election Committee.
In the opinion of the party board, the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party statutes, the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius chapter had to withdraw its bid to participate in the municipal elections with the committee list.
But Division didn't.
Former Head of the Chamber, MP Armonaitė Aušrinė has already left the Liberal Union.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Union Remigijus Šimašius, who has promised to seek another term as the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Election Committee "For Vilnius, We Are Proud of!"
He left the party too.
Municipal council and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
A tiger that had earlier mauled a man was driven off by a tractor by villagers in a northern Indian village, officials said Monday.
Mahavir Kaujlagi, a forest officer, said that after the tiger attacked a man working in the fields late on Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and drove the tiger on a tractor as the female tried to escape.
The villagers say that this tiger also attacked and mauled a young man about 10 days ago.
Min's village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve of the Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the state capital of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow.
The breeding of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
The Director of the Wildlife Trust, Ramesh Pandey, said that the case would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh state beat another tiger, who was badly injured.
The tiger is India's national animal; under the Wildlife Protection Act, tigers are considered an endangered species.
Last year, government data showed that at least one person per day had been killed in encounters with wild tigers or elephants during the previous three years.
Human conflicts with tigers have been steadily increasing since the 1980's, when India began a tiger-protection program that established sanctuaries in national parks and criminalized big cat poaching.
Although the methods of counting tigers have changed, censuses would show that the then population of about 1,800 tigers has increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Microschema marking is mandatory for cats and dogs
The Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose to make it mandatory to mark cats and dogs with underground microschemes.
'We propose that cats and dogs be labelled with subdermal microchips and that their registration and labelling be organised by the local authorities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so the population will not worry and the costs will be covered by the specially provided state funding", said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Parliament's Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the Act aim to address the systemic need for the marking of domestic animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid the problems caused by irresponsible farmers, illegal breeders or dealers.
It is provisionally estimated that, based on the expected average cost of the microchip and the service, which is around EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of the labelling of all pet animals can reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to be spread over three years and to reach EUR 2 million per year.
The labelling programme is expected to be funded through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will see a significant increase in revenue this year due to increased natural resources taxes and redistribution.
The funds will allow the municipality to use not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to Mažejka, the practice of mandatory marking is widespread in almost all EU countries, which makes it possible to protect the animals themselves (because lost animals can be easily returned to their owners), and saves the time of the animal breeders themselves, when much time and money have to be spent in searching for the escaped and lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation requires that only marked pets are allowed to travel.
At the same time, the marking imposes a lifelong responsibility to care for the animal.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling have faced resistance as the programmes in question were proposed to be funded by the public.
"The model proposed now should avoid this criticism, as it proposes to fund animal protection through increased revenues in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also the public, i.e. the staff of animal welfare institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy", say the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
Thirteen members of the government forces were killed in a Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan.
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were injured in the attack on the joint army and police checkpoint in the district of Choghani.
Nouri said six Taliban fighters were killed and 10 others were wounded in three hours of fighting with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid released a statement to the media claiming responsibility for the attack on Monday in Gazni Province.
Noori said the post was set up two days ago in a strategically important area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The outpost was completely destroyed in the attack.
Rytas extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be played at the Vilnius "Ryto" arena, where the clubs of Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The debate will be held in the capital for political reasons.
The Vilnius Ryt, which has a warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host the teams of Cherkasy Cherkasy Mavpy and Prishtina KB Prishtina under its roof in the Ryta Arena on November 7.
"We were unable to host this match at home because of the political situation between Kosovo and Ukraine, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius have agreed to host us", said Maxim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team, to Ryt.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well with each other.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We're hoping to get support from the Winni.
The Kosovo team could not come to Ukraine because these countries have no diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is third after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more wins.
This will be a crucial stage in the Group E as only two teams will advance to the next round.
In the past, Vilnius hosted the national team matches of Ukraine and Kosovo in the qualifying tournament for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated the 100:61 victory.
Basketball fans will be able to enter the game for free on Wednesday, and the duel will begin at 7 p.m.
"Mothers Lie Better" star actress B. Arsobait is haunted by liars
It is probably a coincidence that the beautiful brunette actress Brigita Arsobaite has been cast in roles involving lies on several occasions.
First, the series "Women Tell Better Lies", then the play "Liars", and finally the comedy "Liars".
In the film, Brigita plays the wife of the hero of the film, Dainius Kazlausko.
"I enjoyed the movie 'The Lie' because I'm more of a theater actress and rarely went to the movies.
The team of amazing colleagues that we assembled promised a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened in the square was the puppy Sunny!
All my life, I thought if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I never really liked those little decorative "fifi" quadruplets.
But during the filming Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even wanted to buy it from the hostess but failed", the actress smiles.
The comic and intriguing quarrels of family members are already being infiltrated from the first minutes by the new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai", produced by the producer of the Lithuanian film hits "Nepatyręs" and "Among Us, Boys"... Paulius Virbickas and the producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionov.
Your lover has just informed me - she is expecting.
That would be great news, except... your lover is your brother's wife!
But there's more.
After not having had time to tell everyone the "good news", the parents suddenly admit that they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this is just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the ending is even more surprising, because nobody expected such a brain.
All heroes are not what they seem at first sight...
In addition to B. Arsabaita, the audience was also treated to a good mood in the comedy "Melagais" by four cinema stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedredė Giedraitytė, Liubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy "Liars" is in theaters November 9th.
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes from emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday agreed to consider the amendment to the Residential Declaration Law prepared by the "village" leader Ramūno Karbauski.
The Seimas was composed of 56 members, 9 against and 25 abstentions.
The Seimas will then begin its consideration of the amendments on or after 6 December, having received the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
The MEP said that in three years, one person does not pay around €1,000 and now there are around 100,000.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that the Seimas would thus "teach some people to go against their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative member of the Health Committee Antanas Matulas noted that Lithuanians living abroad take advantage of the fact that they pay a small fee for health insurance to come to Lithuania for treatment - they are given the same services as residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that persons who pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered as having left Lithuania, and that they will be exempted from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania by the "Sodra".
The head of Sodra, Mindaugas Sinkevičius, has previously said that this step will make life easier for people who have emigrated and for the activities of Sodra.
A viral video of a bear stalking reveals a serious problem
The mother bear, with her hair all dappled, climbs a steep snow slope, and the cub climbs, slides down, and again, with a stubborn cough.
The video received a lot of views and comments.
People admired the little bear's tenacity - he would climb back up to his mother after sliding down.
He succeeds, not at first, but the little one never gives up and finally reaches his goal.
The video is certainly compelling, but it also reveals the threat humans pose to the animals.
Scientists say that it is also important to talk about the fact that the human desire to explore the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"Obviously, the bear drone was very frightening to me.
Their movements indicate that they are panicking.
If the drones were not flying around, they would probably have taken a safer route or would have been slower or more careful.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used", said ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
As the drone approached, some bears would run, others would not, but their hearts would beat faster and faster.
Scientists advise that drone filming be done responsibly, not too close, not too noisy, and not in areas where it is not allowed.
You've been talking to the fugitive president through the newspaper.
A court in Kiev on Tuesday invited the ousted president, Viktor Yanukovych, to Russia to attend a trial on his alleged treason in an unusual way, the summons was published in the state's official gazette.
In a summons published in the government news paper Uriadovoj Kurir, the former leader is summoned to appear at a criminal hearing on November 19 where he could be heard in his closing arguments.
The document indicates that Mr Yanukovych is entitled to participate in the meeting by video link.
On October 30th, the court in Kiev declared the end of the debate in the case of V. Yanukovych.
Mr Yanukovych's lawyer in Russia, Alexander Goroshynsky, was given until 19 November to register with the foreign lawyers' register in order to attend the hearing where Mr Yanukovych is expected to make his final remarks via video link.
He was a supporter of the Russian Federation's decision to impose sanctions on the country.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, and later, war broke out in the east between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, the fighting has claimed some 10,000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
Valdas Benkunskas to the Vilnius City Council with the list of conservatives
The Conservatives had previously endorsed former economy minister, MP Dainius Kreivys, as their candidate for the year.
During the Conservative primary elections, party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, the leader of the conservative list was V. Benkunskas, the chairman of the meeting of the Vilnius branch of the TS-LKD.
The first ten candidates included members of the Vilnius City Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, chairman of the Young Conservatives League Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will be held on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants to be appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition in the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the decision of the rulers to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition faction of the Seimas, the Union of the Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD), announced that a group of members of the Seimas had applied to the Committee of the Regions to examine the constitutionality of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the ruling authorities.
"The law seeks to challenge the existing waste incineration projects by instructing the government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance from residential areas) on the construction of waste incineration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas before the law comes into force", the statement reads.
'The parliamentarians note that, in view of the way in which the prohibition on the construction of waste management facilities of national importance (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of 'habitable area') is formulated in the law, the conclusion that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy production, since the criterion is formulated in such a way that, taking into account the density and distribution of the population of Lithuania, the construction of such facilities would be practically impossible throughout the country', - added in it.
The complaint alleges that the adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'The CoR has repeatedly stated that acts do not apply to legal acts and effects which occurred before the entry into force of a newly adopted act.
In this case, the government is given the power to apply the law retroactively, according to an undefined criterion.
The introduction of such legislation would violate the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and, consequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law', the appeal states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the projects for the cogeneration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas.
Stopping the projects currently underway would not only cause the state hundreds of millions of euros in financial losses, but also great losses for the Lithuanian population, which would see higher heating costs and increased environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste disposed in landfills.
The motion to the KT was signed by the members of the Seimas TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democratic factions and the senior deputy of the ruling Social Democratic Labour faction Algirdas Butkevičius.
Two weeks ago, the Seimas, with the votes of the ruling party, managed to gather 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the President Dalia Grybauskaite, which envisaged the right of the Government to stop the construction of cogeneration power plants already started, and also established a "quarantine" zone 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law, which were adopted by the Seimas again, will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
The proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the right of the Government to suspend projects already started is not envisaged.
The CC will take up the case in order of priority, at the earliest, in a year.
LeBron James's questionable stats on the Lakers have been released.
LeBron James's start at the Los Angeles Lakers was not what he, the organization, and the basketball fans had hoped for.
The Lakers have started the season with four wins and six losses, and a poor start to the season has helped spark rumors of a possible sacking for coach Luke Walton.
But that was put to rest by Magic Johnson, the president of basketball operations, who said he would not let the coach go, but he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should be turning to himself.
Although the offensive statistics are usually impressive, with 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But it doesn't tell the whole story.
The Lakers are playing better without L. James on the court.
The attacker is not happy with the +/- statistic, which shows how many more points the team scores or concedes when certain players are on the field.
With L. James on the court, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 30 points this season.
With him on the bench, the Eagles were up 19 points over the Warriors.
The Lakers are currently only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few wins could turn the whole thing upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region", said Minister L. Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air and police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, three of which in Lithuania.
The last deployment of Spanish Eurofighter aircraft in Šiauliai was between May and August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that Lithuania and Spain regularly consult each other on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely on the European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Robles Fraga has been Spain's fifth representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, José María Robles Fraga presented his resignation to President Dalia Grybauskaita.
V. Appreciation of the arrest of Mr Aço: I believe in his innocence and the rule of law
"It was the most unexpected thing I could ever have imagined.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are doing the work they are supposed to do.
We each do our own work.
I believe in the law, I believe in my husband, that everything is fair and honest, that no dishonest action should be done by him", V. Ačienė told BNS.
Mr Ača was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday, with the police suspecting that he had taken a large bribe while he was still the director of the Raseiniai Municipality administration, and that in exchange he had been able to grant exceptional conditions to a private company that had signed a contract with the Raseiniai Bus Park, owned by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of directly bribing Ach or of being involved in various financial transactions disguising bribes.
The Council of the Raseiniai District Municipality dismissed R. Ača from the post of head of the administration in the third attempt in April this year after a motion of no confidence.
The former "tvarkietis" became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminos Kirkilis in March this year, and on Monday suspended his membership in the party.
Ačas ran unsuccessfully for mayor several years ago as a representative of the Tavo Raseiniai Election Committee.
Ačienė says that the man did not intend to run for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether he would participate in the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of the Lithuanian Peasant and Green Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she expects further action by the law enforcement, which will determine whether she will be removed from the committee.
"I'm not really making any snap decisions today, I think I'll make one this week.
I see, if there is a need for the charges to be brought, of course, I will make a decision one way or the other.
I may have to stay out of all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, time will put everything in its place", she said.
Radvilie Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, urged the Seimas Chairman Viktor Pranckiečiai and the head of the "country" Ramūna Karbauskis to distance themselves from the statements of the parliamentary group colleague Vida Ačiūna and to remove her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, transferring her to work in another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that further work by V. Ačienko in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission would 'create a well-founded distrust in society and discredit the important work of the parliamentary monitoring committee'.
The sensitive music of Coldplay has also attracted the attention of the famous Lithuanian couples
On a cold Monday night, music and movie lovers gathered for the pre-release screening of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a large number of prominent people from all over the world, including Jonas and Simon Nain, Ignaus Lelys, Martyn Tyla, and many others.
The film tells the story of Coldplay, one of Britain's most popular pop rock bands, and is interspersed with moments from concerts.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross first met the group when they were playing in bars and attracting only a few dozen spectators.
The film includes never-before-seen footage from the backstage of concerts, rehearsals, and free time.
Vocalist/pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman and, a little later, by drummer Will Champion.
The band changed its name to Coldplay and exactly twenty years ago they released their first record, "Safety", which contained three songs.
Of the 500 copies of the record, most were distributed to radio stations, producers and friends, and only 50 copies of "Safety" were sold.
Now Coldplay is a band known, respected and loved around the world, with seven albums that have sold over 100 million copies.
Over two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
The winner of the UEFA Champions League is the winner of the UEFA Cup.
The high-scoring Juventus forward, Vaidas Čepka, was named the best player of the week for his solid performance in the Betsafe-LKL match.
The center made a double double, which helped Juventus to beat Alytus Dzukija basketball team in overtime 86: 77.
In almost 31 minutes of play, V. Čepukaitis collected 13 points (5/6 double-doubles) and recovered 11 balls.
In addition, he has thrown seven touchdowns, intercepted three and made four passes.
These indicators guaranteed 30 useful points.
This season, V. Čepukaitis collects 17.2 points per game and this is the best performance of his career playing in the 11th season of the LKL.
The tall guy is the fourth most valuable player in the league this season.
Along with V. Čepukaič, Martyn Gecević and Kšištof Lavrinović (both - Prien's "Skycop"), Yannick Franke (Pasval's "Milk Stars") and Jerai Grant (Klaipėdas's "Neptune") were among the five most useful players of the week.
In the 88-93 loss against Prien's Skycop, Y. Franke scored 24 points, recovered 10 balls and provoked 8 opponents to defeat, collecting 31 useful points.
True, the team's loss prevented him from becoming the most valuable player of the week.
The defensive line of the five with the legionary of Pashalia's team is made by his opponent of the day - M. Gecevičius representing the team of Prien.
He scored 19 points and returned nine of them.
Such marks would have given the sniper 26 useful points.
In the high-altitude series, another Skycop basketball player can be seen - K. Lavrinovičius scored 15 points (3/4 points, 9/11 points), provoked 7 rivals to throw and collected 23 useful balls.
The top five also included the powerful match in Vilnius played by Klaipeda's "Neptun" striker J. Grant.
The American scored 25 points in 25 minutes, 4 rebounds, 3 steals and 29 assists.
Such a legionary display allowed the pilgrims in the capital to triumph over the local "Morning" 78:66.
Highest Influenza In One of the Big Cities
The incidence of influenza and acute upper respiratory infections (UARIs) has decreased in the past week across the country.
According to the Center for Infectious Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), the combined incidence of Lithuania's influenza and HCV infection was 49.9 cases per 10 000 inhabitants from 29 October to 4 November.
The previous week, the rate was 68.1 cases per 10,000 population.

Have you seen the missing person from the Jonah district?
On October 29, the police in the district of Jonava received a report that relatives have been unable to contact Robert Kaladinski, 48, for some time.
In response to the report, the authorities immediately began a search for the man, checking the surroundings of the Ručiūna village and other areas, but were unable to find him.
Male characteristics: about 5'10", lean build, short blond hair, no beard and no mustache.

Palestinian man stabbed and killed in West Bank
A soldier "prevented the attack by identifying a terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier", according to a report by the Israeli military on the incident at the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron.
"The soldier fired on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
Israeli civilians and IDF personnel were not harmed", the report added.
A military spokesman told AFP that the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
Post-incident video shows that he suffered minor injuries.
A wave of Palestinian attacks of a similar nature began in 2015.
Such attacks have decreased in recent years, but there are fears that they could become more frequent.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot dead after attacking a group of Jewish soldiers with a knife near Hebron.
Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in the European Union (EU) countries, to ease the conditions for foreign imports.
Opening the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Grybauskaitė stressed that in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to "unify efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world" by addressing the root causes of the tensions caused by trade wars, "overproduction and unfair competition".
'The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open investment environment - this is important in negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property", said Grybauskaitė.
According to her, China's opening up is important not only for Europe but also for the country and for the global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that transparency of investments must be 'above the interests of any business group'.
'Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements - these must be the key elements in the new environment of investment relations', emphasised Ms Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be tolerated in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries", she added.
China's import show tries to defuse criticism that it avoids opening up its market and protects only its own companies.
The heads of several dozen countries, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania, are taking part in the exhibition.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Lithuania's exports to China increased by 50% last year, to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials worry that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring undesired political influence, and Beijing's exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is dividing the EU.

The Lion Air disaster has been revealed: the anger of the relatives of the victims
Black box data from the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air plane shows that it suffered a speedometer malfunction on at least four of its last flights, investigators said Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), said a similar incident had occurred on the plane's last four flights, including the fatal one on October 29, when the plane crashed in the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board were killed in the crash.
Many media outlets reported on the problems encountered during the previous flight of the Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the real technical problem was the speed of the plane in the air, in other words, the speed of the plane", said Mr. Tjahjono at a press conference.
"The black box data showed that the same problem occurred on the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta", he added.
"There are many rumors circulating on social media.
We now want to clarify that the black box (was missing) data on four flights, during which there were problems with the air speedometer", the head of the NTSC said.
During a meeting with the families of the deceased, Mr. Tjahjono said that the flight recorder information matched the reports that the plane had a disorderly change in speed and altitude after taking off on its last flight.
Search teams have yet to locate the second black box that records the cockpit conversations.
Lion Air stated that following a technical failure on the Bali-Jakarta flight, it was repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak by Minister of Communications Budi Karyasumadi, who moderated a meeting between family members and officials overseeing the search for the plane and the victims' remains and the investigation into the crash.
But he stood up and shook his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr. Kirana, who had co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnanu in 1999, come forward.
Lion Air was not behaving properly", said the father of a passenger, Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
'I want Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention,' he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion".
After this meeting, Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of the identification process.
Nearly 140 body bags containing human remains were handed over to the police for medical examination.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the airliner, which had been in operation for two months, was allowed to take off after a crash on an October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, including a sudden crash that frightened passengers just after takeoff.
Lion Air said the problem was fixed.
"Is it true that the problem was solved?" asked the son of one of the victims.
- If not, the technicians involved must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they did not claim that the plane was allowed to take off again.
These evil technicians must answer to the law so that the plane crashes in Indonesia do not happen again.
Tjahjono said that the large number of small debris and the fact that the debris was spread over a relatively small area suggested that the ship probably crashed into the water at very high speed.
"The plane was in a state of repair when it crashed into the sea.
It did not explode in the air, and the plane's engines were running in great circles when it touched the water - all the turbine blades are down", explained the official.
The Lion Air crash is the worst air disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died in the Garuda plane crash near Medan.
Rescuers of a debris dump driver: Victim and minor
On Monday evening, on the road from V Cancerit to Plungė, a BMW and a Mercedes-Benz collided in front of Tilvik.
Cars collided head-on, three people reported injured.
A BMW driver, born in 1999, reportedly drove in the opposite direction of the traffic and collided head-on with a Mercedes-Benz driven by a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the rubble by firefighters.
A girl from Mercedes-Benz got her teeth knocked out in a car accident.
All the victims were taken to the hospital.
Presidency: No artificial facilitation needed for referendum
After the Seimas approved the ruling party's proposal to reduce the referendum ballot to the currently more protected section of the Constitution, the president will amend the veto, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially of the articles in its first section, should certainly not be by a minority.
It's not hard to predict that the president would veto", Dalio Grybauskaite's adviser on domestic policy told Radio Izvestia on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the basic elements of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty - and that therefore reducing the number of votes required to amend these articles would, according to Mr Lingė, create a 'negative precedent' and 'reverse an unmanageable risk'.
"The President believes that there is no need for artificial facilitation, but rather that the referendum itself should be prepared, that there should be more dialogue with the people", he asserted.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of amendments to the Referendum Law.
It provides that the decision on the amendments to the Constitution, which are more protected, is taken by a referendum of at least two-fifths of the citizens with the right to vote.
Currently, the first and fourteenth articles of the Constitution can be amended by referendum by more than half of all citizens entitled to vote.
About 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania have the right to vote: half of the 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal was born after the Seimas approved the presidential veto in September on amendments previously adopted by the Seimas, which relaxed the requirements for the number of votes in the amendment of Article 12 of the first section of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The referendum is proposed to be shortened in preparation for a referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 May and 26 May of the following year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Emigrating after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, they are currently, with some exceptions, not allowed to have dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community around the world is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum will not take place - there will not be enough people to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are "broken" and need to be upgraded
Lithuania's airport and road infrastructure is beginning to deteriorate, and it is necessary to renew it, says Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of Vilnius airport is the minimum task that the state must carry out.
'The airport's transport infrastructure is already in a state of disrepair, as it was designed for lower passenger flows.
We have to renovate Vilnius airport - it's not even part of long-term planning, it's the minimum we have to do", Mr Masiulis said at a conference organised by the Democracy Development Fund and the magazine "State" on Tuesday.
The next decade will be crucial, he said, as it will involve major projects such as the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the Klaipėda external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports and the possible construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we need to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the outer port in Klaipėda, to repair the airports, perhaps to decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, start now on projects that will use our potential 10, 20 or 30 years from now", said the Minister of Communications.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that too little money had been spent on road maintenance in recent years.
"The roads are not getting better because of the lack of funding.
We are able to build new roads, but even the most basic maintenance, such as on the highways, is lacking in funds.
We have to set a budget for road maintenance if we want to improve the condition of roads", said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuania's exports of transport services increased by 18,6% this year, with Germany becoming the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal to require EU carriers to return trailers to their country of registration on a regular basis.
'We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
In my opinion, the proposal to return to the home country permanently is absurd, because Europe would be driving empty trucks, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
Railways will benefit most from this, because the cost will increase to the point where some of the transport will be transferred to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions", said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12,2%.
The Lithuanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
It employs over 118,000 people and has over 7,500 businesses.
The Dispute with the Heirs
Last week, Mr Masiulis told the Seimas Economic Committee that he had started negotiations on the cultural redevelopment of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), Algimantas Degutis, called the deliberations of Mr. Masiulio political pressure.
He said the building, built in the 1960s, was a treasure, registered in 1993, and it was not politicians but professionals who should decide whether to demolish it.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"It would be a politically important step to take that old terminal out of the heritage, to be able to demolish it and build a new modern arrivals terminal, so that when you arrive in Vilnius you feel in a modern country, not in an interesting one that doesn't really represent our country as innovative", Mr Masiulis said last week in the Seimas.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement with Ryanair was signed on 1 January 2009 and entered into force on 1 January 2010.
This transport hub should be operational in 2026, after the completion of the Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to serve 4.8 million passengers, and next year - 5 million.
The total number of passengers served by Kaunas airport last year was 1,2 million.
What are Lithuanian soldiers doing in Afghanistan?
The NRA shall report on the tasks they perform.
In total, nearly 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
The cabal.
The headquarters of Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital is staffed by logistics element soldiers who serve all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organize visits and rotation of troops.
The Headquarters also houses two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, who ensure the interaction of the NATO Mission Command and Combat Support with the 'spectacles' in Kandahar.
The NATO mission Headquarters, Stronghold, is staffed by military police officers who maintain public order.
The same headquarters is occupied by the Lithuanian staff.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
This is Kandahar.
About 30 Lithuanian special operations forces are serving in Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan.
They trained a local police special operations unit, which has about 150 Afghans.
Official SOP troops train in their own training areas or outside of them.
The term "aircraft" is also used by the Air Force to describe unmanned aircraft.
The herat.
The headquarters of the GNA is located in this city in northwestern Afghanistan.
They work in the boards responsible for military training, logistics, intelligence, operations and planning.
Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius
The largest regular passenger plane, the Boeing 767, will land at Vilnius airport next spring, and will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bė, which belongs to Madagascar, according to the portal madeinvilnius.lt, which relies on information from the tour operator Itaka Lietuva.
It is announced that Blue Panorama passengers will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new holiday destination will be accessible directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominik Milowskis, the general director of Itaka Lietuva, says that Lithuania is trying to offer tourists new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island nation in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
The new holiday travel itineraries for the 2019 summer season have been developed by other tour operators.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement between the airlines and the airlines was signed on 29 June 2013 and was signed on 30 June 2013.
Minister of Finance on the possible crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We must always be prepared for the worst.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease", said V. Šapoka during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Migli Tuskienė attends meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or are about to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed that, pending global agreement, there should be an agreement on how revenues from the provision of certain digital services should be taxed in the EU Member States.
The Eurogroup will examine the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget of Italy as not complying with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has used this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss the issues of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing a European deposit insurance system and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but believes that the functions of the ESM should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently, the 120th anniversary of the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural metaphysician, ethnographer and historian Balio Buračo (1897-1972) was celebrated in Sidariu, Šiauliai valley, in the then Šiauliai Governorate.
As we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the vibrant national revival has called many Lithuanians, including brothers Burači - Bali, Jón, Broni - from the very depths of the countryside, all of us creatives can be involved in the cultivation, embedding and preservation of our cultural traditions.
For more than 50 years, the photographer has travelled through his native country, and has presented a broad and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk arts and material culture of our country.
He was concerned with preserving the rapidly disappearing relics of a national culture and had a rare ability to appreciate the lasting value of his work.
Balio Burach's photographs of Lithuanian landscapes, hills, everyday life and celebrations have captured the lives of our people in national costumes, and have graced the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication contains a considerable amount of material on the heritage of Bali Buraco, on the folk work customs and related traditions, and, most importantly, on their attractive iconography.
The material presented not only shows the uniqueness and beauty of those traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and a heavy occupation.
The manuscript of the book is very rich in written descriptions of the activities of the people of the interwar Zemaitiya, especially the Kupiskėė people, the Šiauliė people, the Telšiks, as well as the Aukštaitiya and Dzūkija people, their festivals and other traditions and customs of Bali Burač.
From some 10,000 surviving negatives in museums and archives, this edition has selected over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs, grouped by selected texts.
They reflect unique aspects of ethnic culture, typical of the Kupe, Dzuki, other regions of the Upper and Lower Caucasus.
A suspect in a hit-and-run in Panevėžys has been on the loose for four hours.
How a young man (born 1994) managed to escape from the police car has not been disclosed by the authorities.
He was brought in on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., the police posted a picture of the driver and appealed to the public for help: "A white man, Dalius Malakauskas (born in 1994), suspected of stealing a service car, escaped.
The man ran off with the gloves.
If you see this person, please contact 112 or 8700 60000.
It's filled.
It's five minutes and thirty-five.
The police department reported: "The suspect was arrested in Panevėžys, facing another case for attempted escape.
Thank you all for your help.
Tragic fate of the couple: Died within hours of marriage
A newlywed couple who had been married for just a few hours were killed in a helicopter crash in southwest Texas, U.S.A.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife of the same age, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed shortly after midnight Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a hill 10 miles northwest of Southwest and 80 miles west of San Antonio, said local justice of the peace Steven Kennedy.
The strange thing is that the accident occurred at a distance of about 15 miles [24 km], the exact age of the newlyweds.
The helicopter pilot, 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence, was also killed.
The newlyweds were students at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married on a Saturday night at the Byer family ranch near Juval, and after the wedding party, they took off in the family's helicopter.
The accident occurred after the helicopter had flown about 15 miles [24 km].
The newlyweds flew to San Antonio International Airport where they planned to board a plane and fly for their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"This is a very rocky, uneven terrain area, and the hill is about 400 to 500 feet [120 to 150 meters] high", said Kennedy.
Mr. D. Lawrence has been flying the family's planes for many years.
According to S. Kennedy, he was a helicopter pilot and served in Vietnam.
An autopsy should reveal the pilot's physical condition and whether it could have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed approximately 5 to 10 minutes after take-off.
Its wreckage was exposed by a wide beam on a rocky hillside, leaving the body "dangerously bent", flight safety investigator Craig Hatch of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a news conference Monday.
Investigators are going to remove the wreckage and then take a good look at it, but it's not going to be easy for the tow truck and the truck to get to the site, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined, and the preliminary report of the NTSB is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli PM calls new sanctions against Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day", Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day when under President Trump the United States is imposing extremely tough sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran in the entire period since the beginning of the effort to curb its aggression", the Israeli prime minister said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would be a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest sanctions of all time", follow Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from the world powers' deal with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about a million barrels a day since May, and to cut off Tehran's access to international financing.
Israel has long opposed the deal with Iran, saying its scope and timing were too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to fund militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed to prevent it from establishing a military presence there.
The other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the U.S. decision and say that the deal, as intended, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court is re-examining the circumstances surrounding the death of a young motorcyclist.
In the case of the accident that ended in the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius District Court decided on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case would be interviewed at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
A guilty verdict has already been handed down in this case, but the prosecution disagrees.
On 22 January, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, of speeding and gross misconduct in the city.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office asks the District Court to annul the judgment of the District Court, arguing that E. Osipov is the main culprit of the accident and that the conclusions of the District Court are unfounded.
The lawyer for the dead motorcyclist's family is also asking for the verdict to be overturned.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015 at about 15:00 when the Škoda Fabia car driven by E. Osipov entered Žirmūnas Street from Lakūnas Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecution accused the man of violating the rules of the road by giving way to a motor vehicle, causing an accident that killed a man on the main road on a Piaggio motorcycle.
Initial police reports said the driver of the scooter was killed, but subsequent investigations have found that the vehicle is comparable in power to a motorcycle.
Judge Rolandas Bužinskas of the Vilnius District Court told BNS that the experts found that the motorcyclist was travelling at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, despite the speed limit of 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would travel at such a high speed", said the judge.
At the time, the elderly driver claimed to be driving at only five or six miles an hour.
The driver of the motorcycle, seeing the obstacle, tried to brake and fell from the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecution believes that E. Osipov, who drove from the side road to the main road, was supposed to give way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six of the Wagner mercenaries were killed in Syria
The death toll includes five members of the Syrian Armed Forces and six members of the Wagner military company.
This is according to a source in Syria for Novaya Gazeta.
The source said that one of the Syrian Fifth Army Corps units, which is joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and 'mercenaries', is deployed in the area.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry for information on the fate of the Russians.
Former Belgian king to take paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking to be recognised as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, the Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had an unconsummated love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies any parentage.
According to the station's RTBF, he could appeal to the Supreme Court to oppose the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the ex-husband of Delphine's mother, is not the artist's biological or legal father.
Delphine applied for a proper examination to be recognised as the daughter of Albert's "real" father.
The CCP will give money to the parties but nothing to the social workers
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is set to distribute nearly 3 million euros in budgetary aid to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), founded this spring and led by Parliament's Deputy Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilos, has yet to receive any budgetary allocation.
However, they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the CWC, if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, the WCC chair, informed the VG that 'this Thursday there is a meeting of the commission where it is planned to decide on the allocation of the budgetary half-yearly grant to the lots'.
She said the CoR had to decide on the matter by 15 November.
EUR 2,751 million is to be distributed to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary parties.
The opposition Union of Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats is expected to receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of Peasants and Greens about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democrats about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Alliance about EUR 0.4 million, Labour, which does not have its own faction in the Seimas, about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined Order and Justice Party, which does not represent the ruling party, and the opposition party, the non-election party of the Lithuanian People's Party-Conservative Alliance, about EUR 0.18 million.
According to the current law, which the LAC will follow, when allocating budget money, grants are allocated to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the vote in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
The current legal framework therefore does not allow the LSDDP, which was only established in the spring of this year, to expect to receive money from the budget.
But this party has never participated in any elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The amendments to the law on political parties and the budget for this year, which were passed by the Seimas, were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the representatives of the ruling party, Mr. Kirkilas and the leader of the peasant-green party, Ramunas Karbauskis, argue that the parliamentarians will try to reject the objections of the president.
However, this will not be possible before the next WTO meeting on Thursday, and therefore, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, 'the grants will be distributed according to the legal order which has existed until now'.
However, the head of the CPC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this week or next week and new amendments to the budget allocation to parties come into force, the committee may consider a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the whole legal environment as we are the executive body that has to implement the laws we adopt", she said.
If the Seimas were to override the veto and the new laws were to come into force, the Government would allocate additional money to the parties, borrowing the corresponding amounts in addition.
The grants already awarded to seven lots would not be affected by such a decision.
The results of Šiaulių bankas were used to sell the shares

Poroshenko: Those who ordered the murder of Handziuk must be punished
"I want to make it clear that no version - and there are more than 20 versions today - will be rejected.
Each one will be examined very carefully in accordance with the investigative procedures.
As president, I have no right or obligation to obtain information that could jeopardize the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement agencies must be efficient.
This is the only way to find out the truth and punish the wrongdoer", Poroshenko said at a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the murder of Mr Handziuk being investigated and that the murderers, the organisers and the perpetrators of the crime "should be held accountable".
"After this case was requalified as a murder (case), they are fully justified and justifiably facing life imprisonment", the Ukrainian president said.
He justified the public demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case.
The Commission also adopted a communication on the implementation of the EU's new law on the protection of personal data and on the protection of personal data in the event of an infringement of the fundamental rights of the EU.
He also said that political speculation on the issue would not help clarify the situation and would only confuse things further.
"I call on all forces, both the government and the opposition, not to waste time on unfounded arguments and, for God's sake, not to use this assassination for public relations", the president said.
- On the contrary, we must now come together to ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, and fast, so as to inspire public trust.
There is no other way".
"No one will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the country", he assured.
In July, anti-corruption activist K. Handziuk was attacked and acid-bombed in Kherson city.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka tendered his resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, public activists accused the authorities of failing to properly conduct the investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of the Interior.
"Today I am presenting my resignation", Lucenka told parliamentarians as he read out his investigation report.
Parliament has yet to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify the perpetrators of the murder of Handziuk.
Bill Gates introduced the waterless toilet
In his introduction of the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates likened the change from traditional toilet facilities to waterless ones to the 1980s computer revolution.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn't need running water in pipes at an exhibition in Beijing, Reuters reports.
The waterless toilet works on the principle of separating solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technologies you see here are the greatest advances in sanitation in the last 200 years", Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was developed with funds from a charitable foundation established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
In seven years, the foundation spent $200 million to develop a device that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water.
In all, Bill Gates says, there were about 20 different models of the toilet.
The facility is now complete and available for sale.
But to make these toilets mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend another $200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, poor sanitation causes the death of 500,000 children under the age of five every year.
To combat poor sanitation, such as cholera and other diseases, the world's health-care budget is increasing, reaching $233 billion.
To illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates has introduced a toilet with a glass of feces.
This, he says, is a good reminder that a small sample "may contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 eggs of worm parasites".
Mr S. Slyva has been elected President of the Football Association of Masia
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Mass Football Association took place in Kaunas, where Sergejus Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the Association was convened following the request of Anatoli Stechenko to resign from the position of President of the Association.
13 of the 15 members participated.
The main item on the agenda was the election of a new president.
Two candidates took part in the elections - Sergey Slyva and Vadot Rasten.
11 members of the association voted for S. Slya, two members voted for V. Rasten.
S.Slyva will complete the term of office started by A. Stecenko, which will last until January 2021.
France: Deaths are a cause for concern
French health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on the widely used pesticide, amid concerns over decades of recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide metam was taken after a new safety inspection launched earlier this year, before at least three waves of poisoning began in September in the department of Maine and the Loire.
The government had already suspended the use of pesticides because of these cases.
This soil disinfectant should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
The product must be used in large quantities to be effective.
In France, about 700 tons were used each year.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anzhe region, where lettuce is grown in large numbers, complained of eye and throat swelling, and breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they do not precipitate it", said the deputy director of the ANSES, Francoise Weber (Fransuaza Veber), to the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
Methane, one of the most widely used pesticides in the United States and Europe, is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The pesticide, sold under the names 'Vapam' and 'Sectagon', is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety inspection is due to be carried out.
"There was no other choice but to take it out of the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives", Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will be faced by the lettuce growers, the farmers in general, but the public health is more important", she said.
Farmers have already expressed displeasure with the government's decision last month to stop the use of metam in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tons of lettuce eaten annually in Europe.
The next season will see "far fewer lettuce sultanas, radishes and pears" after the government suspended the use of metam last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the federation of farmers in Nanto, told AFP.
EUR 70 million invested in shopping centre with observation wheel in Tallinn
The opening of a new shopping centre 'T1' in the Estonian capital next weekend, in which the local capital real estate development company 'Pro Kapital Grupp' has invested EUR 70 million.
The development will include 150 shops, services and entertainment venues, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, and a total of 130,000 square metres of retail space, or 55,000 square metres of leasable space, according to the developer's announcement.
By comparison, the total area of Vilnius 'Acropolis' (including office space) is about 110,000 sq. m.
'T1' is the first shopping centre to have a rooftop observation wheel, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition, the international transport gate will be integrated into the area: trams will be running alongside, and intercity buses will soon be running alongside.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also located nearby, and is expected to serve 1 million passengers per year by around 2026.
Paul Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the world of shopping centres is undergoing a fundamental transformation and that T1 has been at the forefront of this development.
"We have created a new generation of shopping centre that provides an experience and an emotion that is not available on the Internet.
It is a place of attraction in the heart of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthwhile object to visit and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family", said Mr Michelozzi, quoted in the press release.
A Focus on Pleasure
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
The total area of the property is 12000 m2, or one fifth of the total lettable area.
The distinctive feature is the roof-mounted observation wheel.
It will raise the visitor to a height of 120 m above sea level - higher than that of the TV tower in Tallinn.
The company claims that the Super Skypark, the largest skate centre in Europe and the first basketball and skateboarding arena in Estonia, will be located on the fourth floor of the observation deck.
The interactive SkyLAB Exploration and Discovery Centre promises to keep children occupied for at least five to six hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree 4D panorama of China.
In addition to the regular cinema, which is shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
The visual effects and the seating that move to the rhythm of the film are enhanced by the effects of wind, rain, and snow, as well as by the smells, smoke, and smoke in the theater.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenues by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange and also on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group had sales revenue of EUR 1,8 million in Lithuania and a loss of EUR 350 000 according to Pro Kapital Grupp's financial report.
In 2016, the Lithuanian market generated sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and net profit of EUR 2,4 million.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon: President Paul Biya sworn in for seventh term after controversial elections
In a ceremony overseen by Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the 85-year-old Biya vowed to protect the "integrity and unity" of the West African country.
Africa's oldest president, in power for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the elections were marred by low voter turnout, violence and alleged fraud.
On the eve of Mr P's inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff, including the headmaster, were abducted from a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where armed separatists are campaigning for independence.
Most of Cameroon's 22 million people are French-speaking, while one-fifth are Anglophone.
In 2016, demands for autonomy were raised in the North West and neighbouring South West Province, following complaints of alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy.
In 2017, after Biya refused to compromise, the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Ambazonia", and took up arms.
According to nongovernmental organizations, separatist attacks and counter-operations have killed at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some by crossing the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live in semi-starved forests.
In the October elections, only 5% of voters in the North West region voted, compared to 15% of the electorate in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary: Mistakes caused by inexperience
"There was a lack of space - you understand that the party had its resources to organize everything.
Some municipalities have allowed us to use their facilities, but not all have voting booths because we cannot afford them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent", said the politician.
According to him, the complaints were received, but their content did not change and the infringements themselves were not malicious.
"There were trials.
Not all the people who voted were experienced - they were new to it too.
So, not all of our actions were consistent with our order.
Therefore, the CRC had to warn that the principles we described should be respected.
These complaints are not enough to call into question the results,' said Mr Anušauskas.
According to the Chairman of the CCC, there were cases where ballot papers were not stamped - upon finding out about this, ballot papers found without a stamp were cancelled.
Some campuses are short of space, but according to A. Anushauskas, complaints and violations are related to a few dozen bulletins.
"Well, since the difference is several thousand, it's not really a significant difference to the election results", explained Anušauskas.
It is reported that the participation rate of the party members in the elections was 55%, while the participation rate of the non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people working on the committees.
The results of Sunday's election were also unchanged, with 79% of voters voting for the winner Ingrid Šimonytė (16,418 votes), while Vygaud Ušackė received 21% (4,441 votes).
On 17 November, the Council of the TS-LKD will officially support the candidacy of I. Šimonytė in the presidential elections to be held in May next year.
Trump says he's not likely to meet with Putin in Paris.
White House national security adviser John Bolton earlier said Trump would meet Putin in Paris, where commemorations of the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I are being held this week.
But as he headed to the final rally before the midterm congressional elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if this was the right time to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure I'll see you in Paris.
Probably not", said the U.S. president.
However, the White House official added that the two would meet during the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" afterwards.
Trump continues to try to "reset" relations with Moscow despite allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstutis Strupas requests that the decision of the VTEK be annulled
Kęstutis Strupas, former director general of the Santaros Clinics at the University of Vilnius, asks to revoke the decision of the Supreme Ethics Commission (VTEK) - which recognized that not to declare transactions in time was a violation of the law.
On Tuesday, Mr Strup's complaint was examined by the Vilnius County Administrative Court.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requests the annulment of the decision of the ECtHR of 23 May, as reported by the court representative, Ms Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė, to BNS.
Mr. Strupas believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, as he understands the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then-removed Director General of Santara Clinics, K. Strupas, and the Head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation revealed that four transactions were reported without the deadlines: a loan taken from the bank by the spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift of an apartment to the daughter in 2017 and a loan granted to a natural person jointly with the spouse in 1996 and not repaid.
Ms Strupien also declared these transactions in default.
Persons who have violated the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be promoted for a year.
The law requires that you declare not only your personal data but also your spouse's data.
The investigation was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information obtained from Info TV.
The question whether Mr Strup and his wife, Ms S. Strupienė, head of the outpatient rehabilitation department at Vilnius University Hospital, duly and in a timely manner declared their transactions.
As reported by Info TV, last year K. Strup left his daughter a property worth 125,000 euros.
However, the former director of the clinics of the Santaros mentioned above and his wife did not indicate their interests in the declarations.
The prosecution has accused Mr Strup and at least ten other people of corruption in the investigation, alleging that the law enforcement agencies demanded illegal financial compensation from companies for the public computers and software purchased from clinics, disguised as support.
Thus, Mr Strup is suspected of having been involved in at least five infringements during the Santares Clinics public procurement in the field of information technology.
K. Strupas himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his post as head of the Santara clinic in September.
The decision of the shareholders of the Santaras Clinic, the Ministry of Health and Vilnius University to terminate the employment relationship with Mr. Strupus at his own request.
He was in charge of the hospital from 10 November 2013.
The new Director General will be appointed by the General Council on the basis of a call for tenders.
President of the Republic of Moldova on the occasion of the G7 Summit
According to the President, Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors into a whole of art, eternal values, and opens up the wisdom and memory of a thousand-year-old nation.
The author's work is loved and appreciated - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testify to L. Gutauskas being a multi-talented artist.
Congratulating the artist on the occasion of his jubilee, the President thanked him for his significant works, which enriched Lithuania, and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
They want to change the way schools teach. They want less testing, more practice.
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in the content of education, which were announced at the Forum "Change in the content of education: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania" in Vilnius on Monday.
Speaking at the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over 30 million euros had been invested in updating educational content over the past ten years, but without any results.
"According to the international student achievement survey PISA, pupils' achievement is below the OECD average", said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
OECD expert Philas Lambert, quoted in the Ministry of Education and Science report, argued that Lithuania was too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on its practical application.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programmes focus on literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but also on children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy and empathy.
The Vice-Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting the changes in the general education content, said that the number of updated programs starting this academic year will be reduced, they will be more specific, the disciplines will be more closely linked.
According to the Deputy Minister, pupil education will be more individualized, schools will be more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare from 10 to 30 per cent of their own unique educational content, the current pupil evaluation system will be transformed into a cumulative score, more weight will be given to learning and informally acquired pupil competence.
Reduce the number of standardised tests.
The promise is that the common training programmes will be digital, user-friendly, linked to electronic resources, task bank.
The aim of the renewal of the curriculum is to improve pupil achievement in the international PISA test by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupil achievement by one third, to improve the modern competencies acquired in school, and to improve the literacy in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7.8 million from the European Union and the state budget to renew the educational content from May 2018.
The project of updated general education programmes for the 2019-2020 school year is expected to be piloted in a part of the schools and to be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
In early October, the Ministry was criticised for a project worth almost €8 million, carried out by the Centre for the Development of Education, to update the common programmes for primary, primary and secondary education.
The first call for tender for the creation of training programmes was announced at the beginning of October.
The purchase was suspended after experts criticized it, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the director of the Centre for Educational Development, Giedrius Vaidelė.
Exercise in Lithuania on how to respond to extreme flooding
Lithuania will begin a 10-day exercise on Monday to improve the response of its institutions to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (FDR), the exercise will test the readiness of state authorities to respond to a national emergency, such as a flood, by: managing the consequences, coordinating the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from the affected areas, organizing their supply of drinking water, food, ensuring the necessary energy supply and providing other means of protection for the population.
The exercise will be attended by more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions, as well as members of the emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities.
The preparation phase of the exercise will take place from 5 to 13 November, during which municipalities, having received information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PAGD on the continuous rainfall and the flooding, will make decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14th and 15th.
During its term, the department will have a State Emergency Operations Centre and the State and Municipal institutions will have institutional emergency operations centres.
Following the government's declaration of a state-level emergency in relation to the flood, the Prime Minister's Chief of Operations will lead the emergency response, its consequences, and the protection and rescue of people and property.
Deputy Director of the PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that the main focus of the exercise is to check the readiness of the authorities to perform the functions provided for by the legislation, to assess the possibility of exchanging information, to check how prepared to warn and inform the population, state and municipal institutions, institutions and enterprises about the impending disaster and to "improve the skills of the state authorities in managing emergency situations".
The exercise will also demonstrate the combined capabilities of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump huge amounts of water from the affected areas.
The 'BaltFloodCombat' module was set up for this purpose in 2009.
Resignation of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lucenka
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation Tuesday in a speech to the country's parliament following the death of the acid-drenched anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandzuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
Former Deputy Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of the so-called 'Lugansk People's Republic'.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the murder of K. Gandzuk to the Verkhovna Rada.
In his speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being used for political PR.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who publicly spoke out against police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Kherson.
On 31 July, an unknown assailant, K. Gandzuk, sprayed her face with acid in front of her house.
She died in hospital on 4 November as a result of her injuries.
Protesters demand an answer from the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior about who killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix.
According to J. Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 people who may be connected to the ordering of the murder of K. Gandziuk.
But one of the most credible versions of the study was leaked to the media, and that threatens the success of the study.
The Attorney General says that the leaked information has given the suspects access to vital information.
Lucenko added that he knew Gandzuk personally and was upset that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one can say that someone is holding power, I want to announce that I am submitting my resignation.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss it in the Parliament,'" the Obozrevatel quotes Lucenko as saying in the Rada.
Lucenko is reported to have added that "the country cannot tolerate a dual system of government, with the system of law enforcement being broken without any evidence, even for the crimes that have been exposed".
He is a member of the 'People's Council' of the so-called 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
He was appointed as Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, who was suspected of covering up corruption of high-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy J. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As the Advisor to the Minister of Energy, Aurelija Vernickaitė, informed Elta, the meeting will focus on the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector before 2020 and beyond 2020.
The European Commission (EC) estimates that transport is the only sector not currently pursuing the trajectories set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a renewable energy share of 6% in 2015.
The Commission considers that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is relatively slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high greenhouse gas emissions reduction costs and unclear regulation.
The renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a minor role in this phase.
The Seimas took up the issue of the proposed corruption investigation to supplement the Conservatives' appeals to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday approved the proposal, which was registered by the "state" leader Agneja Širinskienė for the investigation of unlawful influence on political processes.
There were 58 Seimas members, against 27, nine deputies abstained.
The bill will then be considered by the Seimas committees, the main appointed committee on Law and Order, headed by A. Širinskienė.
After receiving its opinion, the vote on the adoption of the amendments to the resolution will be taken.
The current interim Sejm commission of inquiry into political corruption is investigating possible illicit influence from 2008 to 2016.
The Commission also requested the Polish authorities to provide additional information on the alleged illegal use of the 'Third Party's' flag in the context of the 'Third Party's' activities.
A. Širinskienė refers to the project as 'the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or in the appeal to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such important independent bodies as the Central Commission for Professional Ethics'.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "country" found that the Conservatives based their appeal largely on arguments from the lawyers of the private pension funds.
The leaders of the "country" have accused former comrade Pavel Urbschi before the Supreme Commission for Ethics in the Workplace (VTEK).
According to them, the former Chairman of the State Administration and Municipalities Committee of the Seimas could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former Head of the Prevention Department of the Commission, Mindaugas Siauri.
At the end of September, the Sejm set up a committee to investigate possible unlawful influence by interested persons or groups of them on the conduct of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, the functioning and financing of parties and public movements, the legislative process, the election and appointment of members of publicly owned companies, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to examine what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities and how it has been responded to.
The investigators should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
In the meantime, the campaign for the presidential elections and the European Parliament will take place.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are 'local' representatives.
Two social workers, one "orderly" liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Election Action-Christian Family Union were also appointed as its members.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to take part in the committee's work.
The new investigation was initiated by the chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union, Ramūnas Karbauskis.
He said that the investigation carried out by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) last session had shown that the investigation needed to be continued, essentially because of the same issues.
The head of Germany's domestic intelligence has lost his post.
The 55-year-old added to the controversy by claiming that the "radical left" in Merkel's coalition was to blame for his troubles.
As a result, instead of being transferred to another post as promised earlier, he was forced to go into reserve.
In addition, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European intelligence agencies held in Warsaw a few weeks ago, H.G. Maassen criticized the "naive" immigration policy of A. Merkel.
Germany's interior minister, Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the intelligence chief, told a news conference on Monday that Maassen's latest comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointing".
Seehofer, who had been under pressure both because of the dispute and because of his party's poor showing in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen into custody.
A spate of shark attacks has terrorized the island - the third person to be accused
The Queensland Ambulance Service reports that a victim of an attack near the Sydney Harbour on the Queensland coast suffered "slip and wrist injuries".
The man was taken by helicopter to the hospital.
The island of Sakmini is the largest of the archipelago of the same name, attracting many diving and sailing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks have been relatively rare in this region until now.
On September 19, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbour, and the next day a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack before the last of the late-stage attacks occurred in this hall in 2010.
The WCC has two new members - Visconti and Puck

A young woman in a dressed-up state breaks down stereotypes about wedding dresses
The fat girl in the white bridal gown - mission (not) possible?
Can the white floating shrine be larger than an S or an M and still look attractive?
The plus-size reality show "The Evolution of the Body" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of a bride is not really dependent on the weight of a woman.
But that's not all - one of the girls in the project was moved to tears tonight by the fact that her boyfriend is on the set.
"There are those who think that bigger girls don't get attention or looks from guys.
It's a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me as I am, he doesn't require me to fit into any standard figure", Aurika, the contestant in the wedding dress, said before the show.
A wedding dress is not light in any sense, clothing is a complex construction, it contains a lot of material, the dress is heavy, it's not easy to move.
Also, some women feel that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less confident.
I can assure you that a well-chosen dress model will definitely solve this 'problem.'"
The girls' fate is decided by Kalinkinas and the entire committee - plus-size fashion house owner Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagli Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"There is a lot of friction between the panelists when deciding which girl should leave the show - we all come from different backgrounds and have different ideas of who should win the show.
And what made the wedding dress demonstration even more difficult was that, as I can reveal now, there were two newcomers who were certainly not worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every way", says Kalinkin.
The newcomers - Eve, who became famous for her scandalous behavior at the age of 23 in a summer reality show, and Dovilė, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - participated in the selection of "Dance (r) evolution" like other girls and entered the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open girls' photo session in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were brought back to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for their favorites on the TV portal.
The internationally acclaimed reality show about a beauty queen is in its second week in Lithuania, where plus-size girls compete for the title of the first plus-size star in the country.
So far, there are only eight of them left, and they all know very well that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of the Universe" begins this Monday night at 8:30 p.m. on LNK.
Actor I. Elba voted sexiest man in the world
People magazine has named him the sexiest man in the world this year.
He was 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected, he did not take the joke of the new title.
I thought, "No way!
Really?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, "Yeah, I look sexy today", and the actor laughed.
Speaking frankly, Idriss said that the title was a very pleasant feeling that had flattered his ego.
The British star says that he was often the subject of abuse and name-calling, which made his childhood difficult because, as he puts it, he was "very tall and very cheap".
The young actor was considered unusual and the object of ridicule by his peers both because of his unusual name and his African origin.
"I just grew a mustache and muscles and became the most handsome guy in my neighborhood", Idris smiles.
When her husband is not busy on the big screen, Elba is a disc-dancer at parties in Spain, and especially in the bustling city of Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a fashion collection, which he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says that family is the most important thing in the world to him, and he is planning to marry his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba I. was named the 33rd sexiest man in the world by People magazine.
In 2017, the title was won by Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during drinking party in Širvati district
A man was beaten to death during a drinking party in the village of Šalkiški in Širvintų district on Monday evening.
According to Vilnius County Police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drinking session.
When the doctors arrived, they found the man, born in 1943, dead.
Arrested suspect, born in 1994, found to be 2.53 percent intoxicated.
Police are investigating the incident.
The controllers do not require a 20 km distance for the construction of waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built near the Gariūnas market.
The authorities no longer require that incinerators be located at a distance of 20 kilometres from the settlements.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, the "nationalist" Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in Parliament on Monday, which abolishes such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeik, the "national" faction, which had previously supported the provision on the 20 km distance, pledged to support the amendment on its withdrawal.
The amendment to the Mažejka Act provides that, as from January 2019, waste incineration plants may be constructed in accordance with the requirements of environmental protection and public health protection laid down by law.
He admits that the amendment has led to the president's doubts about the ban.
'Looking at the definition of the residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find a place where the above objects could be built,' says the chairman of the committee.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto of amendments to tighten construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to prohibiting the construction of waste incineration plants closer than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided for the possibility for the government to make decisions on the future of two power plants already under construction, taking into account the interests of public health.
The latter provision is not proposed to be amended by Mr Mažeik.
The energy group "Lithuanian Energy" is building a waste- and biofuel-based power plant in Vilnius, and "Fortum Heat Lietuva" in Kaunas, together with the Finnish energy group "Fortum".
The latter are already incinerating waste in Klaipėda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of Britain and Ireland discussed on Monday a possible compromise on the difficult Northern Ireland issue, which is hampering Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
In a telephone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested a review of the so-called backstop arrangement, which would leave the border between the UK province of Northern Ireland and the EU-member Republic of Ireland open.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but has ruled out any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the course of the conversation, Mr May 'raised the possibility of revising the backstop mechanism', it said.
'The Minister has indicated that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such review does not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the safeguard measures,' the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators have failed to agree on how to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
Both sides agree on a 'safeguard measure' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a wider trade agreement is signed, which should ensure that no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to follow EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied provisionally to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop agreement in three months.
But Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support this".
'Three-month or limited-term guarantees are not worth the paper they will be written on,' he said.
London and Brussels have previously denied reports of a breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following reports in Britain over the weekend that a deal is on the horizon.
'I would say that we are still making progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done,' said Mrs May's spokesman in London.
European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas also told reporters: "We are not there yet".
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of leading thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a statement Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the age of the Internet.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and the Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We urge goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts", the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global information and communications space" is a common good that "must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion".
'People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the truth of the obligation, the principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding,' the declaration added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who is often criticized for "not being the news", but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
The EU is also calling for the UN to be given the power to impose sanctions on the country.
The declaration was drawn up over a period of two months under the leadership of Mr Ebadi and Mr Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based media freedom and journalism advocacy organisation.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao, and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provide that fines for product safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were unanimously adopted in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas Health Committee, said in relation to the new draft, it was welcome that the objectives were related to better consumer protection of products.
It also aligns its provisions with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
'I believe that the proposed draft law will be more precise and more specific in its distribution to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because the entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements,' said Mr Vinkus.
The draft was drawn up by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and, after the Government's approval, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its own proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give more power to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system for product safety requirements and monitoring compliance.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product to ensure its traceability.
The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs have also provided information on the safety of the products and the safety of the products used in the production of the product.
The Ministry's assessment is that the six-month time limit for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to establish an infringement, investigate and impose a fine.
The Ministry also claims that the fines imposed are not effective enough.
Companies are often repeatedly breaking the law - 14 companies in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Agriculture proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product to ensure its traceability, in order to facilitate the identification of suppliers of non-compliant products by the market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to inspect the premises, buildings and facilities of economic operators who produce or supply products to the market for the purpose of carrying out national product safety controls.
The penalty for breaking the law is to be increased.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous products on the market and the distributor who places them on the market, or the service provider who provides or supplies dangerous services, are to be fined between EUR 150 and EUR 2 500 (and between EUR 144 and EUR 1 448).
If the State Consumer Protection Authority (VVTAT) or another market surveillance authority decides to prohibit the placing and supplying of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services, a fine of between EUR 1 000 and 5 000 (currently between EUR 868 and EUR 4 344) will be imposed.
Failure to remove dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between €2,500 and €6,500 (currently between €1,448 and €5,792).
If dangerous products have caused harm to the consumer's health, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 1 584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products cause the death of a consumer, a fine of between €6,500 and €25,000 (now €5,792 and €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, the penalty for infringement of product safety legislation is up to EUR 25 000 (minimum fine not specified), in Belgium, between EUR 26 000 and EUR 600 000, in Romania, between EUR 155 and EUR 6 666, and in Bulgaria between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500.

The Norwegian armed battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harshest areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital, Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Triple Engagement 2018" exercise - the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, most soldiers from the second battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan - that is, in the warm countries.
But they're the most skilled in Arctic warfare, and their skills are particularly useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the hills east of Tinsett, often the most remote and brutal of places, soldiers have been engaged in staged battles against real British soldiers.
The soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in the harsh climate they have to carry much more weight - one rucksack weighs about 100 pounds [50 kg].
The troops who are stationed at the headquarters say that their skills in how to survive and fight in these conditions are shared with other NATO troops.
The soldiers say that this exercise, which is like no other, is designed to remind them of real warfare and to prepare them for a serious threat.

Deputy Mayor of Kaunas has no plans to return to politics
Former Kaunas Vice Mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the "One Kaunas" organization because of his support for Vygaud Ušac during the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to concentrate on business.
I'm a shareholder in several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family,' Maciulis told BNS.
He also said that he had no intention of running in the forthcoming municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with V. Ušacku after he lost the primary elections of the Fatherland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrid Šimony.
"To be honest, we haven't had a chance to talk to him and the team about the results in detail and about future plans.
It is clear that once Vygaud has withdrawn from further elections, this stage of my life is over", said Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret his decision to leave Kaunas politics for supporting Ušačka, but regretted that "Lithuania has lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations".
He was briefly deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011 and returned to the post after the successful elections for Einem Kaunas in 2015.
He is a shareholder in the private school "Erudito Lycée" and several other companies.
The workers at the Kaunas castle: what are they doing here?
The Kaunas people, watching the workers at Kaunas Castle, were delighted to see that the restoration of the surviving tower was finally under way.
The director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrilius Sužiedelis, confirmed that work was underway to replace the protective roofing of the south-western tower with a fragment of the defensive wall.
According to my interviewer, the roofs are gonna be tarred.
'The emergency weathered roof was a hazard to the environment - people could fall and get hurt - and had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, and the heritage was also damaged", explained the museum director.
Will these roofs be the same as those that were built centuries ago?
'All the work is coordinated with the heritage and other institutions', added Mr Suleymans, 'in order to make the result as authentic as possible, but also in the practical sense - the roofs must protect the values from the humidity.
The universal solution is chosen in dealing with heritage.
Before that, the elements of the Kaunas Palace were covered by the Soviet era, so they no longer had any historical value", the director of the Kaunas City Museum explained.
The contract of employment was signed on 2 October.
The works are not expected to last longer than three months from the date of signing the contract.
"It is expected to be completed by the end of November", said the museum director.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the speaker, was foreseen in this year's budget.
The work at Kaunas Castle is carried out by the company Statia.
According to research, Kaunas castle may have looked like this before.
The U.S. and South Korea have resumed naval exercises.
A naval exercise involving about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks, the Ministry of Defense announced in Seoul.
The United States has 28,500 troops in South Korea.
The two countries have been conducting joint military exercises for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions against Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered", the North Korean foreign ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the sanctions would remain in place until Pyongyang renounces nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he will meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.
Maxima is expanding in Bulgaria - Business News
The largest retail company in the Baltic States, the Maxima Group, is expanding in Bulgaria, where it operates a T-Market chain of stores.
Maxima Bulgaria CEO Edwin Volkas told the business publication Capital that the company will open two more stores by the end of this year, bringing the total to 74.
Volko said that 7-10 more stores are planned to open in Bulgaria next year.
The company recently opened a new concept store in Sofia, T-Market Express, in which it invested EUR 1 million.
The "social zone" is open 24 hours a day, with free Internet access, a smartphone, sandwiches, salads, and other snacks.
According to Mr Volko, 2018 will be the first year in which the company will end with a positive EBITDA.
Mr. Volk forecasts that the revenue of Maxima Bulgaria will increase by 40% this year to 158,5 million euros.
Last year the company generated revenues of EUR 113,3 million.
The 'Maxima Group' has been active in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company was ranked among the top 10 retail chains in the country for the first time.
The Maxim Group, owned by the Vilnius Trading Group controlled by Nerijaus Numavičius, plans to invest some EUR 200 million this year and next, mainly in Poland, where Maxim has acquired the Stokrotka retail chain.
The group operates the retail chains Maxima and the online grocery store Barbora in the Baltic countries, and Stokrotka and Aldik in Poland.
The Commission also found that the Commission had not provided any information on the amount of the subsidy granted to the sampled companies.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies will be working with two prominent US "brain centers"
According to the head of the Vilnius-based RESC, Lino Kojala, who has been active for 13 years, the US presence will allow projects to be implemented and make Lithuania's voice heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We have been working towards this for several months.
I am glad that two major institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities for joint activities.
I am sure that the activities of the Niches will emerge, as our analyses of NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries are also priorities for them", said Kojala.
The agreements note that the RESC and US institutions will work together to prepare international project applications, exchange expertise and knowledge, and arrange expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
FPRI has been around since 1955 and brings together nearly 100 top-level analysts.
In the latest ranking of global think tanks by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work at the highest levels of US policy, is ranked 10th in the same category.
"This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to penetrate the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel", Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners disseminate the forthcoming RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review among US decision-makers and in the public sphere.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of projects implemented and is not supported by targeted grants.
The RESC partners with which it implements joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international foundations, etc.
Two buildings collapse in Marseille
Two people were slightly injured when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire department said.
The collapsing buildings sent debris and dust clouds into the streets.
Dozens of firefighters, some with trained dogs, were on duty near the site of the famous old port of Marseilles.
The local prefecture tweeted photos showing a pile of debris and wooden beams, a huge gap in the place where the buildings were, fireworks working on the scene and a car covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they're looking for people who may have been trapped under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
In a video shown by BFM-TV, dust clouds appear on the street, and passersby cover their mouths with handcuffs.
Google Street View images taken before the incident show that one of the collapsed buildings was five stories high, and the other was six stories high.
One of these buildings was clearly in a bad state, with windows that were boarded up, and large cracks in the facade.
The mayor of the Marseille district of Minimo, Sabine Bernasconi, said that one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.
But the mayor couldn't rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by people who had settled there.
The regional prefecture urged people to avoid the area and to clear roads for rescue services.
Minimo Marseille district mayor Sabine Bernascon said the building was in poor condition and was ordered to be evacuated.

Restaurant in Mexico helps deported immigrants from the United States
As more and more Mexicans are deported, they have a hard time adjusting to their new surroundings.
"When I was deported, they took everything from me: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything except one thing - my knowledge", says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's director.
The restaurant's board hopes that the combination of Mexican and American cultures will foster a better understanding between the two.
An Afghan Special Forces member shot and killed an American instructor during training.
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had taken a year off to serve in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but was due to return to work as mayor in January.
Another U.S. serviceman, who has not yet been named, was wounded in the attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
Officials say B. Taylor died from a gunshot wound by infantry.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army.
Utah media quoted a NATO report that Taylor was shot by one of the Special Forces soldiers and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His body is scheduled to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday afternoon.
He's had two tours in Iraq, and this is his second tour in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he was assigned to a battalion of advisors and instructors for one of that country's special forces.
Hundreds of North Ogden residents have taken to the streets of the town of about 17,000 to show their support for the mayor, who was escorted by police in a cart with his family.
Taylor became mayor in 2013.
