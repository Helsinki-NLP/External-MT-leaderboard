MG Baltic case: Gustav's new lawyer says he hasn't had time to look at the case file
The 11th hearing in the MG Baltic case on Monday was attended by all the accused: Sharunas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimond Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the defendants' demonstrations.
At the last court hearing, Alexander Doroshev, the new state-appointed lawyer for Gustav, told the jury that he had not yet been given access to the case file.
At that time, lawyer Linas Belevičius of MG Baltic argued that in order to ensure a full personal defence, the panel of judges must allow the new lawyer to have access to the case file and requested a stay of the hearing.
'To ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the file.
This is not just a formal meeting,' said Mr Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Doroshev, noted that he had not been able to read the indictment or the entire case file.
At the previous hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustainis, announced that he would not be able to afford a lawyer.
The hearing was also recorded.
The defendants' lawyers complained that the audio recordings submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The law enforcement authorities suspect that politicians, by taking bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions in favour of the group in the Seimas and other state institutions, as well as influenced the determination of the winners of public procurement, recalls ELTA.
The investigation involved more than 150 persons, including more than 50 current and former members of the Seimas, several former ministers and Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 interviews and more than 30 arrests were made.
Mr Gustainis is suspected of having received more than EUR 8 000 in bribes, Mr Steponavičius - EUR 15 000 and Mr Gapšys - EUR 27 000 respectively. Mr Masiulis is suspected of having received more than EUR 106 000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and influence trading, the Liberal Union of bribery, influence trading and abuse and MG Baltic of bribery and influence trading.
It is suspected that politicians negotiated with Mr Kurlianski, Vice-President of the MG Baltic Group, about the bribes and then proposed or supported initiatives in favour of the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Liberal Party's board is right about Vilnius chapter's actions
'The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes,' its chairman, Vytautas Tamošiūnas, told BNS after the committee meeting.
"Our decision was not a new one.
We had already made our explanation as a committee in July when the question of the Baggies and the Utenas was raised.
We said then that under the statute, it was a matter of board competence.
And if the board decides that a section can do what it wants to do, go with the committee and the board agrees, then the section can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has accepted, then it is a decision for all the sections to form party lists.
And if you disagree with the board, then there is the possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee", he added.
According to Tamoshiyun, the party board will now decide on further action.
On 17 October the Liberal Union Board of the party cancelled the decision of the Vilnius City Branch to participate in the municipal elections not with the party, but with the new list of the electoral committee of Buryam.
The party board believes that the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party statutes and the decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius chapter had to cancel its aspirations to participate in the municipal elections with the committee list.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the department, MP Aurshrine Armonaite, has already resigned from the Liberal Party.
Vilnius Mayor Remigijus Šimašius, former chairman of the Liberal Union, has already presented the team and ideas of the Public Elections Committee "For Vilnius, of which we are proud!"
He left the party too.
Municipal council and mayoral elections will be held in March next year.
Residents of a village in northern India drove a tractor over a tiger that had previously mauled a man, officials said Monday.
Mahavir Kaujlagis, a forestry official, said that after the tiger hit a man working in the fields late Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and drove the female tractor into the ground as she tried to escape.
Residents say that this tiger also attacked and mauled a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km southeast of the state capital Lucknow.
Tiger hunting is prohibited in protected areas.
The director of the reserve, Rameses Pandey, said that the incident would be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, villagers in the Nighasan district of Uttar Pradesh beat another tiger, which was severely injured.
The tiger is the national animal of India and is listed as an endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last year, government data showed that at least one person was killed every day in encounters with wild tigers or elephants during the previous three years.
Human conflict with tigers has been on the rise since the 1980's, when India began a tiger conservation program that established restrictions on tiger hunting in national parks and criminalized big cat hunting.
Although the methods used to count tigers have changed, censuses show that the population of about 1,800 tigers has increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
It is recommended that cats and dogs be labelled with mandatory micro-schemes
The Chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose that cats and dogs be labelled with underwear microschemes.
'We propose that cats and dogs be required to be labelled with underwear micro-squares and that their registration and labelling be organised by the local municipality, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so the residents will not have any problems and the costs will be covered by the state funding provided for this purpose", said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the Act aim to address the systematic need for the labelling of domestic animals.
It is hoped that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible animal breeders, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is provisionally estimated that, based on the expected average cost of the micro-scheme and the service, which will be around EUR 5, all owners of animals will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pets may reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is expected to spread over three years and reach EUR 2 million per year.
The labelling programmes are expected to be funded through the Municipal Environmental Support Special Programme, which will see a significant increase in revenue this year due to increased natural resource taxes and redistribution.
This will allow municipalities to use the funds not only for the marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Ms Mažeika, the practice of mandatory labelling is common in almost all EU countries, which also protects the animals themselves (since lost animals can be easily returned to their owners) and saves the time and resources of the farmers themselves when searching for a lost pet.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets may be used for travel.
At the same time, the labelling obliges the animal to be cared for responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals for mandatory labelling met with resistance because the programmes concerned were proposed to be financed by public funds.
'The current model should avoid this criticism, as animal protection is proposed to be financed by increased revenues in the Environmental Support Programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also members of the public, i.e. persons in animal welfare institutions who have taken special courses at the Veterinary Academy,' say the project authors.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilis, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government troops killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers had been killed.
He added that four other soldiers were wounded in the attack on the joint army and police checkpoint in Chogani district.
According to Noor, six Taliban fighters were killed and 10 more wounded in the three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media claiming responsibility for Monday's attack in Ghazni province.
Noori said that the post was established two days ago in a strategic area to cut off a supply route for the Taliban.
The attack completely destroyed the post.
"Morning" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be played at the Vilnius "Ryto" arena, where Kosovo and Ukraine will meet.
The fight will be held in the capital for political reasons.
After maintaining warm relations with the Ukrainian basketball team, Vilnius "Morning" will host Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Prishtina "KB Prishtina" teams on November 7 under its own roof in the "Morning" arena.
"Due to political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not host this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to host us", said Maksim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team.
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well.
Lithuania is one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We hope to have support from the Vilnius.
The Kosovo team was unable to enter Ukraine because the two countries do not have diplomatic relations.
Currently, the Ukrainian team is in third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position and has more wins.
This will be a very important group E acistate, as only two teams will advance to the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius has also hosted the Ukraine-Kosovo national team qualification match for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated the victory 100:61.
The game is free to basketball fans on Wednesday, and the match will start at 7:00.
"Women Lie Better" star B Arsobayev is being stalked by liars
It's probably just a coincidence, but the charming brunette actress Brigita Arsobait has already been cast in a number of roles involving liars.
First the TV show "Women Lie Better", then the show "Lies", and finally the comedy "Lies".
In this film, Brigitte plays the playful wife of the hero of the play, Dino Kazlausko.
"I really enjoyed making 'The Miracle' because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely go to the movies.
The team of amazing colleagues that we put together promised a great result from the very beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the pitch was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I've never been a fan of those little decorative fife fours.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and I even tried to buy her from the owner, but I failed", the actress smiles.
The comical and intriguing peripetias of family members are already being explored from the first minutes by the new Lithuanian comedy "Melagai", produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Neeksperęs" and "Between us, boys"... producer Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your lover just called in, she's expecting.
That would be great news, except... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Before the "good news" is shared with all, the parents suddenly say: "They are different!"
After 50 years together...
And all this just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such a nuclear explosion.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance...
Besides B. Arsobaitė, the four generations of film stars in the comedy "Melagiai" give the audience a good mood: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy "Liars" is in theaters November 9th.
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes from emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted the amendment to the Declaration of Residence Act prepared by the leader of the "citizens" Ramun Karbauski.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 voted against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then consider the amendments on or after 6 December, after receiving the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their intention to leave Lithuania.
According to the MEP, in three years a person does not pay around EUR 1,000, whereas now there are around 100 000.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that the Seimas would thus "encourage some people to break their obligations" to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
Antanas Matulas, a conservative member of the Health Affairs Committee, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from coming to Lithuania for treatment by paying a small health insurance fee - they are provided with the same services as residents who pay this tax.
The amendments provide that persons who pay social security contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation and are exempted from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania by Sodra will be considered to have left Lithuania.
The head of Sodra, Mindaugas Sinkevičius, has previously said that such a step will facilitate the lives of emigrants and the activities of Sodra.
A video of a gliding bear leaked online reveals a serious problem
The cubs climb, slide, and then continue to push.
The video received many views and comments.
People admired the little bear's tenacity - after slipping down several times, he climbed back up to his mother.
He does not succeed at first, but the baby does not even try to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The video is truly attention-grabbing, but it also reveals the threat humans pose to the animals.
Scientists say that it is also important to talk about the harm that can be caused by people's desire to explore the natural world.
"I can see that the bear drone was very frightening.
Their movements show that they are panicking.
If the drone hadn't been flying around, they would probably have taken a safer route or gone slower or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used", said ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
Not long ago, Mr Ditmer and his colleagues were studying the effects of drones on bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, some of the bears would run, others would not run, but their hearts would beat faster in fear.
Scientists advise that drones be used responsibly, not flying too close, not making noise, and not flying where it is forbidden to film animals.
The president-elect was approached by a newspaper
A court in Kiev on Tuesday summoned ousted President Viktor Yanukovych to Russia for an unusual hearing on his alleged treason case, the state newspaper said.
A court summons published in the government news paper, the Uryadovoi Kuryer, invites the former leader to appear at a criminal trial hearing on November 19 where he could be heard in his closing arguments.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych has the right to participate in the hearing by video link.
On 30 October, the Kiev court declared the debate in the Yanukovych case over.
Mr. Yanukovych's lawyer in Russia, Alexander Goroshinsky, was given until November 19 to register with the Foreign Lawyers Register to attend the hearing, where Mr. Yanukovych is expected to deliver his final speech via video link.
The Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising in February 2014, triggered by the president's refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and soon thereafter, war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, fighting has claimed some 10,000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
The list of conservatives in the Vilnius City Council will be led by Valdas Benkunskas
The Conservative candidate for the year was confirmed earlier by former Minister of Economy, MP Dainius Kreivys.
During the Conservative primary election weekend, party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, the leader of the list of conservatives was V. Benkunskas, chairman of the Congress of the Vilnius chapter of the TS-LKD.
The first ten candidates included members of the Vilnius City Council Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former Seimas member Liutauras Kazlavickas, the chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Godazija Karaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils will be held in Lithuania on 3 March next year.
The restrictions on cogeneration plants are being appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition in the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) against the ruling decision to pass a law on the possibility of halting the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition Seimas faction of the Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that a group of Seimas members had asked the Central Committee to investigate the constitutionality of the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by the ruling party.
"Parliamentarians emphasize that the provisions of the law aim to challenge the projects of waste incineration plants already underway, by ordering the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) on waste incineration plants that are being built in Vilnius and Kaunas before the law enters into force", the statement reads.
'Parliaments note that, in view of the way in which the law has formulated the prohibition on the construction of waste facilities of national importance (i.e. the distance and definition of the concept of 'living area'), it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for energy, since the criteria have been formulated in such a way that, given the density of the Lithuanian population and the distribution of the country, the construction of such facilities would be practically impossible throughout the country', it adds.
The complaint alleges that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'The CJ has repeatedly stated that legislation does not apply to legal acts which have been made and which have arisen before the entry into force of a newly adopted act.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law retroactively, based on an indeterminate criterion.
The establishment of such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and, therefore, the constitutional principle of the rule of law,' the application states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants projects.
The suspension of the current projects would not only result in financial losses of hundreds of millions of euros, but also huge losses for the Lithuanian population, including higher heating costs and increased pollution from the increasing amount of waste in landfills.
The appeal to the Committee was signed by members of the Seimas from the TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democratic groups and the deputy of the ruling Social Democratic Labour group Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes in the ruling party to override the veto of President Dalija Grybauskaite on the amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provide the government with the right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants already underway and set a "quarantine zone" 20 km from residential areas for such plants.
The amendments to the law, which were re-adopted by the Seimas, will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
The proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to suspend projects already underway is not envisaged.
The CoR will examine this case in order of priority, not earlier than after one year.
LeBron James's questionable stats were released by the Lakers.
LeBron James's start at the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization, and the basketball fans expected.
The Lakers have started the season with four wins and six losses, and a poor start has fueled rumors of a possible firing of coach Luke Walton.
However, the president of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, calmed the rumours, saying that the coach would not be fired, but that he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should be back on his feet.
Although the forward's statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
The first ten games of the season were marked by other statistics showing that the Lakers are playing better without L. James on the field.
The striker is disadvantaged by a +/- statistic, which shows how many more points a team scores or loses when certain players are on the pitch.
With L. James on the court, the Lakers have outscored their opponents by 30 points this season.
With him on the bench, the Lakers outscored their opponents by 19 points.
The Lakers are currently only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few wins could turn everything upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuania's airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the airspace protection of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
'Lithuania highly values Spain's cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and the region,' said Minister Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air policing and air policing reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, three of them in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighters were deployed in the Nordic region was between May and August this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the airspace defence of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication issues in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to work closely together on the European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador Jose Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, the letters of credence were presented by José Maria Robles Fraga to President Dalila Grybauskaite.
Thank you for arresting Mr. Acho: I believe in his innocence and the rule of law
"It was the most surprising thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, perhaps the services are doing what they are supposed to do.
We're all doing our jobs.
I trust the law enforcement, I trust my husband, that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest actions should be done", said BNS.
Mr. Ača was detained by the Special Investigations Service (STT) on Monday, when law enforcement officials suspected that he had taken a large bribe while still a director of the administration of the municipality of Raseiniai, in exchange for which he could have provided exceptional conditions to a private company that had signed a contract with the municipality-run Raseiniai bus park.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having directly bought up R. Ache or of having participated in the cover-up of bribes in various financial transactions.
The Council of the Raseiniai District Municipality dismissed R. Ača from his position as head of administration in April this year, following a motion of no confidence.
The former "orderly" became a member of the newly founded Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilos in March this year, and he suspended his membership of this party on Monday.
Mr. Acha ran unsuccessfully for mayor several years ago as a representative of the electoral committee "Two Raseiniai".
Achenie says that the man had no intention of running for mayor of Raseiniai next year, but had not yet decided whether to run for the municipal council.
V. Achenė is a member of the Seimas on the list of the Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union, and is a member of the Seimas' Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she is waiting for further law enforcement action - depending on whether she will step down from the commission.
"I'm not really making any decisions today, I think I'll make one this week.
I'll see if there's a need to press charges, and of course, I'll make a decision one way or another.
I may have to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's time to put everything in its place", she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, called on Viktor Pranckieti, the Speaker of the Seimas, and Ramūna Karbauski, the leader of the "citizens", to distance themselves from the statements of their colleague from the group, Vida Ačienė, and to remove her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, by transferring her to work in another Seimas committee or commission.
She claims that the continued work of V. Achenna in the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission 'would cause a justified lack of trust in the public and discredit the work of an important parliamentary oversight commission'.
The emotional music of Coldplay has also attracted the attention of a famous Lithuanian couple
On a bright Monday night, a crowd of music and movie fans gather for the preview of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a whole host of famous people: John and Simon Nainiai, Ignace Lely, Martyn Tyla and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular pop bands, Coldplay, intertwined with moments from their live shows.
Documentary director Matt Whitecross met the band when they were still playing in bars with only a few dozen people.
The film features never before seen footage from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals or leisure.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman, and a little later, drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and released their first recording, Safety, just twenty years ago, which featured three songs.
Of the 500 copies of the recording, most were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, while only 50 copies of Safety were ever sold.
Today, Coldplay is a band known, respected, and loved worldwide, with seven albums that have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
V. Čupaikitis, who led Juventus to victory, was named MVP of the LKL week.
After a solid match in the front of Betsafe-LKL, the Utenna Juventus tall Vaid Čopakitis won the title of most valuable player of the week.
The centre scored a double, which helped Juventus to beat Alytus's Djurkias 86-77 in extra time.
In the almost 31 minutes played, V. Čepukaitis scored 13 points (5/6 doubles) and recovered 11 balls.
In addition, the tall man caused seven losses, took three wickets and made four successful passes.
These indicators guaranteed 30 points of usefulness.
This season, V. Čepukaitis has 17.2 points of utility and this is the best performance of his career in the 11th season of the LKL.
Height is the fourth most productive player this season.
The top five winners of the week were Martynas Gecevičius and Kšištofas Lavrinovičius (both from Priennys "Skycop"), Yannickas Franke (Pasvalos "Milk Stars") and Jerai Grant (Klaipėdos "Neptunus").
Just recently, the Legionnaire Y. Franke, who recently joined the team, scored 24 points, recovered 10 balls and caused 8 opponents to lose, scoring 31 useful points in the 88:93 loss to the Prieny Skycop.
True, he was not named MVP of the week because of the team's loss.
The chain of defenders in the fifth with the legionnaire of Pavel's team is formed by his opponent of the day - M.Gecevičius, representing the team of Prienė.
He scored 19 points and grabbed 9 rebounds.
These scores gave the sniper 26 points for usefulness.
In the high-level chain you can see another Skycop basketball player - K. Lavrinovičius scored 15 points in Sunday's match (3/4 second, 9/11 penalty), provoked 7 opponents' losses and collected 23 utility points.
The fifth place was also taken by J. Grant, a striker of Klaipeda Neptuno who played a powerful match in Vilnius.
The American scored 25 points, grabbed 4 rebounds, and took 3 assists for 29 points in 25 minutes.
This legionary performance allowed the Knights of the Round Table to triumph in the capital against the local Dawn 78:66.
The highest incidence of influenza in one of the cities
The incidence of influenza and acute upper respiratory infections (UTI) decreased nationwide last week.
According to the Centre for Infectious Diseases and AIDS (ULAC), the total incidence of influenza and HCV in Lithuania between 29 October and 4 November was 49.9 cases per 10 000 inhabitants.
The previous week, the figure was 68.1 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.

Palestinian attacked Israelis with a knife in West Bank shooting
The soldier "prevented this attack by identifying the terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF soldier", the IDF said in a statement about the incident near the town of Kiryat Arba, near Hebron.
"The soldier fired on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
The report added that the Israeli military had "not been able to stop the violence".
A military spokeswoman told AFP the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
The video footage from the incident shows him with minor injuries.
A similar wave of Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
Although such attacks have declined in recent years, there are fears of a new wave.
On October 22, a Palestinian was shot and killed after stabbing a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskaitė urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries to facilitate foreign imports.
At the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Ms Grybauskaitė stressed that given the signs of an economic slowdown, the common goal of Europe and China should be to 'join forces to stop the spread of protectionism in the world', addressing the root causes of the trade war-induced tensions, 'overproduction and unfair competition'.
'The European Union values China's commitment to a more attractive, open investment environment, which is important in the negotiation of a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, and strengthening the protection of intellectual property", said D. Grybauskaitė.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese exporting producer did not provide any evidence that the Chinese exporting producer was in a position to sell the product concerned to the Union.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that investment transparency must be 'prior to the interests of any business group'.
'Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international agreements - these must be essential elements for the new investment environment,' stressed Ms Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries", she added.
The Chinese import fair is trying to assuage criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its companies.
The exhibition will be attended by heads of state from a dozen countries and more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistical Office, China currently ranks 25th among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China increased by 50 percent to EUR 180 million.
The Commission established the profitability of the Union industry by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring about undesirable political influence, and Beijing's focus on Eastern Europe is dividing the EU's unity.
The inconvenience has been resolved: the mobile signature service is now operational
The mobile signature provider, the Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions, reports that the failure of the mobile signature system has been resolved and the service is operating as normal.
The mobile signature was restored at 2:28 p.m.
The mobile signature system went down at 9:52 a.m. on Monday.

Lion Air crash: family members angry
The black box data from the crashed Lion Air flight showed a speedometer malfunction on at least four of its last flights, investigators said on Monday.
Soerjanto Tjahjono, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC), said similar mishaps had occurred on the plane's last four flights, including the fatal one that crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on October 29.
All 189 people on board the plane died in the crash.
Several media outlets reported on the previous flight of a Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the technical problem was actually airspeed, in other words the speed of the plane", Mr. Tjahjono told a press conference.
'The black box data showed that the same problem was also present on two flights before the Denpasar-Jakarta flight,' he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to clarify that the black box (data) contains four flights where there were problems with the airspeedometer", the head of the NTSC said.
During a meeting with family members of the deceased, Mr. Tjahjono said that the information from the flight recorder matched reports that the plane had a disorderly change in speed and altitude after taking off on its last flight.
Search teams have yet to find the second black box recording the cockpit conversations.
Lion Air stated that after a technical failure was detected on a flight from Bali to Jakarta, it was repaired according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak at a meeting of transport minister Budi Karyas Sumadi, who moderated a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains and the investigation into the disaster.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, present himself.
Lion Air behaved badly", said a man who identified himself as Shandy Johan Ramadan, the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island where the plane crashed.
'I want to draw the attention of Mr Rusdi Kirana and his team,' he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed us no compassion".
After the meeting, Mr Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families wait for the results of the long process of identifying the deceased.
Nearly 140 body bags of human remains were handed over to police medical experts.
So far, only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives questioned why the plane, which had been in service for two months, was allowed to fly after a malfunction on the flight from Bali to Jakarta on October 28, including the horrific crash of the plane shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said that the glitch was fixed.
"Is it true that the problem has been solved?" asked one of the sons of the dead.
- If not, the technicians involved must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they didn't say the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law to prevent plane crashes in Indonesia.
Mr. Tjahjono said that the large amount of small debris and the fact that the debris spread over a relatively small area suggested that the liner likely crashed into the water at very high speed.
"The plane was intact when it went overboard.
It did not explode in mid-air and the aircraft's engines were turning at high speeds when it hit the water, indicating all the broken turbine blades", the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers led from the rubble: victim and minor
On Monday evening, a BMW and a Mercedes-Benz collided on the road between Vėžaičiai and Plungė, near Tilvikis.
There was a head-on collision between two vehicles, and three people were reported injured.
The driver of a BMW, born in 1999, reportedly drove on the opposite side of the road and collided head-on with a Mercedes-Benz, driven by a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the rubble by firefighters and rescuers.
The Mercedes-Benz girl had her teeth knocked out in the crash.
All victims to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial easing of the referendum
If the Seimas approves the government's proposal to reduce the referendum ballot for the first section of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half the population voted for the Constitution - that is the requirement.
This and its amendment, especially the articles in its first section, should certainly be approved by a majority of at least .
Do not hesitate to assume that the president will actually veto", said Dalias Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser to the news radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental state matters - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, so reducing the number of votes needed to change these articles, according to Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "reverse uncontrollable risks".
"The President believes that there is no need for any artificial easing, but rather for preparation for the referendum itself, for more dialogue with the people", he said.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision to amend the first and fourteenth sections of the Constitution with greater protection is to be taken if it is supported by at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote in a referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote can amend the articles of Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by referendum.
The right to vote in Lithuania is enjoyed by about 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal was born after the Seimas in September approved the presidential veto on amendments previously adopted by the Parliament that relaxed the requirements for the number of votes for changing citizenship, which defines Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution.
The referendum is proposed to be shortened in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which is due to take place on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential elections are scheduled.
Emigrants who emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently not allowed to hold dual nationality, with some exceptions.
The Lithuanian community around the world is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that the referendum will not take place under the current conditions - not enough people will come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are 'crazy' and therefore need to be upgraded
The infrastructure of Lithuania's airports and roads is beginning to deteriorate and needs to be upgraded, says Transport Minister Rokas Masiulis.
The Commission notes that the airport was not able to provide any information on the airport's infrastructure.
'The air transport infrastructure is already in disrepair as it was designed for lower passenger traffic.
We have to renovate Vilnius airport - it's not even in the long-term planning, it's the minimum we have to do", Masiulis said at a communication conference organised by the Foundation for the Development of Democracy and the magazine "Valstybė" on Tuesday.
According to the minister, the next decade will be very important because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, Klaipėda's external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to finish the integration of roads, railways, the construction of Klaipėda's external port, the repair of airports, perhaps decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must stay awake and start projects now that will realise our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time", said the Minister for Transport.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that in recent years there has been too little funding for road maintenance.
'The road situation is not improving yet because of insufficient funding.
We manage to build new roads, but even the most basic maintenance, like the highways, is underfunded.
We have to determine how much should be spent on road maintenance if we want to improve the condition of the roads,' said Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuania's exports of transport services grew by 18.6% this year, with Germany becoming the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal to require EU carriers to periodically return their vehicles to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
I think it is absurd to suggest that the trucks should always be brought home, because driving empty trucks in Europe would burn fuel and increase emissions.
The main beneficiaries are the railways, as the cost increases will be such that some transport will be transferred to the railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions", Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Transport, 12,2% are generated in the transport sector.
The total value of the assets of the Bank shall be the sum of the assets of the Bank and the assets of the Bank.
It employs more than 118,000 people and has more than 7,500 enterprises.
Dispute with the Heirs
Last week, Mr Masiulis announced in the Seimas' Economics Committee that he had started negotiations on changing the cultural use of the building at Vilnius Airport - this would allow the old terminal to be demolished and a new one built.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimantas Degutis called Mr Masiuli's deliberations political pressure.
He said that the building, built in the 1960s, was a listed building in 1993 and that it was not the politicians but professionals who should decide on its removal.
The Commission also noted that the airport was not a new airport.
"To take this old terminal out of the heritage would be a politically important step, so that it can be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal built, so that arriving in Vilnius you feel like a modern country, not an interesting one that really does not represent our country as innovative", Masiulis said in the Seimas last week.
The Commission also notes that the airport was not able to provide any information on the number of passengers and the number of passengers.
The transport hub is expected to be operational in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
The Commission notes that the airport was not able to provide any information on the number of passengers and that the airport was not able to provide any information on the number of passengers and the number of passengers.

Direct flights to Madagascar from Vilnius to start next year
The largest regular passenger plane, the Boeing 767, will land at Vilnius airport next spring, flying passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bé, which belongs to Madagascar, according to the travel operator Itaka Lietuva's website madeinvilnius.lt.
It is announced that passengers on Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economy class and 8 business class seats.
The new destination will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominik Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that efforts are being made to offer Lithuanian tourists new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of eastern Africa.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the amount of aid to be recovered from the beneficiary.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start direct flights from Vilnius to Tirana, Albania.
Finance Minister on the potential crisis: it is important not to talk about the disease
"We must always be prepared for the worst.
What I want to celebrate is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuania's history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about the disease,' said Ms Shapoka during a visit to Brussels on Monday.
The European Commission has launched a new initiative to promote the use of the euro as a currency for the European Union's external relations.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
The new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or are planning to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how income from the provision of certain digital services should be taxed in EU Member States until there is agreement at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as not meeting the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the Commission has used this opportunity.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss issues of deepening Economic and Monetary Union: the possibility of implementing a European Deposit Insurance Scheme and reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role of the ESM in financial assistance programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM should be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently, the 120th anniversary of the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural historian, ethnographer and geographer Balio Burača (1897-1972) was celebrated in Sidari, Šiauliai village, in the then Šiauliai governorate.
As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the State of Lithuania, we have an excellent opportunity to remember how the life-giving national revival called many Lithuanians, including the Burač brothers - Bali, Jon, Bronis - from the depths of the countryside to engage with all their creative powers in nurturing, making meaningful and preserving our cultural traditions.
Balys Buracz, who has been travelling around his native country for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, has provided a broad and realistic picture of the customs, traditions, folk art and material culture of our country.
He was a conservationist who sought to preserve the nation's rapidly dying cultural treasures and had a rare ability to appreciate the enduring value of his work.
In Bali Burač's photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, hills, everyday life and celebrations are immortalized by our people in national costumes, which adorn the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a large part of the legacy of Bali Burach, describing the national working practices and associated traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material presented shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and a heavy occupation.
The manuscript contains a very rich description of the works, festivals and other traditions and customs of the people of Zemaitia, especially the Kubishcheans, Šiauliai, Telšiši, and the people of Ukshaiti and Dzukija, as well as the traditions and customs recorded by Bali Burač.
From some 10,000 surviving negatives in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs have been selected for this publication, grouped by selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture characteristic of the Kupiškeni, Dzuki, other regions of Upper and Lower Saxony.
In Panevėžys, a suspect escaped from a police car in handcuffs and was released after four hours.
How the young man (born 1994) managed to escape from the company car is still unclear.
He was taken into custody on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., police released a photo of the fugitive and appealed to the public for help: "Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994), a Burmese man suspected of stealing a company car, escaped.
The person escaped with his wrists.

Tragic Couple Died Within Hours of Marriage
A newlywed couple died in a helicopter crash in southwestern Texas, U.S.A., just hours after their wedding.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife of the same age, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, were killed shortly after midnight Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a hill 10 miles northwest of Jubilee and 80 miles west of San Antonio, local justice Steven Kennedy said.
The strange thing is that the accident occurred about 15 miles [24 km] after the flight, about the same age as the bride and groom.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The couple attended Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas, where they met.
They were married on Saturday night at the Bailers' ranch near Juwaldi and flew out of the wedding party in a family helicopter.
The helicopter crashed about 15 miles (24 km) downwind.
The couple flew to San Antonio International Airport, where they were planning to board a plane and fly on their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven area, and the hill is about 400 to 500 feet [120 to 150 m] high", said Kennedy.
Mr. Lawrence flew the family planes for many years.
According to S.J. Kennedy, he was a helicopter pilot and served in Vietnam.
An autopsy should determine the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could have caused the crash.
The helicopter crashed about five to ten minutes after takeoff.
The wreckage was seen in a wide radius on a rocky hillside, and the hull remained "dangerously hanging", said Craig Hatch, an aviation safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators plan to remove the debris and then examine it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for a tractor and truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the crash has not yet been determined and the NTSB's preliminary report is expected in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day", Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day when the United States, under President Trump, imposes particularly severe sanctions on Iran, the most severe sanctions on Iran in the entire period since the beginning of the effort to curb its aggression", the Israeli prime minister said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls "the toughest ever", came after Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from a deal with world powers over Tehran's nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by about one million barrels a day since May, and cutting off international financing to Tehran.
Israel has long opposed the Iran deal, saying it is too limited in scope and timing.
The Jewish state also claims that the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to establish itself there militarily.
The other parties to the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the U.S. decision and say the deal has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, as originally envisaged.
The court is again probing the circumstances of the young motorcyclist's death.
In the case of the death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, the court will hear the testimony of a witness.
The Vilnius District Court decided on Tuesday that one of the witnesses in the case will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
The acquittal in this case has already been announced, but the prosecution disagrees with it.
On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, of causing the death of a motorcyclist after he claimed that the motorcyclist was speeding in the city and had committed a serious offense.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office asks the District Court to set aside the judgment of the District Court and claims that E. Osipov is primarily to blame for the accident, and that the District Court's findings are unfounded.
The family of the dead motorcyclist is also seeking a mistrial.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 at around 15:00 when a Škoda Fabia driven by E. Osipov from Lakuny Street entered Žirmuny Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the traffic rules and causing a traffic accident that killed a man on a Piaggio motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports indicated that the scooter driver was killed, but later investigations found that the vehicle was powered by a motorcycle.
Vilnius District Court Judge Roland Bužinskas told BNS that the experts determined that the motorcycle driver was traveling at a speed of 55 miles per hour [89.2 km/ hr], although the speed limit in that area is 30 miles per hour [50 km/ hr].
"The driver of the car could not have foreseen that the motorcycle would be going at such a high speed", the judge said.
At the time, the elderly driver claimed to be traveling at only five or six miles an hour.
The motorcyclist saw an obstacle and tried to stop and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecutor's office believes that E. Osipov, who was driving on the main road, should have given way to the motorcyclist.
Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner mercenaries have been killed in Syria
The death toll included five members of the Syrian Armed Forces and six individuals belonging to the Wagner military company.
This is reported by the source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Army Corps is deployed in the area, joined by a number of Syrian volunteers and 'mercenaries'.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry for information on the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had a brief love affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to RTBF, he can appeal to the Supreme Court against the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, Delphine's mother's ex-husband, was neither biologically nor legally the artist's father.
Delphine requested that the investigation be carried out so that she could be recognised as the 'real' daughter of Father Albert.
The CEC will give money to the parties, but nothing to the social workers
The Central Election Commission (CEC) is planning to allocate a budgetary grant of almost 3 million euros to the major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), founded in spring this year and led by Parliament's Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilos, has not yet received any budgetary allocations.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CoR if the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošityte, the chair of the CoR, informed the HCJ that 'a meeting of the committee is planned for this Thursday to decide on the allocation of the half-yearly budgetary allocation to the parties'.
She said the decision on the matter must be taken by the CoC by 15 November.
EUR 2.751 million is allocated to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the ruling Union of States and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Liberal Union - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own parliamentary group, about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined ruling Justice and Order Party - almost EUR 0.22 million, the Christian Family Union, which is represented in Parliament but neither the ruling nor the opposition, will contribute to the Polish election campaign - about EUR 0.18 million.
The current law, which will be followed by the JRC, allocates budgetary funds to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
The current legal framework therefore prevents the LSDDP, which was set up in the spring of this year, from expecting to receive any budgetary support.
This party has not yet participated in any election.
The ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to the three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The relevant amendments to the Political Parties and Budget Law adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on the veto, but representatives of the ruling party, Mr Kirkil and the leader of the Green Peasants, Ramūnas Karbauskis, say that the parliamentarians will seek to overrule the president's objections.
However, this will not be possible before the meeting of the High Council on Thursday, so, according to Mr Matjošaitytė, 'the grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed so far'.
However, the head of the HRC did not rule out that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this week or next and new amendments on the allocation of budgetary funds to parties come into force, the Commission may consider a decision on the allocation of additional subsidies to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment in place when we make a decision, because we are the executive body responsible for implementing the laws that are being passed", she said.
If the Seimas were able to override the veto and the new laws came into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties, with the additional appropriations borrowed.
The grants already allocated to the seven parties would not be affected by this decision.
The results of Šiaulių bankas were used to sell shares
The report on the results of the third quarter of the year was published on Monday by Šiaulių bankas and received the most attention at the Baltic Exchange, where the positive reaction was soon followed by a response from sellers.
The Vilnius stock exchange index rose 0.46%, shares in Riga fell 0.49%, the Tallinn stock exchange index fell 0.18%, and the OMX Baltic Benchmark fell 0.07%.
The three exchanges carried out 478 transactions for EUR 762.172.
Poroshenko: Those who ordered the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to state that no version - and there are more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be subject to a very thorough screening procedure.
I, as president, have no right or obligation to receive information that could harm the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and law enforcement agencies must work efficiently.
Only in this way will the truth be known and evil punished", Poroshenko said at a youth meeting in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the investigation of Handziuk's murder and in the "acceptance of the necessary responsibility" of the murderers, organizers and commissioners.
"After this case was changed to murder (case), they are fairly and justifiably facing life imprisonment", the Ukrainian president said.
He called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of the case justified.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the authorities are determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not help clarify the situation but would only confuse matters further.
"I call on all, both the government and the opposition, not to waste time on unfounded arguments and, by God, not to use this murder for public relations", the president said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - one that builds public confidence.
We just don't have a choice".
"Nobody will be allowed to use this situation to destabilise the situation in the country", he assured.
Handziuk, who fought corruption, was attacked and acid-stained in Kherson in July.
She was the adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka tendered his resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, the authorities were accused by public activists of failing to properly investigate.
Activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Interior.
'Today I am resigning,' Mr Lucenka told MPs as he read out his investigation report.
The resignation of the prosecutor has yet to be approved by Parliament.
Lucenka accused the activists of pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify those responsible for Handziuk's murder.
Bill Gates introduced the waterless toilet.
In introducing the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional toilets to plumbing to the computer revolution of the 1980's.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn't require running water in a sewer, Reuters reported.
The waterless toilet operates on the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest health breakthrough of the last 200 years", Bill Gates was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was created by a charitable foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Seven years of work on a plant that could turn human waste into fertilizer or water, and the foundation spent $200 million on it.
In all, according to Bill Gates, there were about 20 models of toilets.
The plant is now ready for sale.
But to make these toilets mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend another $200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, poor sanitation kills 500,000 children under the age of five worldwide each year.
Fighting problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, is increasing spending on health care, which already stands at $233 billion.
To illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates put a glass of feces in the toilet.
He says that this is a good reminder that a small sample "can contain 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 worm eggs".
S. Slyva elected as President of the Football Association of the Masses
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
Following the request of Anatoli Stecenko to resign as President of the Association, an extraordinary general meeting of the Association's members was convened.
It was attended by 13 of the 15 members.
The main item on the agenda was the election of a new President.
Two candidates took part in the elections - Sergei Slyva and Vaidot Rasten.
Eleven members of the association voted for S.Slyva, two members voted for V.Rasten.
Mr Slyva will complete the term of office of Mr Stecenko, which will run until January 2021.
France: Concerns over deaths
French health officials announced a permanent ban on a widely used pesticide on Monday, amid concerns about dozens of recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The health protection agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products containing the pesticide methane was taken after a new safety inspection started earlier this year, at least three weeks before the poisoning waves in the departments of Maine and Loire.
The government had already banned the use of pesticides because of these cases.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
The product must be used in large quantities to be effective.
In France, about 700 tonnes were used annually.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, in the Anje region, a large producer of lettuce, complained of eye and throat swelling and respiratory problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they have not hastened it", said François Weber, deputy director of the ANSES, to the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
Methane, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the United States and Europe, is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The pesticide, marketed under the names Wapam and Sectagon, is authorised in Europe until 2022 when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to take it off the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives", Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that lettuce growers will face, farmers in general, but public health is more important", she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
This region, near Nantes, produces more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed in Europe each year.
Next season there will be "much less lettuce, radishes and porridge" after the government banned the use of metham last month, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes Breeders' Federation, told AFP.
EUR 70 million invested in a shopping centre with a viewing circle in Tallinn
The new T1 shopping centre, in which the local real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp has invested EUR 70 million, will open in the Estonian capital next weekend.
The total area of the shopping centre, which is 130,000 square metres or 55,000 square metres for rent, will be 150 shops, services and entertainment venues, and more than 30 cafes and restaurants, the developer said in a statement.
By comparison, Vilnius' Acropolis has a total area (including office space) of about 110,000 square metres, while the area for rent is 91,000 square metres.
T1 is the first shopping centre to have a rooftop viewing circle, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
The project will also integrate international transport gateways: tram stops and shortly intercity buses.
The main railway terminal of Rail Baltica is also located nearby and is expected to handle 1 million passengers per year around 2026.
According to Paul Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, the global shopping centre business is undergoing fundamental changes and T1 has managed to stay ahead of them.
"We have created a new generation of shopping malls that provide an experience and emotion that is not available online.
It is a place of attraction in the very centre of the city, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthwhile attraction and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family,' quotes Michelozzi in a press release.
A Focus on Entertainment
According to the shopping centre manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
The total area of the entertainment facility is 12 000 m2, or one fifth of the total area rented.
A special emphasis is placed on the observation wheel on the roof.
It will raise guests to a height of 120 metres above sea level - Talyn's highest point being the TV tower.
The Super Skypark will be located on the fourth floor of the circuit, where the largest batting centre in Europe and the first batting and net court in Estonia will open, the company says.
The interactive SkyLAB Research and Discovery Centre promises to keep children occupied for at least five to six hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree panoramic 4D cinema.
In addition to the regular cinema, which is shown in six halls, visitors will also be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with an interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the motion picture-like chairs, the feel of the real world is enhanced by the effects of wind, rain or snow, as well as the selected smells, smoke or fog in the theater.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic and the Frankfurt stock exchanges.
Last year, the group generated sales revenue of EUR 1.8 million in Lithuania and made a loss of EUR 350,000, according to the financial statements of Pro Kapital Grupp.
In 2016, sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and net profit of EUR 2,4 million were generated on the Lithuanian market.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon's controversial election puts Paul Biya in office for a seventh term
At a ceremony presided over by Parliament Speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, 85-year-old Biya vowed to protect the "unity and unity" of the West African state.
Africa's oldest president, in power for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was marred by low voter turnout, violence and allegations of fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration of Mr. Bia, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted from a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking, and one fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, protests against alleged discrimination in education, the judiciary and the economy in the North West and neighbouring South West Provinces led to demands for autonomy.
In 2017, after Biya refused to yield, the radicals declared an independent state, the 'Republic of Ambazonia', and took up arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed this year in separatist attacks and government response operations.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many are forced to live half-starved in the forests.
In October, only 5% of the electorate voted in the North West region, compared with 15% in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Biya received two-thirds of the vote.
Conservative primaries: mistakes led to inexperience
"If there was something missing, the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities have allowed us to use their premises, but there are not all polling stations because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent", said the politician.
It claims that the complaints received do not change the substance of the complaints and that the infringements themselves are not of a malicious nature.
"It was hard.
Not all the people who voted were experienced - they were new to it too.
So from that experience, not all of the actions were consistent with our order.
Therefore, the CRC had to be warned to comply with the principles we have described.
These complaints do not, however, give rise to any doubts about the results", said Anušauskas.
According to the CRC Chairman, there were cases where ballots were not stamped and when they were discovered, the unstamped ballots found in the ballot boxes were cancelled.
Some towns were short of space, but according to Anušausko, the complaints and violations concern several dozen tickets.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it doesn't really make a substantial difference to the election results", Anušauskas explained.
The party's voter turnout was reported to be 55%, while the turnout of non-party voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people working on the committees.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged - 79% of voters (16418 votes) voted for Ingrid Šimonytė, while Vygauda Ušacka received 21% (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will officially endorse I. Šimonytė's candidacy in the presidential elections to be held in May next year.
Trump says he's not likely to meet Putin in Paris.
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton said earlier that Trump would meet with Putin in Paris, where events will be held this week to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to the final rallies before the US midterm elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if this was the right time to meet with the Russian president.
"I'm not sure if I'll see you in Paris.
Probably not", noted the president of the United States.
However, the White House official added that they would meet at the G20 summit and "probably many times" after that.
Trump continues to try to "recharge" relations with Moscow despite allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Mr Strup appeals against the ECJ decision
Former director general of Vilnius University's Santará Clinic Kęstutis Strupas is asking the Supreme Commission for Ethics in the Service (VTEK) to annul the decision, which recognizes that the non-timely declaration of transactions violates the law.
Mr Strup's appeal was heard by the Vilnius District Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant seeks annulment of the decision of the VTEK of 23 May, BNS was informed by the court's spokesperson Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
Mr Strup believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, he claims, as an exception to the law.
In May, the ECA announced that the then-removed Director General of Santara Clinics, K. Strupas, and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Vilnius University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation revealed that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: a bank loan taken with the spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift of an apartment to the daughter in 2017 and a loan granted to a natural person together with the spouse in 1996 and not repaid.
Mr Strupieni also declared these transactions in default.
Persons who have violated the law on the reconciliation of public and private interests in the civil service may not be promoted for a year.
The law requires that you declare not only your personal data but also that of your spouse.
The investigation was carried out by the VTEK on the basis of information provided by Info TV.
It is unclear whether Mr Strupas and his wife, Ms Strupienė, head of the outpatient rehabilitation department at the Vilnius University Hospital, properly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year Mr Strup donated a property worth EUR 125,000 to his daughter.
However, the former head of the Santara Clinics and his wife did not mention these data in their declarations of interests.
The law enforcement agency has filed a complaint against K. Strup and at least 10 other individuals in a corruption investigation that it says is a fraudulent financial reward for the purchase of public computers and software from companies disguised as aid.
In this way, Mr Strup is suspected of having spoken at least five times during the IT procurement at Santara Clinics.
K. Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strup, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his position as head of the Santara Clinic in September.
The Ministry of Health and Vilnius University decided to terminate the working relationship with K. Strupes at the request of the participants of the Santara clinics.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
The Santaré clinics will continue to be managed on an interim basis by Professor Juozas Raistenskis, pending the competition for the appointment of a new director-general, which is expected to be announced later this year.
Congratulations of the Head of State on the anniversary of L. Gutausku
According to the head of state, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, opens the thousand-year wisdom and memory of the people into the whole of art.
The author's beloved and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testify to L. Gutauska's versatility as an award-winning artist.
On the occasion of the honorable anniversary, the President thanked the artist for his significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
Schools are starting to want to teach differently: they promise less tests, more practice
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in the content of education, which were presented at the forum "Change in educational content: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
Speaking at the discussion, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over 30 million euros had been invested in updating educational content over the past ten years, but no results were seen.
"According to the results of the PISA international student achievement survey, pupils' achievements are below the OECD average", said Minister of Education and Research Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the Ministry of Education and Research report, said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge rather than on applying it in practice.
According to him, Lithuania's general education programmes place a lot of emphasis on educating pupils in literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary to educate children in creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
The Deputy Minister of Education and Science, Gražvydas Kazakevičius, introduced the changes in the general content of education and said that the renewed programmes will be smaller, more specific and more interconnected.
According to the Deputy Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualised, schools will be more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare between 10 and 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of evaluating pupils will change to a cumulative score, greater weight will be given to the acquisition and informal competences of the pupil.
Small standardized tests.
The overall curriculum is promised to be digital, user-friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The aim of the content update is to improve pupil achievement in the international PISA by at least 10%, to reduce the gap between pupil achievement by a third, to improve pupils' current competences at school and to improve their writing skills in a variety of areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7,8 million from the European Union and state budgets to the updating of educational content from May 2018.
The project of the renewed general education programmes for the academic year 2019-2020 is expected to be piloted in some schools and to be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
The Ministry was criticised in early October for a nearly €8 million project by the Centre for the Development of Education to revamp the general programmes for primary, secondary and tertiary education.
The first procurement of EUR 1.3 million for training programme developers was announced at the beginning of October.
After experts criticized the purchase, it was suspended and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the Director of the Centre for Educational Development Giedrias Vaidel.
- Exercises in Lithuania to respond to extreme flooding
Lithuania will start a ten-day exercise on Monday to improve the institutional response to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (DFPR), the exercise will assess the readiness of the state authorities to respond to a national emergency such as a flood: to deal with its consequences, coordinate search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from the affected areas, organize their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and take other measures to protect the population.
The exercise will involve more than 100 representatives from all ministries, other institutions and the emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities.
From 5 to 13 November, the municipal authorities will conduct a preparatory exercise to decide on emergency management after receiving information from the PAGD on continuous rainfall and flooding.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for November 14-15.
The Department will operate a State Emergency Operations Centre, and the State and municipal institutions will operate institutional emergency operations centres.
Following the declaration by the Government of a state-level emergency due to the flooding, the operations manager appointed by the Prime Minister shall lead the emergency response, its consequences, protection and rescue of people and property.
The main objectives of the exercise, says Mindaugas Kanapickas, Deputy Director of the ADA, are to check the readiness of the authorities to perform the functions provided for by law, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check the readiness of the authorities to warn and inform the population, state and municipal authorities, institutions and enterprises of an impending disaster and to 'improve the emergency management skills of the public authorities'.
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capacity of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters and rescuers to pump large amounts of water from flooded areas.
The BaltFloodCombat module was established in 2009 for this purpose.
Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenko resigns
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation in a speech to the country's parliament on Tuesday, following the shock death of the bitterly anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, according to Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor General must submit a request for resignation to the President of Ukraine, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority vote.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenko presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the murder of K. Gandzuk to the Verkhovna Rada.
In his speech to parliament, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that Gandziuk's death was being used by politicians for public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke out against police corruption in her hometown of Kherson in southern Ukraine.
On 31 July, K. Gandziuk was spat acid in the face by an unknown assailant outside her home.
She died of her injuries in hospital on 4 November.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Ministry of Interior demand an answer on who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix
According to Lukashenko, the law enforcement investigation includes 12 individuals who may be linked to the order for the murder of Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, the leak provided the suspects with essential information.
He added that he knew Gandziuk personally and was outraged that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one can say that someone is clinging to power, I want to announce that I am resigning.
Today I will present it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss it in parliament", - quotes the publication Obzorrevatel from Lucenko's speech in the Council.
According to the report, Lucenko added that "two-state governance cannot be allowed in a country where the justice system is collapsing without any evidence, even for crimes that have been exposed".
He is considered to be a close associate of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following a protracted attempt to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, from office, suspected of covering up corruption among high-ranking officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Z. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As informed by the adviser to the Minister of Energy, Aurelija Vernickaitė, the meeting will focus on achieving the renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and beyond.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that is currently not on the overall trajectories set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, accounting for 6% of renewable energy in 2015.
The Commission considers that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken up the proposal to supplement the questions of the corruption investigation with the conservative appeals to the CPC
The Seimas approved a proposal on Tuesday after it was submitted, which was registered for an investigation into illegal influence on political processes by the head of the "state" Agnė Širinskienė.
58 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 27 voted against, and nine abstained.
The draft will then be considered by the Seimas committees, the main appointed by the Law and Order Committee headed by A. Širinskienė.
Following its conclusion, the amendment to the decision shall be put to the vote.
The temporary investigation commission of the Seimas, which is currently investigating a new political corruption case, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
A. Širinskienė proposed extending this deadline, stating that 'significant information about possible illegal influence and impact on political processes and state institutions has appeared in the public domain'.
The draft lists 'possible representation of pension funds' interests in the legislative process or by appeals to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of important independent bodies such as the Supreme Commission for Professional Ethics'.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "statesmen" found that the Conservatives relied heavily on the arguments of lawyers for private pension funds in their appeal.
Under the influence of the Supreme Commission of Ethics (SCE), the leaders of the "statists" accuse the former comrade Pavel Urbsh.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas State Administration and Municipalities Committee could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Section of the Commission, Mindaugas Siauri.
The Seimas set up a commission at the end of September to investigate possible unlawful influence by interested persons or groups of interested persons on the conduct of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, the work of individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and social movements, legislative processes, the election of heads of state-owned enterprises, public bodies, members of management or supervisory bodies, and the appointment of members.
It is also proposed to inquire what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities and how it has been responded to.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
The campaign for the presidential and European Parliament elections will take place at that time.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the 'foreigners'.
Two social workers, one 'orderly', one liberal and one representative of the Lithuanian Polish Electoral Action-Union of Christian Families were also appointed as members.
The Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants' and Greens' Union.
He claimed that the investigation of the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) conducted last session on essentially the same issues showed that the investigation should be continued.
The head of German internal intelligence has lost his post
The 55-year-old Maassen added to the controversy by blaming his troubles on "radical leftists" in Merkel's coalition.
As a result, he was not reassigned as promised but was forced to retire.
Among other things, it emerged last weekend that at a meeting of European domestic intelligence agencies in Warsaw a few weeks earlier, H.G. Maassen had criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a longtime defender of the head of intelligence, said at a press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointing".
Seehofer, himself under pressure both from this dispute and from his party's poor showing in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Steinmeier to release Maassen.
A shark attack has terrorized the island, killing a third person
The Queensland Emergency Service said that the victim suffered "serious leg and wrist injuries" in the attack near Sid Harbor on Sequoia Island, off the Queensland coast.
The man was taken to the hospital by helicopter.
The island of Sekminy is the largest of the islands in the archipelago of the same name, attracting many scuba divers and surfers from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have been relatively rare so far.
On September 19th, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day, a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last shark attack before the most recent was on this island in 2010.
The JRC has two new members, Viscount and Pous
A. Pus was nominated as a member of the JCC by the Lithuanian Bar Association.
He will replace Svajona Šaltauskienna, a delegate of the Lawyers' Association who has resigned from the Supreme Court.
Judge E. Viskont was nominated as a member of the Supreme Council on the basis of the party's nomination.
This party has no representative in the CEC since Donat Laurinavičius left.
During the secret ballot, 74 members of the Seimas supported the candidacy of A. Puksa, 5 were against, 6 abstained.

Big Girls Break the Stereotypes of Wedding Dresses
A full-bodied girl with a white blush on her wedding dress - mission impossible?
Can a white buffalo swimming to the altar be larger than an S or M and still look attractive?
The contestants of the reality show "The Evolution of the Great (r) " will prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride really does not depend on the weight of the woman.
And that's not all - one of the project girls will be crying tears of joy tonight - her boyfriend will be on set.
"Some people feel that older girls don't get the attention or looks of boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me for who I am, he doesn't expect me to be a standard figure", - Aurika, a talk show participant, before her wedding dress appearance.
A wedding dress is not light, in every sense, a dress is a complex construction, it has a lot of material, the dress is heavy, uncomfortable to move.
Also, some women feel that a larger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and thus have less self-confidence.
I can reassure you that a well-chosen dress model really solves this 'problem,'" explained Robert Kalinkin, a member of the jury and a fashion designer.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by Kalinkinas together with the entire commission - plus size fashion house founder Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social media star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"There is a lot of debate among the judges about who should leave the show - we all come from different backgrounds and have different ideas about who should win.
The challenge of showing the wedding dresses was made even more difficult by the fact that, I can now say, there were two new ones that were no worse than the old ones.
It was a special evening in every way", says Kalinkinen.
The newcomers - Eve, 23, famous for her scandalous behavior on a summer reality show, and Doville, 31, a beautiful mother of two - were selected as the other girls in the "Great Evolution" competition and made it to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl was brought back to the show by the NLC audience, who voted for their favorite on the TV portal.
The internationally recognized reality show of bodybuilding beauties in Lithuania is running for the second week - here plus-size girls compete for the title of the first plus-size star in the country.
So far, only eight have been selected, and they all know that only one will win.
The intriguing and unpredictable week of the reality show "The Evolution of Big (r) " begins this Monday night at 8:30 p.m. on NBC.
Actor Elba named sexiest man alive
People magazine named this year's sexiest man alive.
The 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba was named.
Although the man claims that the news was a surprise when he spoke about the new title, he was not being humorous.
I thought, "No way!
Are you serious?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, "Yeah, I look sexy today", and the actor laughed.
To be honest, Idris said that the title was a very pleasant feeling that had been a source of pride for him.
The British star claims that he was often abused and bullied, which made his childhood difficult because, as he describes it, he was "very tall and clumsy".
The young actor was disliked and bullied by his peers, both because of his rare and unusual name and his African background.
"I grew a mustache and a muscle and became the toughest guy in my neighborhood", says Idris with a smile.
When he's not proud of his screen credentials, Elba works as a disc jockey at parties in Spain, especially in bustling Ibiza.
In his spare time, the man enjoys Thai boxing and has a fashion sense that he develops through his own clothing line.
The British actor says his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans to marry his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba was voted the 33rd sexiest man alive by People magazine.
In 2017, the title went to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during drunken driving in the Shihrwin area
A man was beaten to death during a drinking party in the village of Shalkiški in the district of Širvinyts on Monday evening.
According to the Vilnius police, at 9:16 p.m., a report was received that a man beat up a neighbor while drinking.
When the doctors arrived, they found a man born in 1943 dead.
We have a suspect in custody, born in 1994, with a B.E.R. of 2.53.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
No longer 20 km distance required by managers when building waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built near the Gariun market.
The authorities no longer want to build incinerators within 20 kilometers of settlements.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Act in the Seimas on Monday, which waives such a requirement.
The amendment, which was rejected by the Green Group, has been supported by the Green Group, which had previously supported the 20 km distance provision.
The amendment of the Minimum Wage provides that as of January 2019 incineration plants can be built to meet statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the President's concerns about such a ban.
"Given the definition of a residential area, it is clear that it would be almost impossible to find a site suitable for the above-mentioned facilities", says the chairman of the committee.
The ruling majority in October opposed a presidential veto amendment to tighten construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to prohibiting the construction of waste incineration plants within 20 km of settlements, the amendments allowed the government to make decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interests.
Mr Mažeika does not propose to amend the latter provisions.
The waste and biofuel power plant is being built in Vilnius by the energy group "Lietuvos energija" and in Kaunas by Fortum Heat Lietuva, a Finnish energy group.
The latter is already incinerating waste in Klaipeda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in Brexit negotiations
The leaders of the United Kingdom and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday to resolve the difficult issue of Northern Ireland that has stalled Brexit negotiations, Dublin reported.
In a telephone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possibility of reviewing the so-called backstop mechanism to keep the border between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland province and the European Union's Republic of Ireland open.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has promised to consider the proposal but has rejected any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, Mrs May 'brought up the possibility of reviewing the mechanism for hedging', it says.
'The Minister has indicated that he is open to reviewing new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to withdraw the hedging arrangements,' the government statement said.
Brexit negotiators cannot find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
The two sides agree on 'protective measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open pending the signing of a wider trade agreement, to ensure that no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking to see Britain unilaterally withdraw from the backstop deal within three months.
But Mr Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
'Three-month or fixed-term hedges are not worth the paper they will be written on,' he said.
London and Brussels have not confirmed a breakthrough in Brexit talks after reports that a deal was on the table in Britain over the weekend.
"I would say we are still making progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done", said Mrs May's spokesman in London.
European Commission spokeswoman Margaritis Schin also told reporters: 'We are not there yet.'
Nobel laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, and the Nobel Prize-winning writer Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We call on leaders of goodwill on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, where citizens can make decisions based on facts", the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global information and communication space" is a common good that "must be protected to enhance freedom of expression and opinion".
'People have a fundamental right to information that is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on a commitment to truth, the principles of pluralism of approaches and rational methods of fact-finding,' the declaration added.
The document calls for help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who has often criticized "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting the facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they gather at the Peace Forum in Paris from 11 to 13 November, the signatories urged.
The declaration was prepared over a period of two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deloire), head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based organisation for freedom of the press and the rights of journalists.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama.
Seimas approves higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide for increased fines for product safety violations.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As stated by Antanas Vinkus, Member of the Seimas Committee on Health, the new draft is welcome in that the targets set are related to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions shall be adapted to the requirements of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
'My view is that the proposed law is more precisely and specifically distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: producers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as the persons who have paid the fines continue to repeat infringements,' said A. Vinkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy and, after the approval of the Government, supplemented by the Seimas Economic Committee with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim to increase fines for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, empower market surveillance authorities and create a clear system for monitoring product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Economy, at present there is no obligation for producers to properly label the product to ensure its traceability.
Moreover, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities are not granted access to the premises, buildings and inspections of manufacturers and suppliers during the State product safety control, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The Ministry considers that the six-month period for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to establish, investigate and impose a fine.
The Ministry also considered that the fines imposed were not sufficiently effective.
Companies frequently repeatedly breach the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so in 2017 alone.
The Ministry of Economy proposed to impose an obligation on producers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the identification of non-compliant suppliers by market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to grant market surveillance authorities the right to enter the premises, buildings and premises of operators who produce or place products on the market and to carry out inspections in the context of national product safety controls.
The fines for violations of the law are to be increased.
A fine of between EUR 150 and 2 500 (currently between EUR 144 and EUR 1 448) would be imposed on a manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous products on the market and on a distributor, who places them on the market, who provides or provides dangerous services.
The State Consumer Protection Agency (SPCA) or another market surveillance authority would impose a fine of between EUR 1 000 and 5 000 (currently between 868 and 4 344) on a decision to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products cause harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products cause the death of a consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (currently between EUR 5 792 and EUR 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, infringements of product safety legislation are subject to fines of up to EUR 25 000 in Poland and Austria (minimum fine not fixed), between EUR 26 000 and EUR 600 000 in Belgium, between EUR 155 and EUR 6 666 in Romania and between EUR 125 and EUR 7 500 in Bulgaria.
10-year-old has a baby: raped by a family member
The events in Colombia shocked millions.
A 10-year-old girl who was raped by her older brother gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby was delivered by Caesarean section, but both the girl and her baby are doing fine.
They were under medical care for a while.
It will be some time before the young mother and baby are released home.

Police are investigating a rape and child abuse incident.
The Norwegian Armed Forces Battalion took part in NATO exercises in the most remote and harshest areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces took part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital, Oslo.
This is part of NATO's Triple Engagement 2018 exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the 2nd battalion of the Norwegian army after the terrorist attacks of September 11 spent a lot of time away from home, in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries.
But they are best suited to warfare in Arctic conditions, and their skills are particularly useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tyneside, often in the most remote and harshest areas, soldiers have been engaged in staged battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wilderness, but in the harsh climate they have to carry much more weight - about 50 kilograms [50 lb] per backpack.
The soldiers in the headquarters say that they share their skills in surviving and fighting in these conditions with other NATO soldiers.
Soldiers say that this exercise, which is more reminiscent of actual warfare than any other, will teach them to be prepared in the event of a serious threat.

However, the hosts kept the lead and prevented Fulham from being knocked out.
The only goal of the match was scored by T. Fosu-Mensah in the 29th minute.

Kaunas deputy does not plan to return to politics after his resignation
Former Kaunas vice-mayor Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the organization "Vieningo Kauno" to support Vygaud Ušacka in the presidential elections, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to focus on business.
I'm a shareholder in a few companies, and I have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family", said Mr Mačiulis.
He also said he had no plans to contest the upcoming municipal elections.
Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with Ušacku after losing the primary election of the Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrida Šimonytei on Sunday.
"To be honest, we haven't had a chance to discuss the results and plans with him and the team.
It is obvious that with Vygaudou's withdrawal from the further electoral campaign, this stage of my life is over", said Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave Kaunas politics in favour of Mr Ushack, only regretted that 'Lithuania lost a unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations'.
Mačiulis served briefly as deputy mayor of Kaunas in 2011, and then returned to these positions after the successful election of the United Kaunas in 2015.
He is a shareholder in the Erudito Lyceum, a private school, and in several other companies.
The workers in Kaunas castle are fleecing. What are they doing here?
After observing the workers at Kaunas Castle, the inhabitants hoped that the work on the remaining tower would finally begin.
The director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrielius Sužiedelis, told the Kaunas.info website that the southwest tower with a fragment of the defensive wall is undergoing a roof replacement.
The interviewer said the roofs would be canned.
"The emergency worn-out canister cover posed a danger to others - people could fall and be injured - and it had to be replaced.
The glass ceiling was no longer moisture-resistant, and so was the heritage", explained the museum director.
Will these roofs look like they did a few centuries ago?
'All the work is in coordination with the heritage and other institutions,' added Mr Verweer, adding that the aim was to make the result as authentic as possible, but that there was also an important practical side to it: the roofs had to protect the values from moisture.
A universal solution is chosen when working with heritage.
Before that, the Kaunas Castle's elements were covered in the Soviet era, so they no longer had historical value", said the director of the Kaunas City Museum.
The employment contract was signed on 2 October.
The works are expected to last no longer than three months from the date of signing of the contract.
"It is expected to be finished by the end of November", the museum director said.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost EUR 24 000.
This amount, according to the interviewee, was provided for in this year's budget.
The works at Kaunas Castle are carried out by the company "Statija".
Kaunas. dag.lt has written that according to research, Kaunas Castle may have looked earlier.
The United States and South Korea have resumed naval exercises
A naval exercise with about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang for two weeks, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military exercises for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocations" and "preparations for invasion".
On Friday, North Korea threatened to resume its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course could be "seriously considered", said the North's foreign ministry.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that the sanctions would remain in place until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he would meet North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.
Maxima expands in Bulgaria - Business news

Maxima Bulgaria's CEO Edwin Volks told the business magazine Capital that the company will open two more new stores by the end of this year, bringing the total to 74 in the country.
Next year, Volko said, seven to 10 more stores are planned in Bulgaria.
The company recently opened a new concept store in Sofia, T-Market Express, in which it invested EUR 1 million.
It has a 24-hour "social zone" where you can access the Internet for free, charge your smartphone, and buy sandwiches, salads, and other foods.
According to Volko, 2018 will be the first year in which the company will end with a positive EBITDA.
Mr Volks forecasts that Maxima Bulgaria's revenue will increase by 40% this year to EUR 158,5 million.
Last year, the company generated revenue of EUR 113.3 million.
The Maxima Group has been operating in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company entered the top 10 largest retail chains in the country for the first time.
The Maxima Group, managed by the Vilniaus prekybos group controlled by Nerijaus Numavičius, intends to invest around EUR 200 million this year and next, mainly in Poland, where Maxima has acquired the Stockrotka retail chain.
The group operates the retail chains Maxim and the e-food store Barbora in the Baltic States and the Polish stores Stokrotka and Aldik.
The Commission notes that the restructuring plan was approved by the Commission on the basis of the information provided by the Belgian authorities.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies will collaborate with two leading US think tanks
According to Lin Kojala, head of RESC based in Vilnius and with 13 years of experience, the establishment in the USA will allow projects to be implemented and will make Lithuania's voice heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working on this for months.
I am pleased that two large institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I am sure that there will be niche activities, because the topics we are analysing, NATO, security, disinformation, development of the Eastern Partnership countries, are also priorities for them,' said Kojala.
The agreements provide for the RESC and the US authorities to work together on the preparation of international project applications, exchange of expertise and expertise, and expert visits.
This should be particularly beneficial for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have excellent international reputations.
The FPRI has been in existence since 1955 and brings together almost 100 top-level analysts.
In the latest ranking of the world's analytical centers by the University of Pennsylvania, the FPRI was ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work with the highest US political institutions on numerous occasions, is ranked 10th in its category.
"This will give Lithuanian analysts from different institutions more opportunities to break into the US information space and will encourage us to raise the bar", added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be the partners' help in the dissemination of the forthcoming Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review, an analytical publication of the RESC, among US decision-makers and the public.
The Centre for East European Studies shall operate on a project-by-project basis and shall not be supported by targeted grants.
The RESC partners with whom the Joint Initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseilles
Two people were slightly injured when two buildings collapsed in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
As the buildings collapsed, debris facing the street lifted up.
Dozens of firefighters, some with trained dogs, were working at the scene, near the famous old port of Marseilles.
The local prefecture posted on Twitter pictures showing a pile of debris and wood chips, a huge gap in the area where the buildings stood, firefighters working on the scene and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they were looking for people who might have been trapped under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
A pilot video shown by BFM-TV shows dust clouds in the street and handcuffs covering the mouths of passersby.
Google Street View photos taken before the incident show that one of the collapsed buildings was five stories high and the other six stories high.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with window blinds and large cracks in the facade.
The mayor of the Marseille district, Sabine Bernasconi, said one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to be evacuated.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used by people who had been living there arbitrarily.
The regional prefecture urged people to avoid the area and clear roads for rescue services.
The mayor of the Marseille district Sabine Bernascon said the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.

Mexican restaurant helps migrants deported from the U.S.
The more the Mexicans are deported, the harder they are to adjust.
"When I was deported, they took everything from me - my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything but one thing - my knowledge", says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's manager.
The restaurant's board hopes that the blending of Mexican and American cultures will promote better understanding.
An Afghan Special Forces member shot an American instructor during a training exercise.
North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, 39-year-old Brent Taylor, mayor of the city, had taken a year's leave of absence to serve a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer with the Joint Forces Headquarters, but was due to return to the mayor's job in January.
Another unnamed member of the U.S. military was wounded in the attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
Officials say Mr. Taylor died from infantry gunfire.
Major General Jefferson S. Burton, commander of the Utah National Guard, told reporters that Taylor had helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army.
The UTA cited a NATO report that Taylor was shot by a trained special forces soldier and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are scheduled to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Monday night.
He's served two tours in Iraq, and this one in Afghanistan was his second.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisers and instructors for a special forces battalion in that country.
Just yesterday, hundreds of North Ogden residents took to the streets of the city of about 17,000 to march with their mayor and his family in a police procession.
Mr. Taylor became mayor in 2013.
