The C.S.S.D. in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or the bakery.
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers so that the members of the Prague City Council and the City Council can understand their new SDG colleagues.
Aktuálně.cz "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the marked slang language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The codified dictionary that used the flower and cream of Prague politics during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the metropolis' best-known characters, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councillors hardly understand these familiar concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know".
"I'm rather a novice in Prague politics", said culture councillor Lukáš Kaucký during the terminology exam for "college".
And as for the veteran politician, Karel Březina reacted the same way.
You may be familiar with the concept of a golf hole.
"It's probably the only expression of all the ones you've asked me to use from time to time".
"Otherwise, I don't usually use slang".
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by Aktuálně.cz last June ahead of the ODS voting congress, the editorial staff selected six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's largest golf hole", "going to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "treason of the capital" and "armor".
Three councillors agreed to take the test and a fourth, Antonín Weinert, who will be in charge of education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so outright.
"I don't get into this stuff or value how civic democrats have fun".
"What really matters to me is how we will understand each other in the implementation of our programmes", he said.
As we have seen, councilman Lukáš Kaucký would not have realized that the above title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of former Bém mayor Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" means nothing to Kaucký; the only term he got right on the exam is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel", says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know it from the news".
"I'm going to have to sign up for a language course", he jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the councillor for the Environment Lukáš Plachý.
Afterwards, both social democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukáš Plachy even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think he means going to a Prague company"; it is soon revealed to Plachy that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
Like Březina, he indicates that he got such knowledge from the news, but that he does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms exists among the social democrats.
"I asked my classmates, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything in common".
"Rather, we use nicknames among ourselves, sometimes abbreviations or word games with names", says Prague's ČSSD president Petr Hulínský, whose party colleagues call her Hulda.
"At school they called me Bříza, but I don't know if my peers call me that too", confesses Karel Březina, who goes by his own nickname.
Aktuálně.cz tried the name and it works.
For his party colleagues, Weinert is Děda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they were associated before the election cheats during the party sponsorship, receives the nickname "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of his colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that the Social Democrats tolerate in party speech.
Hulínský does not like to be called Hulda, but the newspaper Aktuálně.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The Doctor of the rights of the batons" apparently recalls that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctorate in law at the Bratislava police academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", according to a brochure
Women considered witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, unmarried and childless.
Women who "become" witches are sent to an isolated area, so they don't harm the rest of the village.
"Men seldom suffer such a fate".
"Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help out with chores and have children", explains a nun who, in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, works in a special home for more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued a pamphlet that should help prevent the witch hunt.
This has a catch, though.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso are illiterate", warns the newspaper Die Standard of the disadvantages of written awareness-raising.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemmah, 72, died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news came out on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman caught on to the oil used for ritual anointings.
She caught fire when the group wanted to "cast out the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "Soul-eaters have always been a danger".
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to pacify the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president was still involved.
"Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a widespread witch hunt that allegedly had been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself by black magic".
"To help him, he brought in shamans from neighbouring Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president's personal escort, forcibly took men and women chosen at random from Gambian villages to the president's property in Kanilai", Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the estate.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
The tenant of Bakala: heats himself with coal stoves and signs a higher rent
The elderly, shy man walked through the doors of the customer service center of the RPG Byty company of "coal magnate" Zdeňek Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story lease agreements: his, his daughter's and his son's, who is serving his sentence.
The three of them just got caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with a second-class separate kitchen from next year.
"Moreover, there is no hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler", the man points to his son's new contract, over whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it", he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, when it will publish a guide informing how to proceed in these cases.
But man only makes a nod.
"Each one says something", he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a great testing ground for liberalisation.
After New Year's it will happen with the vast majority of the flats which, in the Czech Republic, were until now under a regulated lease.
That is why Aktuálně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG Mining Waiting Room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a number-taking machine.
"Rental 2011", can be read on a bright button on your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out.
He barely has time to read "157" and the number is already displayed on the large screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple comes to ask, but the crowd in the hall isn't here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve usual problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
Letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 apartments belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the letters an increase in the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On 18 November a special window opens at the customer service centre for new rentals.
"It's been running for a week, so it's starting", responds the workers who are in it when the customer introduces himself as a journalist.
Liberalisation and the former Bakala miners' flats are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already being discussed loud and clear by the deputy speaker of the Ostrava-based Parliament, Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, and now they appear continuously in the local newspapers.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor".
"They didn't even change my fucking bathroom dish", ventures the man mentioned in the introduction.
According to the workers, they are mostly retired people who come to see if they get a discount on rent if they sign on time, as promised by the RPG special offer.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before 15 December will also receive half of the discount on the February rent.
However, the window of "liberalisation" of mining certainly fails to dispel the flood of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked for rent in 2011", estimates the window attendant.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and in its boards to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the parties cannot reach an agreement on the rent, an independent judge must decide the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely lawful way forward", warns RPG on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here", says one of RPG Byty's employees and a man standing in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the right answer.
"I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left over for food; I have no means to go to court", he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see about that".
"Mr. Zaorálek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait", he thinks.
Rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rents still do not even cover the amounts needed to maintain the community fund", recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the residential portfolio of the RPG Byty company, who adds that the neglected state of the community fund that angers tenants is, for the owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest four billion in apartments with rent, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.200 million.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data highlighted in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG properties".
"In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per month per square meter", the screen says.
Just increased by 38% the rent of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter", indicates RPG.
At 2,600 floors, rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that the liberalization will not affect rents all at once, but will be scaled up over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rent increase (see graph) back into the flats, mainly in savings on heating: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to those who sign the rent increase agreement.
The architects have understood that the offices also need daycare.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would think that it also contains a small nursery with all the features of such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio produced numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-garage.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly in the baby boom age and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of reduced working hours, the daycare is one of the benefits that Arch.Design offers its workers as part of its social programme.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility of combining a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-nursery was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's mini-garden is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
The financing granted (more than CZK 2.8 million) enabled them to purchase the equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified personnel and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design is obliged to keep the mini-nursery running with its own funds for three years.
The project was prepared over a year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the financing application.
The children are cared for by qualified staff, and a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are available round the clock.The nursery currently accommodates children of no age limit, although most of them are under three years of age.
As it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can accommodate only a maximum of five children at a time, although more children attend during the day as the shifts increase.
The operation of the day care centre is flexible to suit the needs of the parents and the children of all workers have the same right to use the day care centre, irrespective of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten programme are comparable to the programme of the regular preschool.
The children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, including English.
The classroom has not only toys and board games, but also a computer for the children.
The presence of young children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can visit their children at any time and avoid the stress of picking up the children late from school when away from work.
This way, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Arch.Design is thus among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this programme reinforced staff marketing.
The House of Bones is still fascinating after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs look like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batlló, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its skeleton-like shape, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, striking colors, the novel use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and the omnipresent smoothly curved lines, all are typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The house's cover plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures drawn from nature and wildlife.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way as to enhance the brightness of the colors.
The serpentine and twisted forms continue to amaze us even inside.
Wavy wood imitates window frames, railings, doorway ornaments, gazebos, and signs.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample neighbourhood at number 43 of the lively Passeig de Grácia shopping street, was born from the remodeling of a house built in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on tearing down the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló, made up of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated on the design.
In fact, in his project plans emerged ornaments for the apartment representative of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the facade.
Other creators and artists also worked on the facade.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Casa Batlló was the beginning of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Casa Milá and the Güell Park of Gaudí, in which other pieces of it are located.
Because of its organic shape, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, because of the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began calling it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the time with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may seem strange to have a forty-five degree inclination.
During construction, Gaudí did not respect the building codes of the time and did not let himself be influenced by them.
Nevertheless, the construction obtained the corresponding permit from the beginning, although evidently the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the city council was so shocked with the result that it asked to be corrected.
He was upset, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
The arrangements were never made, rather the opposite: just fifteen days after the request of the city council, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself settled down on the lower floors.
The second floor had the living room and the third floor had the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the living rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without any problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with Gaudí's reconstruction, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, the white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The two-color game brings maximum light to all floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit the Casa Batlló, which in 2005 was added to the Unesco World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most charged of the publicly accessible apartments.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The visits confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very profitable business and expanded the visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the roof terrace.
The price of admission to the monument is not insignificant, reaching 16,50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of entry for other Gaudí constructions in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real bed atmosphere with its lizard towers, you should quickly befriend some resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose a mattress and a pillowcase: women and men look for different things
Not a pompous bed frame; what really gives a good bed its quality is the surface on which to lie down, that is, the mattress and the pillow.
First of all, they must be perfectly complementary so that they are adapted to the specific users.
Numerous factors come into play during the selection process, including the weight, height, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and the shroud are located is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cottage that is not usually heated, latex mattresses should not be used because they "heat up" more slowly.
In addition, they are usually considerably heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is therefore necessary to turn them over more frequently.
If the central channels are not properly ventilated and are on a firm base above, they keep moisture in, and mold may even appear underneath.
When choosing a bed, customs also influence.
Anyone who has spent a lot of time abroad often uses a very high mattress with a soft coating and will have trouble feeling comfortable on a lower, harder surface.
"Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep as well here".
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic".
"This type of mattress is also recommended for people with diabetes who have nervous system problems, so they receive bad information from the joints and skin", explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in padded furniture.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, have long preferred viscoelastic mattresses.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico".
You don't have to be an NHL player to appreciate viscoelasticity.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape depending on the heat absorbed or adapts to its body heat.
Nothing puts pressure on you; at night, you won't be spinning like after a hard game.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also acts as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman who is about 180 cm tall will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for one person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, 180 cm in total.
In the case of single rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So a possible visit would also be comfortable.
"If not, a simple rule for calculating the width can be applied: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to your elbows", advises engineer Helena Prokopová, an expert at Cechu čalouníků a dekoratérů, who has been working for many years on the subject of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a subject she teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each needs its own bed and mattress, so during the purchase care must be taken to match the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, the beds will need to be mounted at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, models with springs inside at least 15 cm, of which at least three centimetres are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softens.
"When touching it with your hand or when sitting on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the springs", warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of shade.
Fully padded bedrooms, where the mattress and base are like Siamese, don't make sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe badly and cannot be washed, which is often the case today.
And since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat each night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) sieve.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that talk of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
So the sellers advise: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 centimeters wide, take care to clean and wash the cover, but better add a mattress protector that can be removed and easily washed.
Although mattress covers are now made with zippered closures all around, opening them into two parts (very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), handling them on larger models (and by one person) when lifting the mattress may seem like a fight between a flyweight and a heavyweight.
In bed, instead of a somier, do you have a firm board?
I never will!
So much for beds made for overnight guests.
However, you must make (if you do not already have) ventilation holes in the board and it must be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with the springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft coating.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointed sheet-mattresses containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although it is always preferable to use a sheet-mattresses with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the sheets of the lumbar region are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
The jointed sheet-mattress should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
This is a special fixture of the blades that allows the blades to be pressed or even tilted so that they "circle" the shoulders perfectly during sleep.
For men with very wide shoulders, this is something very important.
Even mattress manufacturers remember them, and in the "male" category, they began to use a softer area around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are cross- or panel-shaped cushions with the so-called multitorsion cushioning.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
You should also bear in mind that even if you use the right mattress and pillow, if you use a bad pillow (large and "moulded"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
The recommended appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder-reinforced pillow or the softer area of the mattress) as the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to do, it seems, with the original straw-filled mattresses.
Manufacturers are still increasingly using natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, organic mattresses are in fashion.
The petroleum-based raw materials used to make polyurethane foam are filled with natural oils, such as castor oil or soybean oil.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biological, in the case of mattresses, means that the centre is made exclusively of natural materials", explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattress linings, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh forest or lavender aroma.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "cool" themselves with vegetable extracts from breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "warm" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so women feel warmer.
The current favourites?
Mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offers more permeability.
The combination of various cold foam and viscoelastic rigidities makes it possible to make mattresses of different areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you from seven thousand crowns upwards.
Those with a therapeutic function are usually subject to a lower VAT rate, since they are considered as healthcare.
The first to obtain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's hard to save on mattresses and bed linens.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 kroner.
The second one is free.
The era of viscoelasticity with an open cell structure and high density began with the "cosmic" material of Tempur.
It was originally developed as a NASA material, because during takeoffs astronauts were subjected to enormous overload.
Tempur softened with heat and hardened with cold.
Thus, the human body, when warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal for preventing wounds, but also for improving sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foam is used not only in mattresses but also in sanitary products, for example, pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
The national manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and the like.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to monitor their children
Fear for children is leading more and more people to think about GPS monitoring.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and contribute to cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old girl Anička Janatková.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but soon it will be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were scared by the case of the missing Anička and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not spying, but another way to reduce the chances of a tragedy", says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I recognize that in certain cases such devices can be abused, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet encountered such cases".
"Most customers actually buy it for safety reasons", adds Pilin.
In his opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bochková warns that if the child does not want to take it, he will simply throw it away.
"Even young children are very creative about intentionally losing things if they want to avoid being controlled".
"Before, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device", says Bočková.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a premeditated kidnapping, the perpetrator will almost always check to see if the child is carrying any electronic device that can reveal his location".
"Now it's the phone".
"As the use of tracking devices spreads, you will also look for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be highly advertised".
"In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police", says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the event of an impromptu attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after an attack, their presence can help.
'The device can be configured to regularly transmit the position after a certain period.'
"If it is damaged, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person in question".
"The most expensive devices have a tiltmeter built in, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question", Čech says.
In its view, such a service can be obtained even with mobile smartphones with navigation, which only need to be equipped with special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices with a size similar to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
So you can get lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that resemble a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added benefit that a potential assailant may not identify the device".
"Or to identify it after a certain time, which can save the police time", he adds.
Although the tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will still use the same technology as used for vehicle tracking.
This is the verification of position with a GPS system (used in normal car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough machetes to surround the whole of the Czech Republic, but they only last two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to ignite explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of wick to its arsenal.
So, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the wick is two years, four at most.
The army bought the explosives wick from STV Group, a.s. for forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha by saying that the soldiers need for training maneuvers 60 kilometers of mecha per year.
According to the calculations of the army's pyrotechnics, with whom MF DNES was in contact, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, they should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-command officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions either, Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and Army Captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way could the army be justified in spending sixty kilometres of machete.
That length is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if it were, the army would have enough supplies for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional comes with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even shooting practices are limited for money.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also cannot understand why we are repeatedly bought such quantities of mecha".
"But it's your choice, and you will no doubt know why you act this way".
"For us, the military is a good customer, and as a company we try to satisfy them", admits Jan Děcký, commercial director of STV Group.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of kilometers of mecha saying he will also have stocks of this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of STV Group points out that the wick has a useful life of only four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, two years.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four", says one soldier who, because of possible criticism from the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its useful life, each round must be carefully checked to see if it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument from the Ministry is that, by buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"They cost us 60% less than last year's order of 244 kilometers", said Pejšek, spokesman for the Defense Ministry's procurement center.
Just to compare: the annual consumption of wick by the police pyrotechnics, who dispose of the ammunition of the Second World War or that left by the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for years.
Furthermore, the police always ask for just the right amount to run out of ammunition before it is out of stock.
They decided to do so for safety reasons for the pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable wick types can be obtained.
The Ministry is already having difficulty finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact era, when the Czechoslovak army of 200,000 was preparing for a campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will occur with the current one: hundreds of kilometres of old mecha will have to be removed, which is now being bought "cheaply".
I still live off the contacts I made through the contest.
The fact that he won the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of his hotel franchises.
The last edition, the "Entrepreneur of the Year" contest was won by 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story seems to be taken from a movie.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
While abroad, he realized that there was a need for quality accommodation at a good price in Liberec.
With the savings he had accumulated from seasonal jobs abroad and a bank loan, he bought a half-destroyed five-story house.
Considering that he was still in his third year of college, he was really brave.
"The value of accommodation in our area has now made me want to do something about it", says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started renting the first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned he reinvested in the building, which gradually became a 54-room boarding house.
Since then, in seven years in business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guesthouses, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year he opened another of the same quality.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise", said the number one entrepreneur last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licences was helped in no small part by the fact that we won the 'Entrepreneur of the Year' competition", Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased his fame and popularity both in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice", he recalls.
He certainly recommends anyone who wants to try out any of the companies that are in the competition.
But he believes that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, until now, he continues to live off contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"I've started to collaborate regularly with some people I met through the contest".
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
In total, there are about 70.
"I've seen them show greater loyalty and are proud to be part of something that has gained general recognition".
"It is not, by any means, my own personal success, but it is the result of the hard work of the whole team".
"Only my name appears on the front page", says Lukáš Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a calmer year than we've had at Farmet.
The euphoria for victory was soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already been through the worst.
The owner of the Farmet company, Karel Žďárský, won first prize in the last edition of Vodafone's "Company of the Year" contest, last year at the "Slavic House" in Prague.
The jury appreciated his efforts, which enabled him to turn a small technical workshop in Česká Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
"I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight the competition", says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet began with the desire to make something useful.
So when the state offered Karel Žďárský's father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the seizure of property during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialist public after achieving success in the media competition.
"Not only did our customers start to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but foreign partners also started to value working with a company that had more success in their country", says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, perhaps, was not at Farmet just a display of the euphoria of victory.
It also received recognition for its commercial results up to 2008 and partially 2009.
And 2009 was the toughest year for selling machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machinery or technology.
"We obviously didn't get out of that either".
"Revenue fell by 40%, we had to limit production and even had some layoffs", explains Karel Žďárský.
A viable company must sometimes take even unpopular measures.
However, they kept the situation under control and maintained the company's profits, albeit at lower levels than before the crisis.
However, where Farmet did not cut spending was in research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened our presence on the international market and obtained excellent evaluations at national fairs", says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that they have left the crisis behind.
Revenues rise again and with them the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere", notes Karel Žďárský.
A survey that reveals ridiculous standards
The Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He's already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than a third of the nearly four thousand voters.
For example, the social security administration would ask for an extract from the trade register, although its officials can get it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the poll, that's changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the commercial register when it checks the taxation of the insured", declared ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The aim of the "Absurdity of the Year" survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of the business competition of the Hospodářské noviny publication and is also starting to attract interest among the general public.
While last year's edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it has practically reached four thousand.
And this is not surprising, since we still have several extra legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"We are perhaps the world's number one in terms of paperwork required for tax returns", says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated objective of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of conditions for business, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2006 and is repeated every year in the same way.
Anyone can point to some administrative or bureaucratic nonsense every year between April and the end of September, when the contest closes.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. The organiser of the competition then selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The nonsense that gets the most votes wins.
For this year's survey, more than 100 were submitted, including 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by businessmen, professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for road and motorway maintenance pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of 70 proposals for this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held in early November at Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of an event in which political and social figures usually participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State continuously impedes entrepreneurs, so my aim is to eliminate every year at least 30 paragraphs that currently unnecessarily complicate trade", announced Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not put on hold.
In 2007, what most disturbed people was the obligation of the entrepreneur to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was abolished in the new industrial law.
The obligation that finished second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the notification to the employment office by its foreign workers of work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third one wins.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales in their office.
So this year the Ministry of Health issued a statement saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognises socially responsible enterprises
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are valued.
The fifth edition of the Hospodářské noviny competition is a new category called Responsible Enterprise of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to support responsible and fair companies.
"We want to support companies that care about the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator Vodafone, organiser and sponsor of the contest, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year contest.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone's main competition for 2010 Enterprise, companies were presented for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
Each one's story is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely from one to another, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In some cases, this is the case for disabled people, in others for personal problems or for the health of employees.
Among the 14 finalists from across the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the training of informal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubice area is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to support disabled children for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper mill which is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up over 70% of the workforce; for this reason it was awarded the title of the Central Czech Enterprise and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it finished third in the region.
In Olomouc, accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, reducing working hours to below the average of 35 hours a week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded to them because they buy first from Czech manufacturers, support Community activities in the area and respect the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities have the least possible impact on the environment", explains entrepreneur Miluše Ryznarová.
IT company Enlogit from Ústí also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports working from home and uses the catering services of a local protected company at its business events.
"We also support the 'Persona in need' grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community", says Ondřej Suchý, a representative of the company.
The laundry company Praní a čištění in the Karlovy Vary region is also well placed with a mention, whose employees receive special bonuses that affect their pension funds.
"We give out benefits in food, transport, skills upgrading and leisure", says Josef Strapáč of the winning construction company Bruntál Czasch in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the category of Responsible Company of the Year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest who answered the questions on the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August were automatically designated.
The organisers removed from the evaluation forms which were incomplete or incorrect.
'If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Competition for Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year.'
"Individual applications for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Enterprise of the Year competition", explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police made arrests during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police made several arrests in the building of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
Detectives handcuffed a local media businessman and real estate developer Luboš G.
It appears that this is an attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights so that the auctioned land would be given to a specific interested party.
I was to pay Luboš G. half a million crowns for it.
"At the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender", said the head of the general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that at the moment he cannot divulge more details about the ongoing investigation.
After 24 hours, the police released the 46-year-old businessman.
How he could influence the public auction, given the limited official information, can only be speculated.
The spokeswoman for the Agricultural Fund Lubomíra Černá answered Právo's questions by saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and it was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our employees", he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called 'Call for proposals for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act' and is carried out when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These people, during the call, offer a value higher than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced".
"In terms of the offers, the order of buyers is determined and, afterwards, the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the highest offer", the Fund spokeswoman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to bid and, since he is also an interested party because he acquired various rights of return, he proposed to the interested parties on the land that he would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
That would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for some time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just obtained from the Fund land intended for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular on the site where a major road to the industrial area of Borská pole should be built.
Then he traded them very profitably with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city itself with a much higher value.
In this case, the city had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would prevent construction.
Families will have to pay extra expenses of several hundred crowns a month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher rents.
Consequently, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns more per month from the portfolio from January than they do now.
The price of electricity rises by 4.6%, gas by around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for water supply and many cities are also raising the price of central heating.
The electricity bill for families living in apartments should be about 100 crowns more per year than it is now.
However, the main electricity suppliers reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when heating is used most and therefore consumption is higher.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundred crowns more a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the country, the price change for central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is planned mainly by the largest municipality.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay about 50 crowns more per month for central heating from January, while families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 crowns more per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to bear a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rent for infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will remain among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will rise by 7.4%.
Rental prices for 450,000 rented flats in Prague, where regulation will end in January, may rise considerably.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take those who disagree with the new rent to court.
Regulated rents, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by up to 10%.
The young Czechs get drunk on Fernet and rum.
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from their parents.
Those are the drinks that provoke those who end up in medical care young drinkers under the age of fifteen.
Children who end up lying in hospital continuously to overcome hangovers are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who encounter such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is out of fashion, because it takes a long time to get drunk".
"Now the trend is for strong alcoholic beverages", says Luděk Pelikán, head of pediatrics at the Hořovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they get a bottle from their father's cupboard, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka".
"Wodka has the advantage of being lighter with juice and less odorful", he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokeswoman for Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinová.
"Usually it's Fernet or rum".
"That's modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren".
"In some cases, they use homemade water", adds Jurinová.
According to Chief Pelikán, it's thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers who usually show up in hospitals.
Before Hořovice, where she has been working since this year, she worked for a decade in pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to go in maybe four times".
"It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture of ecstasy", says the department doctor about this case.
"He was at the Holešovice fair at some dance party".
"The interesting thing is that her mother was not surprised that her daughter disappeared for 48 hours", the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest by parents or even their clear tolerance of drinking by their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among youths.
Experts point out that in the case of children, dependency is not a word.
"An alcoholic is a person who has had a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children".
"In those who drink repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment", explains chief Pelikán.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol forty drunken children were hospitalized until mid-November.
However, statistics only show those who come with severe intoxication and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after an out-of-state medical examination, go home to their parents or the police, are not counted.
In addition to the cases where children simply gather after school and drink a drink, there are three seasonal highs and lows for Pelikán to mention: witches' day, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"In such circumstances, they drink to the bad grades or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holidays".
"On Halloween, I've seen as many as seven drunken children at the same time", Pelikán adds.
Drunkards who spend the night in detox under medical supervision, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headaches, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, are avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"These people are much better off because after a hectic night, they get up well and don't feel any pain".
"They just get confused about where they are", Pelikán notes, adding that patients often lose their sense of humor at least when they see the expenses they have incurred.
The transfer by ambulance and the hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs about ten thousand crowns.
"I have often used cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell the children directly how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend the whole summer in a youth job so that you would earn enough to pay yourself that night", Pelikán adds.
The medical insurance, in his opinion perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159s found in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft out of a total of five, with which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed on Tuesday for Seville, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time that a device of this type has been in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
At the time, they were only abroad for practice or demonstration flights.
It is the L-159T1 two-seat version, which was previously used by the Czech Army and was still in flying condition.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are still held at Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, took over them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 monoplane, on the other hand, was separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without any investments or additional contributions from the Ministry".
"The two-seater L-159T1s were exchanged in their current state", he told Právo Pejšek.
He added that the army is not without two-seaters, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Aer Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices for two-seaters.
One of the new planes has already been delivered to the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed to adding the aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
'The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the one to take the L-159s out and that they will be used for pilot training from NATO countries.'
"It is therefore up to the buyer to decide how they will be used in this context", Pejšek points out.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published early on that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.500 million crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defense management claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 overseas.
The Czech army has acquired 72 aircraft from Aer and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa planes may have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already brought the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Prague's Kbely airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have a longer index than the ring are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British cancer magazine.
It could depend on your testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to 60 years of age", said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could therefore help determine which men should be screened for prostate cancer, particularly if this trait is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles said.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed up with a British counterpart more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They were as likely to get prostate cancer as the 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers.
In men with an index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; in men aged less than 60%, the reduction was 87%.
The relationship between the lengths of the two fingers in question, as determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he is aware of the study, but that he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, dawned on Thursday with snow.
Roads and sidewalks are mostly covered in compact snow and snowplowers circulated all night through numerous areas.
In the morning the D5 road between kilometres 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of Ústředního automotoklubu (ÚAMK).
A truck broke down on kilometer 91, two industrial vehicles collided on kilometer 93 and injured.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometre 185 in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks crashed there.
Drivers must drive slowly after Brno at kilometre 190 or through Brno and join at kilometre 182 at Kývalce.
There have been traffic jams for several kilometers.
There's also been an accident on the D11 just outside Prague.
Prague is covered in a layer of several centimeters of snow and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Traffic is forming in Prosek, for example, although Štěrboholská is also congested.
The safest means of transportation is the subway.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo náměstí and Náměstí Míru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another state of emergency will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport was closed from 11pm on Wednesday until 5am.
Today, most of the roads in southern Moravia are open to traffic, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brněnska snow is forming and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access roads to the highest points.
One of the worst affected places was Vyškovsko.
The Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice connections are closed for the moment.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment it is not possible to say when they will be opened to traffic.
In Hodonínska, caution is required in the area of the Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathians).
Roads in the region, which, since it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in a dormant state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall gradually recedes in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American military is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the code name XM-25.
The generals hope the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and "change the course of the game" toward their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually function as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Of course, normal protection cannot be used, and when it casts its murderous shower of metal splinters, it can prove essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it so that they find the target, point their laser beam at it, which determines the distance, then gets a precise aim point and, based on that, corrects the line of projection and pulls the trigger".
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters".
"When the trigger is pulled, the gun is loaded and throws the projectile at a distance of 1,600 feet [543 m], plus minus one, two, or three feet [1,200 m]", says Audette.
400 jobs are being moved
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the following year, 400 employees will move their workplace from their former office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the computer and maintenance giant announced on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from their former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term another 100 more employees of the consortium, who were previously scattered throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will favour the way employees work.
Besides, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The brilliant connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company in the region caused yesterday joy among those in favour and disappointment among those against.
The head of the Frankfurt economy section, Markus Frank (CDU), said that he had won a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent site survey".
Fujitsu settles in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (the Greens) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The management informed the city of their intention earlier.
"We have naturally offered the company our help", Korwisi stated.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz could not change in the difficulties.
After all, economic motives led to the crash.
So there's a big vacancy to fill in the famous post.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord will be cooperative".
The building previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of a controversial beach town construction project with the remaining buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the city hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is responsible for the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the gaps as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 investment advisory and valuation firms, the software manufacturer for booking systems Start Amadeus, and then Siemens merged with the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, were established.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu consortium is recognized as the world's third largest IT provider.
It has enterprises, such as computers and servers, and also provides the necessary services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more business in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is established in Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the next subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why they've rented 7,000 square feet in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plan, houses among others the central association of electrotechnics and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancels the server - Threats against Assange
The anguish is taking over WikiLeaks more and more.
Internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
Possibly behind this is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, is reportedly being detained in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, ever more strong in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
Well-known American Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, should remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"WikiLeaks has been removed from Amazon's server".
"Speak freely in the land of freedom", activists reported the revelations via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the internet company Amazon had deleted the WikiLeaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had turned to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website to deal with the high access figures to the documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Fine, we'll spend our dollars hiring people in Europe".
If Amazon has problems with free speech, "they should stop selling books".
Amazon stopped the use of its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman requested investigations, CNN reported, according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate's national security council had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished Amazon would take these measures earlier, before the previous publications of classified information through Wikileaks", the senator declared.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and reckless process of Wikileaks puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world", the independent senator's statement said.
"No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on the Interpol wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is being held in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently called the investigation in Sweden a plot by his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there had been threats.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange".
That's why you fear for Assange's safety, Hrafnsson claimed.
So, the location of the WikiLeaks founder remains unrevealed.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has claimed that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be tried for treason and should be executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated, clearly ironically, on television that Assange should "be killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
A great dispute is growing between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange has asked for the Secretary of State's resignation, in case she is responsible for recently ordering diplomats to engage in espionage.
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", Gibbs declared.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website".
The American government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counterterrorism Center, has been named special counsel, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the major structural reforms" that are necessary in light of the Wikileaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the US government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything we can to contact them", State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're prepared to help protect you if necessary".
The ice cream college
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice cream is prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
Where does all the ice cream really come from?
The ice cream maker and the ice cream man.
The gelatiere makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of making ice cream.
The ice cream man takes the ice cream out of the counter with a spatula, spreads it on the barge, and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream in its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream makers has the highest influx and visitors from around the world.
There are also more special, multi-day courses on chocolate ice cream and internships at the ice cream parlor at home.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia to Hungary.
Jacky, a California ice cream teacher, loves the slow movement of food and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own within a few years in a tiring job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of their ice cream bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Ice cream master Luciano Ferrari then explains to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
Not only is it good taste, but it is also silky soft and consistent.
Luciano does not forget his training or the cream cover of the national and mainly southern upper house: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic".
The first step to the elaboration seems very easy.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients - milk, cream, milk powder, sugar, and stabilizers - into a large blender, which heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and at the same time cools it down to four degrees.
Then you open the tap of the machine and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all kinds of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the teacher asks: Can ice cream be made with only natural ingredients or without a stabilizer?
How can you let go of some desire to experiment?
Luciano advises that you disregard the trends of the day.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, guar beans.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, you just have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite into a sonorous granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are permitted.
They use scents.
As for the taste of the ice cream, Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit or candy section of the supermarket.
Plus, there's powder and paste.
"All suppliers will try to slip flavored ingredients into their merchandise".
"But you must try it sometime".
Whether it's fruit ice cream with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the basic white dough ice cream, which with eggs will turn into a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as the basis for all the possible pleasures of chocolate.
Now the course participants can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream at a time, chocolate, moca and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the basic dough, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural ingredients.
They're doing the same experiment with different types of fruit ice cream.
That it tastes better doesn't necessarily depend on it having more toffee or more fruit purée.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't have to taste like nuts if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group makes the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water, and somewhat less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mix highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
The preparation of ice cream is a problem of aritmetic: Peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe must be lowered.
Lemon ice cream needs an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano takes out a tool with which he fixes the amount of sugar in the types of fruit (the winemaker's measurement for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make it easier to count.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It's not just the tool that helps with the automatic preparation of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to sub-zero temperature.
Still, all automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
Gustavo from Brazil stains himself and his teammates from top to bottom with fruit purée, as if he were a mini-first giant out of control.
"In all courses", says teacher Luciano, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens".
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has infiltrated the industry experimenting with GM crops.
The matter is currently being formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for the assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well", Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of Efsa's expert group on genetically modified plants, and another Efsa expert have also been employed for years by the Ilsi association.
Consortia like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer are paying for it.
Kuiper has contributed significantly to Efsa's testing standards for genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, Then criticizes.
Efsa's provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the Ilsi situation and mimic the company's deed, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
So, recently, a high-ranking manager of Efsa went without the support and time to transition to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, made by the Environmental Officer General as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some from industry, are used, provided they are of high technical quality, and are arranged in a report.
The experts working at EFSA are not required to have no contact with industry.
But you must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobbying.
On this subject, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that GM crops are currently allowed without research into animal feed and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture", says Then.
Current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the whole transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you going to find them?" he asks, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck is of the same opinion.
Since 1994, she has been researching the field of genetic engineering and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the USA and in Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
That is why there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls the safety research", Hilbeck maintains.
The trail of stones
Uli Gsell has got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday, I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
It was snowing.
The story is well known: In September, the bulldozers arrived and began to tear down a large part of the north wing.
The Stuttgart ground was never the same again: thousands and thousands demonstrated against s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
Because it was sealed, most of the wing was reduced to rubble.
It's spinning in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got a couple of pieces secured.
"These stones are relics".
"They must not disappear".
He's excited, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural".
Like you said once, he smelled the smoke from cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell is too.
The Stuttgart stone trail leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man deals in antique stones.
He's bought everything that comes from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"There would be dishonor, the gravel would be ground or sent to the garbage dump", says a wooden hut that was once a guardhouse in his office.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the 21S's enemies for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the downing.
And when it happened, it was the most reasonable thing, when the stones were still being used.
Some 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80 kilos cut, with a price per piece of 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
He owns gardens, landscapes, projects.
They came from everywhere and took what they could carry in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kräuterbeeten.
"This stone is really nothing special", says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component".
He climbs into his SUV, takes a tour of his great 20-acre kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, became interested in computers and finally works with stones.
And he's a lover of stones.
It houses 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He claims to be the biggest antique stone dealer in the country.
Pull the brakes.
In the snow are artistic crushed sandstone stones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke bridge", he explains.
It's like the dawn, yellow, warm, it's exciting.
"My dear stone".
The road crosses the forest.
It points to a lot: red sandstone, a former section of Karlsruhe station.
And then on.
"Beautiful travertine". What is that?
The squares formerly belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
All over the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, tuff from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple device and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if anything were destroyed".
He hasn't become rich, not at all immensely rich.
But today 14 people have given the stone tradesman a job, plus a stonemason, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying", says the man who takes care of the waste.
He's going to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be salvaged there too.
Talent struggle around great potential
Queen's active an influx at the buffet.
16 students cluster around the buns, the tomato soup and the sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a sort of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn all about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, like VW, are coming together in a hand-to-hand fight around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To recruit the most talented students from universities as soon as possible, before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And since universities don't make it easy to publish on their students' skills, they try to spot outstanding talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the consortium wins the talent.
A lady from the personnel department is handing out pens, gummies and folders with the VW logo.
It explains the apprenticeship programmes and student jobs to the excited young talents and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is leading the project with VW.
He sees advantages for both parties: "Students get in touch with industry and gain experience".
"In turn, VW can get to know the students, take a closer look at the interesting candidates and consider them as potential future workers".
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
"The main focus was previously on technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from a large pool of applicants.
If not, they have to advertise and, above all, to get a highly skilled workforce.
All students in engineering are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 engineer vacancies in October.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this engineer gap will grow even larger.
At the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organises expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern gymnastics, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG's subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It's decided who should go in two rounds of election at the exit.
Only the cream of the crop of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly striving to select and polish the high potential of the universities, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race".
"The simple journey alone was short".
For scout Dykta, grades are results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants".
"Some are close to their end, and they want to apply to work with us", he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also on the hunt, especially small and medium-sized companies, classic with their job fairs.
"We try to get students at the trade fairs".
"Something about Intersolar", says Sitha Stübe, who is in charge of personnel for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems of the new generation.
The company's website currently lists 35 vacancies.
"It's been very difficult to fill the vacancies".
"It takes a lot of time and money", he says.
A shorter route is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher education institutions, for example the University of Freiberg.
"Professors advise that you can do internships with us or do your thesis.
No expensive advertising campaigns are run for solar specialists.
That is why the company needs to promote itself with other advantages: personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium cannot normally offer it", says Stabe, the person in charge.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, childcare or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
For that he asks the employee how satisfied he is with the work and the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
Stübe, the personnel manager, is also hoping for extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
"I think the applicant is particularly focused on the external ratings of a potential employer", he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutschen Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns them a good reputation as employers.
Advise your clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mostly internal measures.
"The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves", he says.
In the jargon of the industry, it's called internal employer branding, also the promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors".
When you treat people well and they identify with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer from friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game", says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby unilaterally cancelled his previous plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling sites remain closed for the time being.
This was announced by the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, on Wednesday.
The reason for this strict ban, which will be in effect for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of 11 workers and caused the biggest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama had allowed new drilling in the western Gulf of Mexico under pressure from the opposition and industry.
The supporters wanted to reduce the US's dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
It is not yet clear who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of lawsuits.
An Obama-appointed commission of inquiry will present its findings in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out another catastrophe by applying tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
The responsible control authority, which has fallen into disrepute after being accused of corruption, is currently undergoing a complete overhaul.
Obama announces in parallel that the lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to stricter regulation, to date.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries", says the result of the current survey conducted by consultancy BDO - ahead of Wednesday's extraction ban.
American Energey Alliance complains about the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows exactly what changes with regulation".
Investments in new extraction projects are temporarily delayed, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water in the rivers is brown oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of spilled oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari is fine with it.
"Don't get tired", the environmental activist reassures the journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes".
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph children wading in the water up to their chests with the glow of lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
You don't see brown oil spots floating on the surface.
Before, I used to catch shrimp by hand, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the running water is completely dead.
Five years ago, a tremendous amount of oil was spilled into the formidable wetland by a broken pipe.
Fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: in the heart of the Niger Delta in Ogonilandia, considered one of the most stinking regions in the world.
On the way the river runs through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the boat's engine removes a brown broth, and whoever dips their hand in the water will get a few full oils out.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the colliding palm trees and hanging their palms.
In vain are flocking birds searched, as if they were in the wetland as usual: As soon as the barrier from the outside is silent, a kind of phantom calm of a former paradise with the smell of a gas station expands into it.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle", says Celestine Akpobari, with a sigh. "We live in constant danger to health".
The war comparison proceeds.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a battleground for years: Here the first European explorers burst in over 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here the first factory had to be set up by the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, companies are forbidden to return to Ogonilandia: While they were pumping more than two million barrels of black gold daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location too unstable for the consortium.
Every 200 yards, steel platforms protruded like bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas Trees" called affectionately to the drill heads.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them are completely corrosive.
Every time a head fails, Akpobari says, a constant jet of oil flows into the water.
According to experts' estimates, over two billion liters have been spilled in 50 years into the delta's ecosystem: Year after year, the amount of oil is being spilled, as was the case with the Exxon Valdez shipwreck 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region, will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see breaking heads and leaking pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low safety standards normally in the conventional world, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only the pipe defect rates are "about a multiple greater than elsewhere".
In a place that from afar seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among the many barrels, sometimes attached to the drilling, sometimes scattered arbitrarily over the ground, a fire is blazing: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the group's head.
First, the gasoline enters the tank through the pipes, then the oil pipes drip out and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel daily: "It brings us 34,000 naira", about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil-producing states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of just 40 euros-cent per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: They reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from the "bunkers", who rigged the pipeline network that runs through Ogonilandia: According to experts, at least 16 million liters of oil are lost every day in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the temporary raw material stored is clearly refined illegally: Organized criminal networks, which also include politicians and high military officials, store the best part in aljibes and sell it cheaply on the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers the debate over whether the environmental catastrophe is due to population management or the lax way of production to be purely academic.
"If oil companies had not behaved like invaders and had not completely destroyed the fish's natural habitat, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries".
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction from the consortium appears: "Maybe it is better to present another nationality, like the Chinese one".
Michael is getting nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear", says the muscular Ölmann.
"The soldiers may come any minute".
If the army special unit catches the illegal refiners, it doesn't threaten to arrest them, but rather a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to profit from the raw material.
"This damned invention has completely torn our country to pieces", says Akpobari.
Investigators detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a major safety problem.
In an investigation of a crash-landing machine, researchers found a possible factory defect that can produce "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas Airlines wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were far more fortunate than you might imagine: Australian air safety authorities have detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a cuff connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused "catastrophic engine failure".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 series aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus which had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in federal court in Sydney that allowed for further legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, Qantas' director, stated that his airline will seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine's mark has lost parts and its wing is damaged.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
Australian researchers announced that they will conduct further safety tests on superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, spokesman for ATSB.
The security issue has become sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily grounded.
Lufthansa replaced the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-decker plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes chaos in traffic.
Germany: Almost all over the country snowed overnight.
Many streets are in chaos, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Germany: Freezing temperatures were recorded in most of the country on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos in many places.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a layer of snow as thick as six inches [15 cm].
Traffic is very limited on most highways and many streets.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the snowplow is in continuous operation, removing the new snow over and over again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong winds sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects high tides with the water level 1.2 metres above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and national roads.
According to Meteomedia, the red alert is called in Sächsischen Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partially 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and strong, cold winds swirl it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there overnight.
In Saxony Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, fallen trees on the tracks or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
Firefighters and rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with wool blankets, food and drink.
The winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany's largest airport, snow-covered winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, there are already 40 flights cancelled.
The snowmen are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers stranded at the airport, despite the fact that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
On many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a crossroads in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of snow-covered streets: Here too a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, and the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
A 30-year-old woman also died after she overturned her car near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will become increasingly soft and dust-like and will therefore swirl into gentle streaks.
But the wind will subside.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong, fast winds.
It will no doubt continue to be very cold, in some places up to minus 15 degrees.
Deusche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to break away from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently renovated its headquarters: The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district were modernized; while the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium is apparently looking to cash in on the cost of the renovation, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesman did not name the reasons for the sale in draft.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then rent them again", he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany is again relinquishing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for EUR 272 million from an investor in a fund of the house and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms amounted to some EUR 200 million.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field estimate the value of the newspaper towers, known as "Greentowers", at around 500 million euros.
Whether the renovated buildings are sold to a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been revealed at this time, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn the miners who died
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who thought they were dead after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not yet been found, because security measures remain precarious at the scene.
Almost two weeks ago there was a massive explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the scene of the disaster, but it did not detect any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue teams were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no chance that the miners would have survived.
No bodies have been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people have been changed by the brilliant sunshine at Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They're silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
Flags waved at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would return to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand government president John Key told the memorial service.
"But they never came home".
He can't accept his son's death until he sees his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative event.
The first explosion on November 19 also buried British and South African miners.
Rescue workers began by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases have been removed, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to fall, police chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warrior!
Does gore fit in with art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A one-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and murders his enemies with almost superhuman fights, sounds ideal for young viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies' guts from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as he is actually called, says almost no words throughout the film and the other characters are carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful death cries.
Otherwise they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountainous scenery of Scotland, which the backdrop offers to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a film has multiple target groups it's a shame they can't be mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the drug-dealing hairstyle trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more mainstream humor or some less art house brutality.
A brain mass and a few budding guts can't dissuade most art cinema fans.
Most action fans are bored to death, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck in the calm and fog for an eternity before his team gets to America and goes silent there again.
It's a shame that "Walhalla Rising" hasn't found a film distributor in Germany and will only be released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the bloody and arrogant facade, there is a piece of sometimes exciting cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, it's all about atmosphere, a fever dream transformed into a movie.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hate, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only one little blond boy, who supports Unojo faithfully, retains something like innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior from hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
He represents perdition, but maybe only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mystery movie that you can hate and admire, to be angry and upset and surprised.
It's an experience.
Mysterious earth movements
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
At about midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with North Korea's help in the cube, hidden in a valley that flows out of the river.
According to information from the US CIA's international intelligence service at the end of April 2008, a current reactor is being designed under the name of the nearby el-Kibar, which is very suitable for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
The technique, however, is hardly useful for any other purpose than that of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from inside.
The reactor had been up and running for a while, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it's barely more well-known than it was then, the riddles have grown larger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack the CIA was fully convinced that the Syrians had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but that it saw little indication that there was "a nuclear weapons program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only talk about a "supposed reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation "plausible".
They lack solid evidence, and so does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a senior UN diplomat responded in the summer with a stone-cold reply that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly disposed of the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and cleared the ground on purpose.
However, in June 2008 an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state, of commercial vendors in the moments immediately after the attack, which must have a greater informational value than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
That is why the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always implied that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damaskus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after the particle analyses.
Since then Damascus has refused to discuss it, as well as the satellite images.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection at el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also keeps a strict silence.
"We will never comment", Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "gradually turns into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat is matched with a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally pending a serious breach against the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, over which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not made publicly known what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities located there.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
Possibly located on or immediately adjacent to a military base, Syria is therefore barred from entering the three IAEA sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has requested from the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to warnings from the US Secret Service.
By means of satellite photographs, the IAEA has evidence that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube on the Euphrates bank.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna claimed that at least one of the equipment may be "related to fuel production".
But there is "no indication of sensitive activities", neither of uranium enrichment nor of reprocessing - processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is powered by unenriched uranium.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should be separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
Nor is there any doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
Since hundreds of cargo trucks have disappeared from the ground, no one has any information about where the debris remains.
The OIE considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, unlikely, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the orbiting photographs show that the Syrians made land movements at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence, but it hardly helps to dispel suspicion.
Moreover, in the diplomatic sector it is said that the IAEA has spent some months developing a plan of inspections there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago reassured themselves that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months now, Glyn Davies, a kind of US ambassador has been wielding so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, which should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but still hesitates.
This is a very risky path: it requires a majority of the IAEA governing council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat reflected, "What if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in the time of war
There's been trouble since Angelina Jolie started in the summer with the direction of her yet-to-be-named debut.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serb.
Not much else is known about it, but this is enough for the stir.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations have protested quickly, so at the last minute they moved some filming days planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization for war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
She's not diplomatic. Weeks ago, the women offered her a meeting in Hungary, which she turned down.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's stance on the subject gives victims enough information about the script.
Her organisation in agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly has Jolie written for the scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read the script, granted a strip-and-loose filming permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie didn't go after all.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she introduces herself with great effort to the Yugoslav conflict, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents remain inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online that sounds quite different: The lovers were together before the war started and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
I'm sure Jolie's movie really starts before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie claims, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
They can currently make peace with the Hollywood hackers: while the script is still on the net illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like far away from here
This afternoon is finally good for the Irish.
No sign of distress
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans scream for joy as the music sounds loud, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club is thrilled in Cork, South Ireland, because players are throwing, and finding, ping-pong balls at beer glasses from a distance of three meters.
The bizarre show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus a few plane tickets to Las Vegas for the world beerpong championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this weird drinking game and the discreet computer actually don't make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with it, distract himself from the daunting question, what's the future holding?
The fun in Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will do a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad feeling", he says.
"It's far from home and I don't have a job there yet".
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "he got his dream job as an event manager in one fell swoop, maybe it's a good sign", the young man says and smiles.
Because of the poor prospects at home, two of the Tanners' three brothers have already sought their fortunes abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin is currently working as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: There are many families like the Tanners on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, forecast economists and the ESRI social research institute in Dublin.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 immigrants.
A great loss for this small country of only 4.5 million people.
The forecasts are confirmed, a migratory wave is coming comparable to the one that suffered the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progress that brought great prosperity to the Irish, melancholy is spreading today.
The economic crisis is particularly confusing to young, well-educated Irish people, for whom everything has been upside down so far.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under 30 are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the director in droves from young immigrants, complaining that, "In Ireland everything is sinking".
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, leaves and loses our country and with it a whole generation".
"The last one to close the door".
Leanne Caulfield, law student and president of the Irish Students' Union sees a bleak future because the government is only fixing up and no longer offers prospects for the young people.
"They lower the minimum wage, but they have no strategies for getting new jobs", says the 20-year-old.
Watch your peers go from one unnamed internship to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing".
People like Stephen McLarnon try to look at this issue in a positive way.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair offering a service around the theme of working abroad.
"For those who are starting out, working abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to directing your career", says the manager.
On their website, they have photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another boy snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like working in the galleys, it's about freedom and fun.
For the last six months, Sean O'Donovan has known what it's like to build something elsewhere.
Since there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer to do, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
They're setting up a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen now.
In January, he's going to Hannover or Berlin for the next project.
O'Donovan only sees his homeland a few times because he works overtime to pay off a mortgage on his house in Ireland.
"It's a bit crazy", he says, since it's been a long time since he first stepped on the doorstep of his home.
"I'm making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never this good".
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes to cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with well-kept gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions", he says.
Are you afraid of failing on credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea, and says, "I don't have children to feed, and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start over".
The civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he hears so often these days.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by far, as dramatic as in times past here on the island", he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen, maybe it makes us feel like Irish for the first time".
He laughs and tells about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple".
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future hanging and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's worked in London for a couple of years now, so why wouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that is most troubling him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion", he says and gives a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds very distressing".
"We'd rather call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games".
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger concern than unemployment.
Moreover, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows the changes in attitudes in the region to be monitored.
The results of this year's survey, which was carried out in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor that prevails in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has risen from a low 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a sharp drop in production last year.
However, only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which is lower than the regional average (see Chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same as last year but considerably higher than the 25% recorded in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% said they trusted their country's Congress and 45% their government, the same number as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17% and 24%, respectively).
A decade ago, the economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only hit by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general feeling of progress.
Such feelings are less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that they or a close relative has been a victim of crime in the past year, down from 38% last year and the lowest percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private enterprise and the market economy: around 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development, compared to only 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of Venezuelans surveyed feel the same way (and 80% support private enterprises), even though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds that title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections to the garbage
No one expected the general election held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went much worse than foreigners who are trying to help the country recover from its problems feared.
Votes were introduced at the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown into the sewers, polling stations were destroyed and acts of intimidation.
The polls opened hours late.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered the area trying to figure out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
Protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, stated that they were "relatively good elections in many ways".
The observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that 'we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process'.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which opponents say is committed to the unpopular outgoing president, René Préval, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The play-off is scheduled for January.
All hope has not yet been lost in connection with the elections.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition requesting the vote be invalidated.
But problems could still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr Célestin, who has scarcely any support, if any, has passed to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and that more than a million of the earthquake survivors are still living in tents, a large abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were unable to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, required to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a popular and legitimate government an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And as it turns out, the Haitians themselves think so.
Fingering towards the center
In the weeks since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great deal of public sympathy that has increased her popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level she has recorded since her election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether she can make it a successful campaign for a second term in next year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to take charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had a habit of drawing up budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the additional income at their discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fernandez's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner died of a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the Peronist movement in power have confronted Mrs Fernández.
However, after a chaotic session in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue", said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore apply to the next year, giving the President even more leeway to spend it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, put it at around 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who came to power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made INDEC, the statistical institute, adapt the official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández moderate these policies now?
He's called for meetings between the private sector and union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit next year's wage increases to 18%.
The economy has been boosted by high prices of Argentine agricultural exports to the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps for this reason Mrs Fernandez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a prior forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes around 6.700 million dollars.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the prelude to the cleanup of the INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fernández wants to continue in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he'll need to win the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When Argentinians return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have subsided.
If she wants to win another election, she'll have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policies.
Half a cheer for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 percent of eligible voters, went to the polls on November 27 to elect the mayors and councillors of five urban districts in what appears to be a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become an advocate of sentiment for the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but by a narrow margin.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, he failed to secure a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has been inclined towards full independence from Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential election, Mr. Ma would have been in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city councils.
The election featured typical elements of Taiwanese elections, including noisy campaign trucks and large crowds with little flags and dancing girls in light clothes.
Nor was the mysterious attempted murder of rigor.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
The funny thing is, it's been impossible to determine whether the man intended to hurt Lien or get revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the election, sowing suspicion about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the continent itself was not the issue.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing schemes and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests the military threat from China.
Therefore, the KMT usually avoids publicity of its ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time too the PPD avoided encouraging anti-China sentiment.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, said that his policy towards China had been confirmed as acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to get Taiwan back in the fold.
China did not waste time in sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
I am sure you would like to see political integration as well, but first things first.
The best thing to do is wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the PPD has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was in a bad situation: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned on corruption charges.
President between 2000 and 2008, openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under Ms Tsai's leadership, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been warmly welcomed as the PPD's presidential candidate, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to show that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Mrs Tsai announced plans to set up a group of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that negotiations without preconditions can be conducted.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the PPD candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its potential candidates.
The KMT must also make a conscience check.
Mr. Ma's ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman claims he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large samples from the DPP suggest that Taiwan's support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed".
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise pick in the category of breakthrough artist.
Act on the request of a president and people will probably notice you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the surprises at this year's Grammys with a high-profile nomination in the category of Best New Artist.
Considering that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since her 2008 album, "Hope", the nomination is thought-provoking, but it respects the Grammys' rules that an artist must have released no more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a breakthrough and, considering her light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, one can at least draw a distinction between Spalding and the road to Norah Jones' 2003 success, the closest equivalent to the Grammys voters, who lately have concentrated on the jazz realm for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity", a thrilling and magnificent record that was one of last year's favorites.
Among Iyer's competitors are veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positootly".
Shorty's trombone, a New Orleans favorite and a regular guest on HBO's "Treme", was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise leans considerably toward fusion as in albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned a well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Nominations for the Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for best direction of classical albums
The classical music nominees for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The top nominations were for Michael Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", for piano and orchestra, in five movements, and Steve Mackey for "Dreamhouse", an eclectic three-movement orchestral work.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
The classical music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The category for classic producer of the year includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" by the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Mariinsky Theatre orchestra and choir; and Arthur Sullivan for "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes long, is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin player Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa", Dorman stated in a telephone interview.
85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez was nominated in the orchestral performance category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists nominated are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees for vocal soloists this year are all women: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical mixing category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Proposed mosque in Temecula gets approval from planning commission
The mosque project for Temecula has won unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics attacked the project saying it fosters terrorism and traffic jams.
However, the committee members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center would be aesthetically impressive and comply with local law.
"Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha'is, of all religions", Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic center of Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud of that".
"It proves that justice prevails".
"The opposition is really minimal", he adds.
"They just talk too loudly".
"There are wonderful people in this valley".
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was spent with people interceding for or against the center, practically the same amount on each side, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists", reads one of the comments.
"It's another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand".
"America has fallen".
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the area of New York City where the September 11, 2011 attacks took place.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a property he shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot, Mediterranean-style mosque would include two minarets and rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32 acre site on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new life forms on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new life forms on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it proves that it is possible for life forms to exist without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity".
"It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic".
"That makes it very peculiar, though it is a short distance from being a truly 'alien' life-form", commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report appearing in the Thursday online edition of Science.
For a long time, it has been thought that there are six major elements essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, researchers have discovered that the bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible", said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the find is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the holding of a press conference to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms that use other elements to drive their biochemistry and that the 'standard' set of elements we consider essential for life may not be so fixed", commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the investigation team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element by another in biochemistry and basic biochemical structure", added Cockell.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could substitute one for the other.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus".
"As a result, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate between them".
"However, arsenic is different enough that it does not work as well as phosphorus, so it enters and, so to speak, disrupts the biochemical machinery", explains Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they adapted to and used to grow.
The microbe grows best on phosphorus, but the fact that it can live on arsenic instead raises the possibility that there could be a form of life that naturally uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic can be replaced by phosphorus is not new, but no example has ever been found to prove that it works.
Arsenic was more common in the earliest ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
"It does suggest that there may be other ways of generating life, not just the way life formed on Earth in ancient times", said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
The stolen dogs that were missing in Compton have been found.
The two missing dogs from the four stolen dogs have been found outside the Bellflower motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff's officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis, went missing Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they were spending the night in, outside Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were recovered Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late Wednesday night, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are doing well", Whitmore said.
"They're in good shape".
"They're back with their rightful owners".
Whitmore wouldn't say exactly where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"An investigation is underway".
"We don't want to say anything", said Whitmore.
"We're following some leads".
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached for comment Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit at the local competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, were still missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the national AKC/Eukanuba championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to showcase Trace.
The other dogs were to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the couple's nearly two-month tour of dog racing.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their bedroom window.
They were carrying three other dogs (a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany), who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and they'd be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again as the restructuring of MGM gets final court approval.
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start over.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the creditors' "pre-arranged" plan to write off roughly $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and premiering movies and television shows.
Thursday's ruling confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM being relaunched under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the chief executives of what will be a smaller studio.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not exit Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit facility to finance the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which it is contributing with $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the firm began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management needed to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron Chairman and bankruptcy recovery expert, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial woes and satisfy the studio's more than 140 creditors required much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were seeking.
By the spring of this year, he was back on the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially comes out of bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper's companies will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375,000 a month for their company management services, will receive a "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together an annual slate of seven or eight films to be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "The Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between $265 and $275 million to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a studio merger with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep their gift budget balanced
While the iPad is the leading candidate to be this year's most wonderful toy, followed perhaps by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant bump in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect set costs the same as 10 classic beaded jump ropes, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see which electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law has been working; this year's tech toy will probably have more power, cost the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offerings.
And button-battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 and older) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze starts to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and older) is the best option.
Borrowing technology from last year's Elmo Live, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays shift-shift games like Simon Dice, and can make the moon-step, thanks to its innovative articulated feet with locking wheels.
The children who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a kid in the '80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer-based educational toys.
He's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with an occasional self-correcting exercise book.
If you are hesitant to give your child his or her smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3-8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3-12 years), it is the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, 3-7 years old) uses an iTunes-like system to present games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that allows viewing family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 and up) is a game of five blocks barely larger than a matchbox, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's formidable for an impromptu word-making competition.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two biggest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a pet online at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the code online, your child gets enough credits at the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates on wheels or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the pig in your toothbrush, the Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and up) is the latest in a line of microrobots powered by button batteries.
The fake insect moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It's fun to make a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It's also durable.
Ours was able to leave the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of law enforcement is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the way in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of chengguan, the body-sized urban police of China, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of onlookers.
"Signed!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty the girls are!"
Four girls who barely made it through their teenage years wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and tight pants to get attention.
Four pairs of black shoes perfectly aligned.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed over the hair tied with blue and white striped studs.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance", said Mr. Tang, scornfully.
"The models are cute".
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China's urban inspectors.
A city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the greyish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating glances: in 2009, 50 officers reportedly surrounded a rambling snack cart, and watched it with a constant frown for half an hour, until the street vendor packed his things and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police force, specifically chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough police a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's meager respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors in Hubei Province beat to death a passerby after he used his cell phone to film them dissolving a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and posted online, describing how to effectively whip criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a Shanghai street vendor of watermelons suffered brain damage after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan has left a scar on the government", lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really thorough cleanup".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from this.
After the district notified eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real duties or were simply a stage diversion.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district notice called for female candidates ages 18 to 22, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They must have been above average height, over five feet, two and a half inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said the work was too physically demanding for women over 25.
"Your image is the important thing", an unnamed district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc".
Next comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Female chengguan are like florists, he said, adding, "besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities".
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back up that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means being handsome, it's a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the handicapped or disfigured should not be presented.
"We can't allow a lame person or a humpback to come to work here", Mr. Zheng said.
"Your image would not be good".
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with his cheeks red and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent on her looks is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His fellow dusty worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said, "Our work should present the image of the city".
They also do not object to their work being on time, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply scaring off vendors in the alleys where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squad faces about a dozen street vendors who hurl themselves on foot or by bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu buns or bowls as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave".
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu as a salesman fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle liners.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's pretty much the same every day", said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in his spare time.
"Very routine".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate merchandise from vendors.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public demonstrations of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after a false rumor spread that Chengguan officers had murdered a salesman.
More than a dozen Chengguan police or officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the moment Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a shop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the motorcycle was yelling rude.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with bad faces, made their way to their vehicles and quickly took the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the men's squad, stood behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
As female officers, the coordinators, men aged 40 or over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain a stylish image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally".
"Sometimes we fight physically", Mr. Li said quite naturally.
"Most of the time, it's the audience that starts the fight".
The prosecution will not press charges against Senator Ensign.
The senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have exonerated Senator John Ensign of criminal charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to lobby for work for the woman's husband.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said it felt "surely pleased" with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department had "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of their investigation and that they have no plans to charge him in this matter".
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
The interviews, email and other documents first leaked in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, obtain lucrative lobbying work, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find Mr. Hampton work and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Ensign aide, he was barred by law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for one year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared at odds with the so-called "revolving door lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former government employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, "it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute", said Stanley Brand, a Washington attorney who specializes in defending clients under investigation by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department appeared cautious about accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year's decision to drop prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens amid procedural misconduct charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards", said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them", he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call the next day, telling him the department did not want to press charges against his client.
Ensign's defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to elaborate on the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable going into details about my discussions with the Justice Department, I can only say that we think they made the right decision", he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to reverse an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said they didn't have enough evidence to prove the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, which got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him he was "squatting" the Interior Ministry over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transportation secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first emerged last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, she said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and conclude its investigation.
"Senator Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada", he said.
Cheshire appeal will go to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chattering" in the courtroom rows.
Minute by minute, they were tweeting reports of the appalling testimony.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely-watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire, Connecticut family, is set to come to an official end, with the judge's imposition of the jury-voted death penalty.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments in appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims that intense reporting on the process, including extensive use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details made public passions exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The claim could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"From what I experienced during this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to a fair trial", said Thomas J. Ullmann, lead counsel for Mr. Hayes' defense.
State Superior Court Chief Judge Jon C. Blue laconically dismissed the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of high-profile cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in its decision, in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and movie "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appellate courts that reviewed Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control the way communication from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report saying it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes' lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes may have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them creepy photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury who had criticized prosecutors, and that he incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his bizarre decision to order the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense coverage of the trial may attract most of the interest.
They noted in a denial of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was continually adding fuel to the fire of emotion about the case.
"The daily swarm of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse", the lawyers wrote, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps in the entire state".
His attention to Twitter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that immediate news was more important than slower-delivered reports was a Luddite view that would make the court's policy on controlling coverage weak in future proceedings.
But some lawyers said that appellate courts were often attracted by arguments about the adjustment required in courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage of the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that new media require new rules.
"This case", they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell case of the 21st century".
Can civility bridge the divides?
After a remarkable campaign of invective and negativity, a little civility has been unleashed in Washington this week.
Is it a harbinger of future genuine bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no progress on the big issues that must be addressed during the outgoing session.
But from what everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion of the two parties' differences, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another empty episode to gain partisan points.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the political differences that remain among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated a mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still separates the members.
That is barely enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a testing period, probing each other for signs of cooperativism and compromise, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voter patience for a renewed partisan war.
That is why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of it by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenditure, health care or welfare, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There's no question that things have changed with respect to the way things are said", said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections arouse partisan passions, which then die out.
That's good".
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda for the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody's in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans cannot make it seem that they are in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is increased optimism for a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues in the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
"After the things that must be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will reverse the situation to one of confrontation", he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civicism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a rehearsal for the main event of 2012", he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they should try to deliver on their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health care law.
These party lines are already clearly visible in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the deficit committee, which include reform of the tax code and raising some taxes and the retirement age and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own estimation, have forcibly introduced the deficit issue into the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and they've been struggling to get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is among the officials elected to the panel, suggesting that on tax issues there is, at least at present, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama over the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of increased bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a deadlock, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Whoever they think is losing will probably change course and seek compromise.
However, this may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely the prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility shown this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
The city is controlled by a "kleptocracy", which leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail schemes, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of the bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes its share as money rises in the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there's been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel suits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested he was corrupt, he stated: "It's crazy, it's a hoax, it's a nuisance".
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats of a foreign country to do that.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government with crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional,' and to claim that the government functions more like a kleptocracy than a government", the note states.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a criminal and mafia term that literally means 'roof' or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in the Moscow criminal world".
"Luzhkov is at the top".
"The SFS, MVD and the militia are on the second level".
"Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level".
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a vacuum in some areas, because the city does not provide some services".
The report claims that the SFS collects money from the biggest companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report stated, "explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority".
The note notes that while the money collection is complete, the protection can be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats", said Georgy Satarov, director of the Moscow-based Indem think tank, in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy".
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia".
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
Nationally, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption conducted by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US embassy note, which didn't happen until late at night Moscow time, is sure to cause disgust within the Russian government, and while Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents might be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed American diplomats were calling him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country", he said.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way".
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who had built it, the last leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok".
"He was a good leader and cared about his people", said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "the Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, the long-held loyalty is finally being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of its former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian court issued the first conviction for a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can do nothing", said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Center, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil".
"This is creating divisions within families".
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movement surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrender of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest Khmer Rouge fighters fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many are nostalgic for the movement.
Although a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the Raza soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
"These people have gotten little benefit after the surrender", said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have embedded the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime".
"They were raised with no concept of doing business".
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before turning to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine", he said.
"Ta Mok fed everyone".
"But now life is hard because we have to provide for ourselves".
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concern here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the main leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This didn't do much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died.
On a recent embarrassing afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden poles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Khmer Rouge.
She claimed that if the court summoned her she would not appear.
"Cambodia is peaceful and stable", he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war".
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past", he said.
But facing the past is just what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to the Khmer, is to put the broken pieces back together", he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces together so that we can understand".
The center produced the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", 75 pages long.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education's secondary school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But her parents reacted with skepticism when she took the book home for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court", he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute".
Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too much weed and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone salesman, said he didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him", he said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its weapons-grade uranium stockpile
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the US government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations were conducted with Belarus in the last two months, to remove 84.82 kg of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The agreement appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit".
"This shows that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have kept the highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of which is basically weapons-grade uranium) and the low-enriched uranium", Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone".
"We use it for research purposes, that's all".
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly difficult, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation was completed on Monday and was done by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the low-enriched uranium research facility, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an official at the Department of Energy who works on Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen the trust" that led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserve by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko's harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential detente.
It was stated that "while welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens".
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid expressed in a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the then first vice president of the Government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to prove that they exercised appropriate surveillance over foreign aircraft that cross Spain".
In June 2006, following a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights abuses, a meeting took place between former US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "had taken the Zapatero Government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objections to intelligence flights through Spanish territory".
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "caught off guard", Aguirre reports in a cable.
Also the then head of the Foreign Ministry, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity of influence".
On his part, in January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements or sensitive information", the Embassy explained after speaking with the prosecutor.
However, the US expressed concern over the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between Governments", laments Aguirre.
In March 2007 at a lunch between the US ambassador and the interior minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate", he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflamed rhetoric, in an attempt to lower the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern at the PP's actions in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored actions by the US that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US government", he says.
The confessed stepmother complained on the network of the "agony" of being a mother
The young woman was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
Monica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which she uses since she was a child, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coruña town from which she is originally from.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructed through testimonies of their relatives.
The 30-year-old Galician began a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him take the DNA test.
It didn't take long for him to meet another girlfriend.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the little one stayed with his partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it's clear that their romance was fractured, that they broke up.
In March 2008 she is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very strange and moist, because I came to work".
"When I told her, she was fine, but of course, now she realizes what it's like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do whatever she wants".
Then, he tells the cell phone he just received a message: "I want you back this month or give me an address to send the child to you".
She complains: "If you don't like me leaving the child with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back", she says.
In May, he talks about returning to his village: "I'm going there this week, but I'll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to apply for a job so I don't miss it".
He makes it clear that if everything goes well, he'll take his firstborn.
"He's going to be with who he owes, which is me, and I'll never think of leaving him again with anyone but my mother", doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.

The Populars would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies experienced in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP has already set its sights on the general elections because, whether there is an advance or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles that received in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 general elections, while in the 2006 regional elections, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been fuelled by a surge in PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP electorate, continues, analysts from this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 MPs (it has 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the popular vote, ERC would lose one deputy - now it has three - while ICV would either keep one or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will occur in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular may also be decisive in the end of the socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in its relief at the head of the Diputación de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popularists agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not get a majority or the possibility of turning to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be unreasonable for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its vote in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lleida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced they can lead the coup in the Tarraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has come within 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, has very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popularity has also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many populations as possible.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrested in Barcelona, three in Thailand were arrested in the same year.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian detained by the General Police Information Office in Barcelona were part of a jihadist cell that, run from Thailand, provided passports to different Al Qaeda groups, including the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Laskar and Taiba (Let), the latter responsible for the Bombay bombings that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of assuring that with the "Operation Kampai" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus at international level has been "weakened" and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one the jihadist network had operating in Europe, hence the fact that other European police units have participated in the investigations, in addition to the Thai services, so it is not ruled out that in the next few days similar coups will be carried out on EU territory to the one that took place last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand with the capture of Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijrungbum.
These were the ones who ran the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - stole mainly from tourists passports that met the requirements set by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents had to be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
The investigation highlights that, at the moment, no data has been found linking those arrested in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the perpetrator of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were later used by the members of the "command" that ended the life of 106 people.
The police have seized a wealth of documentation.
PP demands Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas her conditions to support her investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and presiding over pro-sovereignty adventures, as is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the equator of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan popular went to the meeting of Artur Mas with the security that gives having obtained 18 deputies in the elections of last Sunday, a figure more than enough to make herself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the vote of investiture.
The future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but, for now, the conversations that Mas is holding these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an inauguration "she will have to put aside all the sovereigntist and independence discourses", as well as the economic concert - similar to the one in the Basque Country - which the convergent leader even intends to submit to a referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to slimming the political apparatus of a very inflated regional administration and the elimination of inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's investiture will be dealt with by Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat from the PPC.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a tough opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician claims the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of Olot Center do not rule out that their coward killed more than 11 elders
The senior staff of La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elders while employed there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the accusation against the responsible" of the deaths but "the legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible".
And besides the social disrespect that the entity may suffer for not having detected the criminal activities of the co-ordinator in time, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge pointed out in the car that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatric hospital - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the deceased but, according to the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was done by telephone.
Caritat, through its director, yesterday roundly denied this extreme and pointed out that "the lack of measures can not have been at any time the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is not a single indication in the case that there was any reckless action by anyone other than the accused himself".
Already known as "Angel of Death", he confessed to 11 murders the day before and said that he committed the first on August 29, 2009, to kill a second grandmother a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the centre's staff have access to medicines.
Insulin injections and a cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine murders that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the sufferings of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify whether Vila is not lying and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them from the inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed to the three women he killed between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the co-leader, not even to the number of confessed murders, which do not rule out that it is superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the little sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having committed, successfully, eight murders.
That's why they say they're making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threatens
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet's threat yesterday that warned "markets must not underestimate our capacity to react".
The spreads on peripherals have closed sharply and European bank stocks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's capacity to make mistakes, and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is characteristic of an illiquid market which, just as it collapses, recovers but is motivated by closing short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will soon lose his fear.
A month ago the ECB summoned us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
The Bundesbank demanded that the public debt purchase plan be terminated as ineffective and that all extraordinary liquidity measures be removed and that only unlimited access be allowed on a weekly basis.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures 'at least until March' and to maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond-buying programme and even signal an intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to be obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
Like their May meeting where they said they hadn't even considered buying bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday's one-year-old letters auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment following Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been made public.
The figures are estimated at about 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to detect the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the aid plan and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will have to get parliamentary approval for its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease tensions ahead of the upcoming summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, when a political compromise is needed to show that we are one and that we all play the same tune.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of the world Beethoven's hymn of joy.
In Spain, the President had the gift of opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatisation, measures to revive employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains why the Spanish stock market has risen by 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock markets.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
There's a key auction today of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope it will be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a relief plan would be self-immolation.
They'd give us a liquidity line we don't need, the Treasury has over 40 billion in liquidity available, triple what it had in March, at very high rates and closes you off from the markets without saying.
However, the strategy should remain that of Caesar's wife, "in addition to being, appear to be".
Come on, we can do this.
Eulen's president will challenge the Vega Sicilia board requested by his sons
The storm is not going to ease the open conflict in the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the group's founder, will challenge, considering it "nula de pleno derecho", the judicial board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to enforce their majority and get the management bodies of the titular firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control of part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
The board was dissolved by five of his seven sons who were appointed as directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year and whose appeal is noted in the Commercial Register.
The judicial meeting of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of Mercantil Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of thunder in the heart of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to fix the meeting is, until the dispute is resolved, the only legal mechanism which guarantees the convening of the meeting.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants their five children to, through procedural wisdom, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of right, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18", according to their official spokesmen.
This argument will be the basis for the board to challenge the decision, considering it to be 'null and void'.
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully to get the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a holding company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David Álvarez's seven sons control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group claims, however, the usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the appeal hearing has taken place, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull burst onto the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select world of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a newly arrived squad and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the triumph of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without belittling the skill as a driver of the eventual champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team has become a legend.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company put on the market in 2007 for purposes far removed from high-level automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design assembly lines for manufacturing plants around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, to simulate faithfully the product or process before actually building it, thus avoiding failures and avoidable costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in his Formula 1 factory has enabled Red Bull to design and implement "in a matter of hours, almost in real time", the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in tests.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team now employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyse and design all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is the sole responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
Changes can be brought from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limitation to this madness of technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula One team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce its cars in a town some 30 miles [50 km] from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "highly secret".
The staff for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull's Formula One, without a doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the energy drink brand has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is invaluable and their notoriety zero.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in car-car racing contributed 50% of the wins and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes in Barcelona yesterday.
This will be the first of a network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to set up in Spain over the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice-president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran Vía barcelonesa, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 branded sales points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona coming third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also assured that the philosophy for installing the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP provides training for staff in the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of shops aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in purchasing, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-leading pilot program that solves potential problems with HP's warranty computer equipment.
An online service connects to a technical centre in Maastricht, the Netherlands.
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that sometimes take up to two days".
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell is betting on 'stealing' a million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell's CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the war on liabilities.
It does, however, foresee a collapse in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in commissions and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private clients in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will launch a new management plan in 2011 for a period of three years.
The objective, besides surviving without having to resort to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting one million new private customers -700,000 if those who can leave the bank are discounted-, its great pending subject, since until now it had pampered more SMEs and companies than retail customers.
This year it has attracted 250,000 private customers and 50,000 corporate ones.
Its market share in the private sector is 3.5%, while in the business sector it is more than 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or what is the same, to austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges the bank will expose when it presents the results of the financial year.
Few banks are now daring to set targets and make them public, since the financial crisis has upset all the plans of the world banking system.
Sabadell will close its Optima management plan, which was set up four years ago, this year, although it was initially for three, but the situation on the markets meant that it will be extended for another year.
Customers who let their savings boxes slip will be their primary target.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and momentous" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And, although he thinks the war on liabilities - which penalizes margins - is being reduced, the price of the risk premiums that banks and coffers are paying for their issues to obtain liquidity are already moving to the credit price to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it's going to be a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't closed the tap, but the differentials are higher", Guardiola acknowledged.
Banesto has already given orders to his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and raise the price of differentials - see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking now "is to raise commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says, "larger sizes will be required" in Spain.
"Next year it's going to move everything", he said.
It states that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution is in the red.
It also points out that the FROB can supplement the market in raising funds in the event of new recapitalisations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, he downplayed what some bankers are already predicting as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but unlike in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repos, which cushions the crisis.
ECSC rules out a second wave of mergers in the coffers
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that a wave of mergers of savings banks would occur and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of concentration of Spanish savings banks began, several entities said they would not participate in this first phase and would reserve for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol to the group of Banca Cívica can not be said to be a second round, what there are adjustments".
"Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has also collaborated a lot", the director pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta has exposed that the process of concentration is being undertaken "at the greatest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is going on in the timeframes that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
"Going from 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million in assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet the requirements of Basel", he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unfortunate opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge".
The director pointed out that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the greatest speed possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had performed very well in the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoe and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have prompted a twofold government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to small and medium-sized enterprises, regulation of private placement agencies or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without provision, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How are we to interpret these movements?
Go ahead, Merkel's position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another twist in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which clashes with the old traditions of many of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, speculation is beginning in Germany about the three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro, with Austria and the Netherlands among others, while the South would leave the monetary zone.
The second is the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favorable opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third is a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines on the offending countries, possible suspensions of payments for some of them and the extension of the costs of potential adjustments to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission were stimulating deficits, the German government pulled out of hand a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed needed to be done (fiscal rigor and fiscal stability plans) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow to the fore was the Central European country when Merkel painfully prolonged the decision to rescue Greece.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public and published opinion were strongly against the Greek bailout.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerged with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union's treaties, to make it possible to rescue a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, has been approved and we should be witnessing the process of reform of the Union in the coming months, which will make those measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, although measures must now be taken with which he may not agree, from that date the old functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary area, where infringing countries will be severely punished, may be forced to declare a suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also bear part of the cost.
Germany is telling us that we must follow a hard path of growth with high saving and investment rates, moderate consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, like the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The invitation is clear.
And we would be wrong not to understand that.
It is not just a question of bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope the current turmoil will give way to greater calm.
And let's take advantage of the window of opportunity that's been given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order in the home has been opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't look like they're going to move it.
And, among the possibilities envisaged, the possibility of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unimportant countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and law-breaking
Tricks like Alonso and Ramos's against Ajax show ingenuity but no will to escape a penalty.
The allegedly orchestrated expulsion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League has prompted rivers of ink to be written about whether such behaviour is or is not anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, with a few minutes to go before the game was over (which their team had clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time when they made three fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid will finish as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction in the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and can pass to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned the team's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
Provoking a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but rather a common practice in the world of football.
It's so widespread that it's part of the ethos, the unwritten, but followed, rules of this sport.
Part of the debate in the case is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and which in past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to his long history of histrionic and provocative technician.
In any event, the debate is on whether such behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether such behaviour constitutes a breach of the law, since it is in fact an act which respects the sporting rules but seems to evade their purpose.
The question is to examine the kind of damage they do to the sporting spirit.
One of the assets of the sporting spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these goods referred to by fair play is to prevent the team of offending players from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that they did not comply with what we normally call cheating or fraud, because their violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the penalty, but precisely their action tried to be the most obvious so as to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the punishment.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders get in the intentional misconduct examined.
It seems necessary to note here that neither the rival is placed at a disadvantage nor the same game is profitable, for the result of the action is obviously to leave the team itself with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club won't be able to count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team may be eliminated at the first replacement, and also with this performance the players complete a penalty match and move to the second round of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with one less than in the first round.
So, going round and round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In short, these actions are not contrary to the spirit of sport, which is to take strategic decisions that make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case at hand, the players did not act to evade the application of the penalty (this would be a clear case of law-fraud), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without escaping punishment or running from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and law-breaking is blurred, I think this was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, I think, stems from two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the directive was transmitted.
The damage to sporting principles caused by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Tendering campaign to capture group Christmas dinners in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year a flood of reservations for the 16th and 17th.
Self-sacrificed celebrations by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros, are proliferating.
Like the turrón and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise as a ball of oxygen for the restaurant and leisure of Barcelona, but which because of the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to capture the majority of customers: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals, agree the entrepreneurs and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complicate the accounting, this year's calendar (when New Year's Eve falls on Friday) has concentrated the requests on the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinners reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and hardly any movement for the week before.
As has been happening since 2008, when the lean cow phase began, many companies have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To keep up with tradition, many workers keep up with it by paying out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, some people demand a price tag, confirms the president of the Gremi de Restauració of Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The employer's representative, today, does not dare to predict how the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think a lot before they book".
"He wants to leave but he has the alerts on the price issue", he points out.
Business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to go down a step with the crisis, so that the 25 euro band has become the majority in demand.
A survey of several central establishments shows a collapse in requests for the night of the 17th.
In the Soteras group, they indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretence of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early booking, even since the beginning of November.
"We have done everything possible to maintain the same prices as last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros", they say.
AN Grup, which leaves El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, remains optimistic after detecting a rise in turnover since the second half of the year and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group stress that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the holidays.
To their six group menus they have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green shoots in some companies that are inviting their employees back and a feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat larger.
On the part of the employer Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, is confident in starting to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that in general the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
The illusion of celebrations has not gone down, pay whoever pays, he indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad is producing atomic weapons "at a faster rate than any other country".
WikiLeaks leaks confirm the ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department leaked by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns that are being raised in Washington over the Pakistani nuclear program.
Apart from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the talks and the thoughts of the accredited American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "growing", and that the unstable Asian country is producing nuclear weapons "at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy them in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for the uncertainty in Washington.
So lists Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan in a report prior to the visit of then-National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of transportation of atomic materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the United States but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to keep on guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural standards, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missile programs", said Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev at a meeting with his American counterparts.
The most newsworthy of the leaked documentation by the Julian Assange portal is the declining cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high pace of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A May embassy dispatch, calling communication with Pakistan "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often lacking; offers of help go unanswered or are dismissed".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a National Intelligence official for South Asia, notes that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end its tacit support for terrorist groups".
The hunt for the Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a top counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a red alert in order to track the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it's difficult to be certain about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
It is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter million US diplomatic documents but with the sexual abuse allegations the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for Wikileaks' creator, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr Assange".
It was on the 20th that the international police force based in Lyons (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
As it stands, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications to identify or locate Assange "with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called red notice a free way to proceed with an arrest - which must be undertaken by the national police force -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement has outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder has shown himself willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, who is compared to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of Stalin's security.
"This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution", the letter denounces.
While the world is searching for him - and his mother is defending her son's innocence from Australia - Assange remains unknown, but not silent.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the editor of Time magazine via Skype from an undetermined location, a conversation in which he asked for the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy on the UN violating international treaties that the US has signed, he should resign", he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website", he told CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a top counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to downplay Assange contrasts with the views being expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and fund it and to pursue anyone who gives them any contribution or help".
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has gone even further, having to retract after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should make him a target and use a drone or something".
The one who did not apologise was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever in the government leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind of a punishment", he declared on Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with winking eyes to Carod's allies
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuance.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and an end to the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to sort out the enesim internal revolt in the ranks of ERC, without a north for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his resignation letter is insufficient for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can cause him the head-breaking he had with other extinct currents.
So the leader of Esquerra will try to win over the new critics with winking eyes that will allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcercós announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to make their own secret pronouncements on the continuation of the ERC.
By ballot, not by hand.
If the cheerleaders want to convey some sort of punishment vote to the president, they can do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the leader of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he said that he would not consider ratification with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that a result "in the Bulgarian way" would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand that the president do more than put his office at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that does not apply when Puigcercós controls the highest body between congresses.
But since they don't have enough votes to force resignations, they're going to try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document which the management will submit to the national council for vote on the 18th.
His intention is to endorse Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to advance the congress to autumn 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that "polyphony" undermines stability and that his aim is to make the organisation once and for all able to wash the dirty rags from doors inwards.
In this line, the article that acting councillor Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Considered Puigcercós' ideologist, the head of Innovació took for granted that the leader would be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five, two of which stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, to include new faces from the Carod-like sector.
The second one might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC should abolish assembly as a functioning mechanism.
It proposes a reform of the statutes to allow congresses to be held by delegates elected by popular vote.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, has been an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the task to the management of revising the assembly in a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This appointment is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years discouraged addressing the matter.
Now, with no critical sectors lurking, it may be a good time to resume and try to shut it down for good.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico recorded a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.

A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his home to start garbage collection.
On November 7, two 30-year-old men were killed by a bullet to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, Ecatepec municipality.
In Chalco, with the gunshot wound to the forehead, the body of a man was found on a lonely road in the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a shell casing from a .25 caliber gun.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency services conducted a thorough search for the other body members, but they were nowhere to be found.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán alerted about the finding of a body that was in the area Peña Colorada, who was tied hands back and with his head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
Halfway through the month, two men were reportedly executed, wrapped in coffins and left in the cajuela of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda fraction in the municipality of Atizapán de Zaragoza, along with two death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valley of the Kings colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony, he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag. The rest of the body was found with a message signed by The Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the town of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, presumably identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executors left with him.
In Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the town of San Francisco Acuautla, with gunshots to the back of the head.
Tattoos of the Holy Death were found on the woman's skin, as were necklaces with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullet impacts and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a couple of men with their heads shaved and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message signed by an alleged criminal organization that said: "This happens to those who do not line up".
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied hands and feet, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while, the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Juarez Colony.
Alongside him, the agents found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of that country at the COP16 assured that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that he supports his offer to reduce for 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its emission of greenhouse gases.
China is keeping its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, he explained, in the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community on this matter.
He said China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which includes the objectives set for reducing emissions of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with state and local authorities, to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction.
In addition, various multiannual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries, abound, are underway or have already been completed.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private sector.
A provincial project on climate change is also underway, another for the change of incandescent foci for savers and one more for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific adviser on climate change, said China's efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he pointed out, China's per capita greenhouse gas emissions are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent in the last five years and plans to do the same by 2020, he said.
Attached to legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what suits his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what to his right suits.
In an interview prior to the protest by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonoran Order Commission".
"Mr Espino has the right to complain to the National Council's Order Commission, so it is a decision taken within the competence of a competent body", he noted.
He also said that it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance for the presidential candidacy was never on the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action will emerge stronger from the internal election on December 4 and 5, when his successor will be elected.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was a approach for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective", he said.
The Pan leader said that the PAN is backed by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; instead, we enjoy it and it strengthens us", he said.
He said that without a doubt the council will know how to choose the best or the best leader that requires National Action for the next three years, from there he will deliver the stafeta "to whom the council determines".
"I have that absolute calm and openness, to any of the five I would be proud to hand over the office of party president".
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the last elections on July 4 will be reflected in the next contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012. "
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task".
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a cause for observation throughout the country, hence "many hopes, longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech in the four years of his government, César Nava called on priests to reflect on the sexenios of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderon; that they start defending them; that they come out of the closet", he said.
He said the head of the federal executive could make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no gagging or censorship in the country.
Obama promotes law for undocumented students on Twitter
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and instruct them to pass this legislation", the US president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama joined the national mobilization today in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
"If you agree that passing the Dream Act is the appropriate thing, call your senators and tell them to pass this legislation", Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps open a cyberlink to a broader document asking the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote expected soon, now is the time to make your voice heard", she notes.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation unless the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other bills such as ratifying the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Questioned about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the fiscal issue is resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects can be set.
"I think there's a lot of time"...
"We all agree that we have to solve the tax issue before the end of the year"...
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest", he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a "closing vote" on the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on starting next Thursday in the Senate, though more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, which requires the participation of a handful of Republicans, at a time when pro-project organizations are waging intense lobbying to ensure the bill's passage.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Yet at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has expressed support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
So the Dream Act supporters are demanding that several Republicans be added in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most-courted Republicans are Maine senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have stated that they will not support it again.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the wound
The second round of Language Pleasures was a walk where participants celebrated the narration
"I understand that of El sexo en la lengua but... the finger in the wound? what is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Los placeres de la lengua, a cycle that celebrates Spanish literature and that this time used the subtitle of her question (in another fair the round table was dedicated to El sexo en la lengua, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "put us in trouble", the Argentine writer spat sweetly to the public, mostly young, who were invited to the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this roundtable moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
The infectious disease doctor convinces her: "Patience is not my strong suit, it may be my wound".
At the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma doctor who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar".
The protagonist sighed relieved and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very interweven.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative entitled Elogio de la invención, where the finger in the wound is not named but is discovered in a moment.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, it tells of a famous sorceress, who also touched clouds, brought back men who had gone away or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a narrative that turned to talk then America, the great novel to which from the beginning his own chroniclers did not lack to tell it and cited Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes the excesses of what was told by the conquering captains.
"The serfs who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the mock witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell America's story with the imagination that lacked even modesty".
However, he stressed that "it is the madmen and the embezzlers who best imagine" and it is where reality and lies converge, where it is no longer known which of the narrated belongs to one side or the other, where fiction literature reaches its apogee.
He calls it the "cervantes tradition".
"By his inheritance we are what we are".
In her turn, writer Mayra Montero applauded the variety of interpretations that resulted from the FIL's invitation with her round table El dedo en la llaga.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her own to the great wound of social violence that is going through her country - and Latin America - as a result of drug trafficking disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated", he said, citing that the reality of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that results in dogmatism, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a small no and behind every denial there is a small yes".
"To be masters of our thinking and masters of reality we have to nuance: and nuance often means putting your finger in the wound and annoying those people who are much more comfortable thinking in caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and annoying also the powers that prefer a world in black and white", he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already reached the decisive series three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already reached the decisive series three times, although until now he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoled by the medal of the runner-up, has stayed one step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santista strategist reached his first final as a coach in the Apertura 2002 Tournament, when he was in charge of the Morelia with which he fell by 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Clausura 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén again suffered a setback, as his team finished tied 2-2 to the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he put himself in the lead by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three players of his failed from the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 backhand.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same luck, he seeks to get rid of the evil and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he states that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to come out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for an hobby to which I owe and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important", commented the timonel when questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
The previous final is very valid, from which, he says, he has learned a lot, "the only lesson we can have is that until the referee whistles the final we can not celebrate, we are ready in the line, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were ready to run out and I think that is a lesson, until the match is over we can celebrate".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalties, something that does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "One never seeks to reach the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and we have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the fate made us a bad move, sometimes because of nerves or anxiety to have the title in our hands, but that left us, something left us for this final that we hope does not reach that instance".
Romano has it in his hands to stop being a technical runner-up and experience for the first time the glory that titles give.
US changes rules for visa
You must go to the Visa Applicant Service Centre before your interview at the Consular Section; the cost and the waiting time will be less.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for issuing visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centres (ASC) before their interview at the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, as there will be no need to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another payment for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant shall only make a lump sum payment covering all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa cases on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for business and investor visas.
Persons wishing to renew their visa do not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but only to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have their fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will stay in the Consular Section for less time than in the past.
Also, those who apply for a visa at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $ 26.

NASA to announce finding of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has called on the press to present tomorrow a finding that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it would present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures just like us in hostile environments that were once thought uninhabitable, and it would put on the table the possibility that they could become intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this ability increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benign atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will prove that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the true extent of the findings at the press conference tomorrow Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of dangerous substances
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, it leads to the arrival of 'bipartism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in Congress, led by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartidism' in the House.
Before the start of the 60th Legislature installation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo were 'throne' against the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, it starts the 'bipartism', because now two people, of equal number of parties, will control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, PRD coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice president.
Corvera Quevedo, said that with these reforms institutionally constitutes the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be overwhelmed again by both parties and with that the opposition coalition ended.
"This is where [the opposition coalition] has come, that's what I'm looking at, because we're excluded from any decision, nor do they have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest".
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patrón, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
He said that the Commission had not been able to reach a consensus on the matter.
"It is not in the spirit of the law reform that there should be an eternal bipartisanship in Congress".
To start with, this group is starting with 5 lawmakers, and they are talking to other colleagues to get more, the convergent overflowed.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress became a 'booty' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"It used to be one game, now they're splitting it up".
Patrón Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the deputy, to give him his place in the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, to be left out of 5 that probably we are going to make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated into different fractions, we have decided to unify to seek a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we are not in agreement with that reform".
$200,000 more coming out for the "supplier"
Mazatlán City Council pays another check to the questionable owner of an electrical equipment company.
A cheque for just over 200 thousand pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the Municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the State Superior Auditorate for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total still owed and, consequently, how many more checks are still to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, just being paid what is owed, like the rest of the suppliers", he said in an interview.
The last cheques "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last one on 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Gazette of the State, as the Law marks when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
The above, after on July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks that the City Council issues to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos was paid by the Municipality more than 10 million pesos, through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgent to attend tourist sites
Tourism businessmen regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor conditions of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that the image of the destination should be taken care of and reversed the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come to walk and see the mess and turn away from nearby businesses.
"Politicians don't know what it's like to close a company one day and they have no idea how much money is lost, or they wouldn't have done the work in this way in so long and without proper planning".
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it because giving preventive maintenance and not falling solely in the corrective", he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well".
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito of Mazatlán.
"Today, for the tourist to come, it does not depend only on promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions", he said.
"Not enough attention has been given and this kind of fact highlights something that is obvious to everyone, maintenance is needed".
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of Mazatlán's tourist sites is urgent, as they are not being used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be put in line with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it is tourist-oriented.
"Luckily Mazatlan offers many sites and historical and cultural sites that will have to be ordered first, cleaned and put online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination".
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A dignified and free of agreements between parties and the state Executive Legislature demands the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature has been installed, comprising seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three from the Nueva Alianza Party, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM, totalling 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require a responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Coordinating Business Council, proposed that the newly inaugurated 40 members of the State Congress take on the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
"We hope that the deputies really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties because it is customary that they make arrangements to look after their own interests and become carnival companions of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions".
He therefore called for the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to take the Governor on his turn.
"We want them to come and do a worthy job and above all committed to society and the sectors because it was the Sinaloans who gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections".
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will encourage job creation".
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight that is within the state budget to strengthen the state Tourism Secretary.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with less budget and is incongruent as an important economic activity and generator of foreign exchange and investment and that it competes directly with the agro industry".
In addition, it is necessary to label resources to tourism projects that are detonating and that help to give security to the state and to update the Alcohol Law that have not been able to solve in previous legislatures.
A magician king is sought
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the coming King's Day will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, since their home is made up of no more and no less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in the Colonia Salvador Allende and live by day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we are hard because my husband has no chamba, but we sell mandarin and potatoes... in the afternoon I go out with the 'people' to sell on the street", said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Adelaida, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old little brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests one-year-old clothes.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster,' but I told him 'let's see son,' because it was very expensive", Cayetana recalled sadly.
For older children, who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Miguel, 8, wears size eight.
José Juan, 14, is short of shoes, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a great help.
If you want to help make the dream of the Coronado Valenzuela family's children a reality you can join the Campaign Se Busca un Rey Mago, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions were carried out in the framework of the dismantling of a network for the production and sale of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized", says Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec's Security.
In total, 11 men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees were to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession with intent to traffic, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have come about after a long investigation that has lasted for almost a year.
"It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to make the arrests", Mr Ruel said.
The police operation involved about 70 agents from the Estrie investigation module of the Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department.
The fight against illegal migration will be easy
The bill by the conservatives, which the government believes should solve the problem of the clandestine migrant footsteps, will surely face a major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter".
"I am here with a party that has created the rubble you are treading", declared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow for up to one year's detention of anyone coming from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc de Québec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it targets the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the Government does", Mr Duceppe said.
NPD immigration critic Olivia Chow has rejected criticism that her party is not strong enough on illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those responsible for the clandestine slaughter of migrants, and that is what we are aiming for with another bill, C-35", says Ms Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for a minimum of one year", Ms Chow explains.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country like it's a pigsty".
"They hope that Canada will take firm action", says Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its draft law, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a Conservative told Agencia QMI that the government was going to request a vote so that every MP who opposes it would explain himself to his constituents.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Despite the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised for two days: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Consequently, Tuesday's announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Standing Council on the police services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party that deals with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit out of the woods" and "a last-minute chapuzzly solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You'll see the results when we announce it", he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem".
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for launching a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this inquiry commission, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide", he explains.
"The only way to have an inquiry commission is with Jean Charest's resignation", explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To overcome this impasse, it suggests that Quebec grant a special mandate to the intervener general to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
'We must be able to extend the mandate of the interventionist general', he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to compel individuals to testify.
The creation of a permanent gang is not the only project underway in the Charest government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better accommodate this type of crime.
This request appears to have come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this type of investigation.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in relation to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation against motorcycle gangs, although the Penal Code had not been adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently pushed for the passage of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Various waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in various regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precaution, two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has sunk.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, between 20 and 40 millimeters extra are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
As this rainfall adds to the melting of snow that has already accumulated in certain areas, there is a fear that several rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme in the Laurentides, and the Chêne in Lotbinière, have caused flooding in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon to overflow.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have washed away a temporary bridge.
As a precaution, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit is still on alert and monitoring the situation closely, according to Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Quebec Flood Forecast Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday announcing the heavy flooding of several rivers, particularly the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
They partially blame Dupont.
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Board (CCNR) for controversial statements about welfare and Haitians, as well as for his rude language on the radio.
The CCNR believes that Mr. Dupont and his team at CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on welfare, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in daytime broadcasts".
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not infringe the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint from the Common Front of People Receiving Social Assistance in Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters should report reliable data and not misleading.
In relation to the suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most Committee members have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be viewed as a solution to life's problems.
'The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner.'
Any blame has therefore been dismissed in this respect.
The last case concerned statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had been the protagonists of a media confrontation that had aroused numerous reactions.
The CHOI anchor stated that he had not made any donations to help Haitians because he could not know for sure whether those in need were actually going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect is an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there".
"My record has been clean for a year and a half", the presenter declared.
In all its decisions, the Committee denounces the broadcast of profanity.
In any case, CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences for the broadcaster will be minimal, as it will, inter alia, have to announce the decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
Montreal native of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar career.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria", explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
"In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the ground game involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America".
The athlete, who works as a security guard and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship, held October 23-30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in the kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing categories", he explained.
"I'm currently preparing to compete in the World San Shou Cup in China".
"They will invite the athletes who have finished in the top four at the last world championships in each category".
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth".
"In 2007, in China, I finished fifth, but I came third in Toronto in 2009", he added.
"The interesting thing is that I've been progressing in every competition".
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
San shou or sanda is a Chinese martial art that involves striking with the fists and feet, as well as throwing opponents to the ground.
The matches are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Even though Zemmal is only supposed to keep one competition in his career, he will definitely attend the big "King of Sanda" tournament, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is the most notorious and prestigious in China", explains the friendly boy.
"It's like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium".
"It's been an incredible experience".
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
"The one who beat me is a real professional", he thinks.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg). "
"The winners of the semi-finals face each other in the final of their category".
"Then the champions of each category will battle to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu".
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth 450 million dollars to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained the largest contract, the project management contract, for 295 million without a prior tender.
The consortium, called Énergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with the responsibility of managing this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Énergie gérance consortium was awarded the lucrative contract without a prior public tender.
The use of consortia of undertakings poses a serious ethical problem for the Québec Party, threatening to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition".
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly", said Sylvain Simard, a member of the Quebec Party, at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier this morning Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he says, he does not understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that any collusion with this contract had occurred.
"I'm getting tired", he protested, defending that the PQ had acted "dishonestly" and "lacking rigor".
He pointed out that "at the very least" the PQ should apologize.
The consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
It is usually a partnership with a time limit allowing two or more companies to pool their expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is highly complex, given the scale of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In any event, the contract was awarded without any competition being involved; it was a negotiation.
Moreover, the consortium formula is no longer the exception to the rule in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir reported last week, the formula for consortia in the technical advisory sector is being investigated by the Government.
A quick look at the Quebec Commercial Register identifies more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
Dessau thus works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Énergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that 'the James Bay territory responds to a particular labour dynamic and Hydro-Québec has responded specifically to it since the 1970s'.
The head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), gave an explanation which highlighted the fact that the project management contract was awarded directly.
"If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher".
"You have two options: you can contact the players in the sector and say to them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price".
"The idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competition of the people", Mr Laporte said.
The contract awarded to the Énergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 won by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 contracts for technical advice awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to undertakings or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Génivar has obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not taking into account its participation in Énergie gérance.
All the contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to 449,783,344 dollars, including the Énergie gérance contract of 295,131,564 dollars.
Sylvain Simard has suggested that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has indicated that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather their leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption: the 'green' label does not inspire confidence
More environmentally friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The Québec consumer hardly relies on sustainable development actors, fair trade brands or eco-certificates to guide his choices.
The situation is even worse, according to the Barometer on Responsible Consumption, whose first results were published yesterday: consumers are immersed in a media universe where messages are flooding in to advocate more responsible consumption, but they regret the lack of reliable information and consider that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called "socially responsible" products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or their environmentally friendly advertising, according to a measurement tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke's Observatory for Responsible Consumption.
Another finding: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates for products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands labeled as "eco-responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take seriously the speeches of politicians on this issue.
In any event, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, which currently supports about one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information mean that 46% of consumers reject this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecers say they also distrust the supposed returns of the ecological products or services that are being sold to them.
Moreover, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have prioritized shopping in their neighbourhood stores and have preferred to buy food products grown in their region, notes the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points out of a high of 100 this year), the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to take the recycling king's place, trying to reduce its impact on the environment by caring for the protection of wildlife.
However, according to the Barometer, this social awareness seems to be from doors (of their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebeckers indicated that they have used public transport or shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this large-scale behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex pos la Société Angus and the Parallèle, agrees to cooperate, but only by way of a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to buy back the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent from Daniel Langlois and give him back his true cinematic vocation, have not obtained what they asked for.
The government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected grant, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan which would in fact be less than the initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a request for 12.8 million last spring, but since then the requests have been revised downwards.
The President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is leading the eXcentris case, sent a proposal and an action plan to the Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you a final report about ten days ago.
However, SODEC received a counterproposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to reply to it.
In any event, it seems that the hypothesis of a State grant should be completely rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema and Cinema Complex Owners of Quebec opposed direct State investment to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, a number of representatives of the sector are calling for considerable financial aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has been responsible for the production of the cinema for ten years, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of independent film theatres is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
The company Angus and the Parallèle, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these halls, the Parallèle, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three theatres on 27 February, showing the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the dismissal proposals they have received.
The veil of Canada is lifted...
New US diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the US sees as the Canadian complex with respect to the Americans, but at the same time reflect the latter's feeling of superiority towards Canada.
American diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don't think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the Conservative government get its budget passed in 2009!
The four new communications between the US embassies in Ottawa and Washington that were made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, during the federal election campaign, reports how far the United States does not get into the issues debated by political leaders.
This came as a great surprise to the American ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex practically inherent in Canadians when dealing with everyday domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign)", he writes.
Thus, he concludes, the United States is "the proverbial elephant of this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too dangerous to talk about".
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this "deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, he thinks, the ability of a candidate, of a party and, even more so, of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting".
This sense of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, the business manager in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will help ensure the government's survival during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, whereby Canada will record its first deficit in a decade due to a $30 billion to $40 billion recovery plan", writes Mr. Breese.
Nowhere is there any mention of the government having to extend parliament before Christmas to prevent it being replaced by a coalition, or of the opposition parties having their survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins warns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the dramatic series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, which make subtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even kidnappings for the CIA to carry out vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied that he did, but that it depended "on a case-by-case basis".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "he has delivered a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin".
"The Secretary has agreed to review the file".
Finally, we can mention that the mood has warmed up in relation to the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, stated on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be "assassinated".
In America, they're echoing Mike Huckabee.
A global plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) by an amount that corresponds to almost one third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the planet's climate before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of a series of major concrete projects which the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in the industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still control between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluorescent light bulbs or, even better, by light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emitted on the planet to light humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That's equivalent to 70% of the emissions from the planet's car fleet.
At Copenhagen last year, the major emitter countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that would reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be reduced to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees Celsius to avoid it being uncontrolled.
In incandescent bulbs, 95 percent of the energy is dissipated as heat and the remaining 5 percent, or light, is produced.
In the case of fluorescent light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by a further twofold.
Fluorescent light bulbs last an average of between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives us an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be implemented in 100 countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
On top, they contain no mercury.
Various specialists have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs, since they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report says, the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluorescent light bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity wasted by incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, such plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages that this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power stations, which would cost 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast eagerly awaits the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce provisional results immediately", says a spokesman for the UN chief.
"It asks all parties in Côte d'Ivoire and the institutions to show their sense of responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced".
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline of Wednesday to midnight to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday's ballot.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CIS president had told television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were many calls for the CIS to finally announce the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, Gbagbo's side is counting on the annulment by the Constitutional Council of the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the old rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director for the president of Côte d'Ivoire, has said that the FN's intimidation of voters in the north of the country had dissuaded the outgoing president's supporters from going to vote.
The whole election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
Now, Gbagbo's opponents consider the country's highest court not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any ties to the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that submitting a complaint to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the election commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have put the finishing touches on the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided into two for years.
The United Nations warned the political class of Côte d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on 31 October, with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) data published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of unemployed persons in mainland France remains at 2,631,000.
The data for the second quarter were confirmed, with 9.3% of the active population on the mainland and 9.7% in the OCTs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has increased by 0.1 percentage points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available in the two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for work.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with the unemployment rate rising again to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOM.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ILO sense.
Unemployment among the elderly rose slightly to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points in both three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 over 50 years, rising to 6.6% in the DOM.
Only among people aged 25 to 49 years unemployment has remained stable, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
The Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate since 2006 following a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, is still doing so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the Bouches-du-Rhône General Council, is under investigation and has been imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for abuse of social goods, misappropriation of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, influence peddling and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini will fight and answer all the questions the magistrate asks, not ghosts".
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, but it is another thing to prove them", his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before her client's appearance.
Mr Guérini, brother of the leader of the PS in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted to send a document to the judge, through his lawyers, before his appearance, to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of his close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, all your client has done is take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to Simon.
In the framework of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Aubagne urban agglomeration services, has also been investigated since Wednesday for money laundering and complicity, but has been released on parole and is prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have been reproached him".
"The investigating magistrate has taken the explanations into account and has released him", explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Tuesday night, four people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the deputy prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy general manager of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with "influence trafficking and passive corruption".
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been questioned for "subtraction and malversion of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in the malversion of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's partner Jeannie Peretti is being investigated for "covering up the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have confronted Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Investigators suspect their companies are serving to launder the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications alleging fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the investigation points out that the investigations are concentrated especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for "espionage", has stunned the public in France, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of American diplomats.
The US documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elisha has explained his strategy to the Americans to the point of giving them advice on managing their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French woman did not come in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by US justice for trafficking materials for Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the impression that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
He didn't really do anything.
A diplomatic cable drafted on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on the handling of hostage cases".
The Elysée's adviser on strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Quai d'Orsay's director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, are speaking with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly held in Iran.
"Make noise", they say, "shout continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights", "innocency", "immediate release".
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it even more often".
Because, once the attempts at negotiation through discreet channels are exhausted, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "experts in delaying maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a common Iranian tactic: hostage-taking for political blackmail".
He announced that Clotilde Reiss' release from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day she will take refuge in the French embassy) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros in reward).
Furthermore, he notes that Elisha anticipates further hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran", he says.
August 28th, 2009
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but she is locked up in Iran.
The following information is being circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being sought by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge's decision.
The American embassy, like many observers, doubts this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which closes in on Iran's clandestine networks of procurement for nuclear weapons, Majid Khakavand's release is bad news.
Has France accepted a trade?
Release the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
Elisha, he claims, not only "has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision", but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the judicial decision", he says.
Mr Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand is still under the "close" surveillance of the French intelligence services.
Elisha's adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in a building in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elisha did not spare efforts, using organised press releases and "leaks" in the media to make it appear that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity with a certain irony and see that the manipulation is paying off, since several press articles convey the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media blitz by French officials".
Why such "gratitude" to Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
"Despite their praise-filled statements, French officials privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done".
The document then discusses the reasons that led Elisha to create this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria", he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critics in France and abroad, had just been branded premature and undeserved".
By "exaggerating the Syrian role", Paris is trying to "show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran".
The American embassy knows from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not".
"But anyway, we thanked you".
"At least this should cause confusion among Iranians".
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives you at the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for playing an "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
After midnight, Korean youths can't play online games
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called "Cinderella" that will prevent teenagers from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight for young people under 16, according to representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day".
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep", said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the law's implementation, he said.
The government is also planning to ask companies to limit the time of daily access to these games when the parents of young people so request, the official added.
It will also make available free computer programs that limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts linked to heavy Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of the world's online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced off against 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA names the host countries
Amidst the storm caused by corruption suspicions, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday designates the host countries for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political election where influence struggles and lobbying can come to dominate over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implementation in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) testifies to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
The back-office transactions, therefore, may take until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) candidates have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not carry much weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee when voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the birthplace of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added fuel to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has highlighted three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to displease FIFA and shame the English officials, who have launched an intense lobbying campaign in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Prime Minister hopes to repeat the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had won the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's glow to the EC?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has many strengths thanks to their stadiums, already ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undermine their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, all they get is to give points to Russia, which has become a weighty outsider despite the gaps in its candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote", in a direct reference to the accusations of the English press against EC members.
"They are putting on their dirty clothes, trying to compromise them", Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems the most logical favourite.
The country, the world's leading economic power and home to FIFA's main sponsors, seems to have an advantage over Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that have jointly hosted the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the concession of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances for 2022.
Alongside Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion towards new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (based on time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had indicated that he doubted.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no doubt whatsoever.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less so.
One mandate on the Elisha leads to another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate again in 2012.
However, the evidence for this does not fit well with the mystery that is often associated with the office of the presidency.
So you always have to pretend you doubt.
One way and the other.
In 2006, believe it or not, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "some time in the autumn of 2011".
So the fact that he is dealing with the UMP deputies, on Tuesday night in the Elíseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some stir.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much of a problem.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
I was simply conveying the facts, not an announcement.
This isn't the first time he's talked about the presidential race, in a funny way, in meetings like this.
"In the worst, or best, case, you'll still spend seven and a half years with me", he had released in July 2009.
Another time, in May 2010, he said: "Don't think I don't think about what's coming next".
Your statements the day before yesterday do not bring you any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They arouse comment for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has come to the fore that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Rather the opposite; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many people from the PS to claim that the battle is organized earlier than planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer the candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the subject", the Prime Minister's entourage reacted immediately and prudently.
"If he thinks he can lose, he will not be a candidate", says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always think he can win", Alain Juppé corrects, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: ECB forced to keep its purchases of government bonds
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow for the details of the way out of the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the discontinuation of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations which should be completed by the end of the year.
The Frankfurt Institute will certainly not be able to afford to be so peremptory because of the European sovereign debt crisis if it does not want to risk aggravating a situation which is now more than complicated on the European bond markets.
The political cost would be just as high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde endorsed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in the European States.
He did not say whether he thought the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its programme for purchasing government bonds.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans"....
The ECB President, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not more eloquent in his intentions during his hearing in Brussels yesterday before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, merely stating that the programme for purchasing government bonds on the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we decide" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that is clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's purchases of Treasury bonds have doubled in the past week to about €1.35 billion.
Moreover, according to the indiscreet market players, he would have bought Irish and Portuguese bonds again yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased securities worth EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Nor do economists foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although the ECB has now dropped its lending operations over three months, it still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on favourable terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a regulation.
"I can't imagine you're going to change your program considerably".
"Otherwise, there is a risk of new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a gradual exit will occur during the first quarter of 2011", said Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
I'm going to Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a purchasing volume of such bonds in order to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to the euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuer has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
'It must compensate for the lack of investors in the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent a marked increase in the yields paid by the most fragile States,' said a major bond manager yesterday.
Because if interest rates go through the roof, governments will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is facing a storm
After Italy started the week in a disturbing way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the rebound in 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the outset of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have affirmed that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indescipherable" and that an "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any event, on Tuesday the difference with German long-term rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy risk cover contracts (CRQ) had soared to 263 points, causing some fuss in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that in Spain the difference with German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, expressed "deep concern" about "turbulence in the markets" and a possible spread from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland".
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal", explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, the problem is lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which means that the State runs the risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a watershed moment for the government.
Italy's growth is estimated to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to the 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour that new budget provisions may be implemented after the holidays, amounting to EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be adopted", says Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of the international institutions.
"The foundations of your economy are in order and your accounts are in good shape, as we have been saying for some time", says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or long term, because despite its considerable debt (119,2% of GDP in 2011), the stabilization efforts required of Italy are smaller than those required of other countries", says Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
There is the problem of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period would be opened which would not be conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening crisis management mechanisms
Christine Lagarde, speaking at a press conference in Paris yesterday, said: 'I think we have already shown on Sunday night and day that Europeans are clearly in solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area.
The relative easing of European sovereign bond rates yesterday has given a boost to governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet speak of a principle of standardisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it might downgrade Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target of speculation at present.
"Like in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems", say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political pace is much slower than the market pace".
Aware of this gap and the dangers it entails, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing mechanisms for overcoming the crisis.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly concerned and, in general, with their G20 counterparts are well under way.
And this is also in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, has embarked on a tour of Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the latest developments in Europe's financial crisis.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, they certainly set the stage.
The first issues of EFSF bonds are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the US would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The countries in the forefront, Portugal and Spain, are preparing for structural reforms, particularly in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms are in addition to the more effective austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move forward on a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both want to avoid at all costs seeking international aid before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider indispensable to build confidence in a lasting way.
Finally, the capitalist partners of the European funds are considering the options available to accelerate the process of normalising the public bond markets.
On 24 November, in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to withdraw the money.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, consider that an additional amount of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
The instrument for this is the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60 billion.
A council which could undoubtedly examine European capitals in detail.
Especially if market conditions worsen.
Snow and ice: 24 apartments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause difficulties for traffic, especially on the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have joined the 20 departments already on orange alert, 18 from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfall is affecting the north of Gironde and Charentes, although there is also light snow on Île de France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm, occasionally between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments concerned are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Lower Normandy, Île-de-France and Limousin.
Snowfall is strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, heavy vehicles over 7.5 tonnes are prohibited from several departmental roads, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, traffic on the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of necessity and the circulation of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transportation has been banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned for Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture "urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly on Thursday because of the snowfall.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick airport, south of London, and Edinburgh airport, in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
The Grand Paris Metro: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport on the Île de France has reached its peak, billions have fallen.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, which the Société du Grand Paris must build.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a funding allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In theory, this amount will enable the SGP to subsequently obtain loans on the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 amending finance bill, which was considered in the National Assembly's finance committee this morning, contains the provisions for finding the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the Île de France.
The first, as we read in Article 15 of the text of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The proceeds of this tax are 117 million euros a year".
The second is an amendment to an existing office tax "to modernise it, increase its output and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
The text does not give figures.
But it's far from 4 billion.
'It is specified that the tax resources are added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds to be mobilised by the State and to be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses', we read in the explanatory memorandum.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the moment that income is created (the two taxes), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explained".
'It shall be recorded in the budget and used on the basis of needs.'
The SGP estimates that it will start receiving the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the four billion promised are not included in the credit, may provoke a slightly inflamed parliamentary debate.
The first public hearing will be on 7 December.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal which only seems scandalous in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
It also predicts profound changes on an international scale and a future dominated by regression.
But let's take it one step at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every dossier created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is made up exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" US revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except Berlusconi's) and Gaddafi's sinisterly ridiculous profile has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of publicly known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you visit a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do new research (or do not know where to look for news about the nonexistent), but because those engaged in occultism do not just trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same applies to the secret files.
The informant is lazy, just as the head of the secret service (if he could not be, I don't know, editor of Libération) is lazy (or has little eagerness), who only considers true what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome was sending to the State Department was the same as that published by Newsweek the week before.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they are merely saying what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the Second World War and since Heads of State can make phone calls or catch a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited exercises of representation, have been transformed into centres of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows this perfectly well, we just pretend we don't know it out of hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly is a breach of duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image to American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker could access the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world greatly affects the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the 'doers'.
But let's get into the true nature of what happened.
In the old days, in Orwell's time, you could think of yourself as a big brother who controlled every move of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, every hotel visited, every highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as is happening now, that even the crypts of power's secrets cannot escape a hacker's control, the relationship of control ceases to be one-way and becomes circular again.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the avenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power be held back if it can no longer keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is in fact an empty secret, without any secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means to take away all her power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound inflicted on such a powerful power?
It is clear that in the future the Member States will no longer be able to put any confidential information on the net, as it would be like putting it on a street sign.
But it is also evident that, with today's technology, you cannot expect to have confidential conversations over the telephone.
Nothing is easier than discovering whether and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of his counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly well that, at the moment, my prediction is science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in stagecoaches with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been memorized or, at best, hiding some data written in the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: after all, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I've written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, which is to say, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a wired telegraph.
Video tapes (analog) had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, going forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, whereas now CDs (digital) only allow to go forward or backward from chapter to chapter, that is, in enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, with the travel it entails, it takes three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication techniques to bring us back to horse-drawn carriages.
One last comment.
In the past, the press tried to understand what was going on in the embassies in secret.
Today, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France's financial promises are lacking
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the promises of rapidly unlocked financing (called fast start) made by developed countries have been met.
And the French bags have been uncovered.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed EUR 7.2 billion over three years and France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures taken by its Member States, a press conference, a major complementary event, the distribution of leaflets...
The transparency operation was a good result and was appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to meet its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be 'new and additional' to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference the year 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million is added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of 'all new projects' in 2010 is 'new and additional'.
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of aid from France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) as long as it aims to respect its commitment to 'new and additional' funds...
Another crucial element is the distribution of grants and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the calculation method.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro lent is equal to one euro donated.
Of course, it is difficult to justify such an effort: it is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects related to reducing emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is false to present a euro that is to be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... At most, only the cost of the loan to the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate) should be calculated for its commitments.
But France does not find this useful: it "meets" its 420 million euro commitment by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it at 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia, among others, meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, whereas the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France contributes only ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
That's a good trick!
In short, France is abusing its fast start financing in two ways: first, in relation to actions in time and, second, in relation to the actual financial effort.
Spending only 36.1 million euros, it gives the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that Bercy has taken care of the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not stupid...
The early financing chapter is a small detail, relatively short-term, in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope not.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early financing.
First, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of meeting its commitments and in the same way as the other EU countries.
But France in particular could move the debate on the stakes in longterm financing forward (another essential chapter currently being discussed): we will not get rid of the question of the 'additional nature' or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore have hope for the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and its view on the 'additional nature' and use of the loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old child ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study released Wednesday by the association Generations Futures (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problematic treatment", purchased in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the food that is usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and a snack a day.
These model meals, which comply with official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three parts of dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as the sweets, were tested in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies by various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Although in virtually all cases the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic and/or PE pollutants is of concern", the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogenic residues and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can damage the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil and intended as a school snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenyan green beans, included in food, in which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even bread or gum were laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the tests revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon stew was the most "nutritious" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk posed by these "pollutant cocktails" to the consumer "is probably underestimated", says the study.
The European Ecology-Green Alliance (EE-LV) has proposed, "in view of the gravity of the situation", a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
