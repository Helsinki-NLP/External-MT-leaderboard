John Edward: Linguistics for the public
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained their best-ever results in 2018, with excellent academic results in sports, engineering, literature and community support.
There are over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, and their schools are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Association, which focuses on providing quality support to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education and life-long commitment to becoming international citizens.
We see modern languages as a preferred subject in schools as a constituent and actionable learning community.
Nelson Mandela: When you speak in a language that people understand, it goes into their head.
If you speak in his language, you are interfering with his interests.
It reminds us that we shouldn't just use English to connect with other countries.
The Doha Independent Schools' curriculum results have the highest graduation rate in language courses.
68% of foreign language learners score in the column.
Data from 74 Scottish Independent Schools Association schools showed that 72% of pupils scored highly in the Chinese language column, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
This indicates that the spread of foreign languages in independent schools in Scotland is a key skill for future students and young people.
Languages are now taught as optional subjects in independent schools and other institutions, unlike science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
In a 2014 UK Labour and Skills Council study, 17% of unfilled vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for the future.
Language skills are a global problem because of the many opportunities for language skills.
Regardless of your life choice, knowing a second language can be beneficial in the long run.
When it comes to communicating directly with strangers, a multilingual person naturally gets ahead of the competition.
According to the 2013 UK census, 75% of the 4,000 people in the UK were unable to communicate because they were not foreign-speaking, and only 15% could speak French.
So it's important to invest in language learning for today's children.
In contrast, children are more likely to be enslaved in developing economies where there are more languages.
Scottish schools have a variety of languages of instruction.
Some schools focus on the former languages, while others focus on the UK in 2020 with the most important languages like Chinese and Japanese.
Depending on your child's interests, the language is optional in independent schools, and the teachers are skilled in the language.
The academic environment in Scottish independent schools also focuses on providing children with skills that are important for the future.
It is recognized that languages will be important in the future of the country in the global business environment, and it should be included in the education sector.
So think of modern languages as a global communication skill.
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with choice, diversity and opportunity.
Keep doing it.
John Edvard is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Association.

North Korea says it will not reduce troops on one side without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister, Sun Jae-in, said that the uncertainty caused by the UN sanctions would not leave a legacy of nuclear weapons in such a scenario.
Last year, the Ra's Party said North Korea had done a lot of good things, including nuclear testing, destroying test sites, and promising not to develop nuclear weapons and equipment.
He said that there was no information or confirmation from the US side.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and we will not lose the first army in such a situation.
According to Rye, North Korea has repeatedly denied the allegations made at Alton and has pledged to denuclearize.
According to Ri, during the first meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US Prime Minister Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12, Kim pledged to disarm and Krump said he would help North Korea's security.
North Korea was keen to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States also urged Beijing to dismantle its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused to obey the North Korean ban.
The United States has repeatedly called for nuclear disarmament first, increased sanctions, and refused to end the Korean War, Hill said.
There is a hindrance to our hearing them.
The failure is due to continuous blocking, which is unreliable.
Kim Jong-un and Cha said nothing about the plans for a second meeting, as U.N. officials said in Ra's last week.
The minister mentioned three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months. If the issue of nuclear annihilation were to be resolved with South Korea rather than the United States, the problem would not be so serious.
Rai's comments differed from those made at the UN last year, where he said that the international community was unlikely to believe that North Korea's launch of a U.S. rocket was a suicide attempt by a mischievous president, who called Kim a suicide bomber.
At the Doha World Summit, Trump called for the destruction of North Korea, but vowed to denuclearize it, and praised the holiday, saying sanctions should remain in place until disarmament.
The bird says, "I don't have time for this, it doesn't matter if it's two years, three years, five months".

Pompeo's U.S. counterpart in the mountains and the World Summit, he told Pivot that he would also go next month for the summit's negotiations.
The Pompidou made three trips to North Korea in the same year, the last of which was not a success.
He returned from Beijing in July, at the insistence of North Korea.

At Harbert, students are taught lessons about rest.
A new course at Harvard University is designed to give students more sleep time, which is more likely to be viewing text instead of sleeping.
The university said that when asked about the self-management of the top universities in the world, it did not have time to think about it.
Dr. Charles C. Siler, from the Harvard School of Medicine and the Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the course, which he claims is the first of its kind in the United States.
The initial study was inspired by reports of learning disorders caused by sleep.
Finally, he came to me and said, 'Why don't you tell me about it at the end of the year?'
"I am surprised that no one has told anyone about my sleep", she told his telegraph.
The class is a start-up, and the students are taught about the benefits of sleep and exercise in everyday life.
Dr. Paul Shereya, a psychiatrist and director of the Habbat Medical School, said the decision to start the class was made after a week of learning about the poor performance of two students.
They are the first steps in the interaction of a single lesson.
In one group, students in a room had pictures of coffee mugs, jelly machines, and books, and talked about the dangers of caffeine, fire, and the dangers of sports betting, and the importance of staying up late.
The participants in each group were shown to be at increased risk of heart disease, heart disease, cancer, and other diseases if they were not sleeping for long periods of time.
Interactive icons on a regional map make participants think about their daily routines.
We know that students don't change their behavior overnight.
But it's just as important for them to know that smoking is harmful to our bodies as it is for us to know that smoking is harmful to our bodies".
The tradition of night owls has become very popular, he said, adding that modern technology and the pressure on students are causing them to lose sleep.
He said that sleep is the secret tool for students to get rid of anxiety and depression, and that if you don't get enough sleep, your brain is hungry and tired, so sleeping in a good way prevents you from losing weight.
19-year-old Raymond, a California native who is studying chemical and biological engineering, and a first-year student at Harvard in his previous year, helped him organize his program at Pfizer.
He said the program opened his eyes and inspired him to spread the word throughout the region.
His hope is to encourage undergraduate students to study the program before joining a competitive organization.
Porphyr Zeller also pointed out that students need to be alerted to go to bed and wake up early, and that green light from technology and LED lights can cause sleep disruption.
Leaving Aston 1-0 Rangers, Gerrard of Manning
Liverpool's 1-0 defeat at home to St. Benegard's side in Doleman's home game forced Rangers to take another shot.
Eiborg was on the verge of recording his first win after a 4-1 win over Aston Villa in St John's on 2 February, but he was forced to leave Ladbroke Premier League side Shrewsbury Harbour after a second attack from Gerrard in the Greyhounds' 18th game, and the manager gave him eight free throws.

Alfredo Morelos was forced to face Estébanolles in the 45th minute, but he was forced to cancel the Colombian bid.
Only two half-strokes were possible on the wing, with former Ivory goalkeeper Liam Caley using Lasagna's head and Obi-Zari's bat.
The opening of Levi's 34 Stars seemed to be a game-changer, but everyone felt their efforts were worth it.
Again, the surface of the canvas is not aligned with Jacob's deepest arrangement.
DeClaglar's leg was given to Scott Robinson, but he was unresponsive from Ashfield, and Scott Robinson was still in the process of choosing a smoother end.
At half-time, a quick sideline play by Ryan Kent, who replaced Gerard's Qualleballey, gave Morelos a chance, but stopped Kelley's run at the boundary line.
However, Leebing Aston's Lygga and Halcythe, along with the ever-exciting game of football, built a long-distance footpath and kept visitors enthusiastic about the game.
Holt's side managed to take the lead in the final stage, but gave Jacob an unconditional pass before he headed over the edge of the ice from McGregor's side.
In exchange for the rights to the estate, Glenrothes was offered the right to reinstate his rights, as punishment for his quarrel with Jacob, but Thomas refused the offer.

The unkempt Johnny English hat with its protruding eyes and shadowy face has been restored twice, and its name tag also makes it a humorous look for non-English-speaking viewers of the border.
In fact, he is a secret agent, famous for his spanking, and for his Colosseum behavior and some of the look and behavior of Mr. Turbin at the 2012 London Motorcycle Olympics opening ceremony.

Atkinson's snake humor is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it is also seen in the more important films 007 and Mischami Poseidon.
