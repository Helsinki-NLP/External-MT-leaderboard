This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered in feathers, an already widely held hypothesis, but it provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on top, with a light orange color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insight into how birds' feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed axis called the rahis but exhibit other characteristic feather elements  beard and beard, researchers have concluded that the rahis was probably an evolutionary development that appeared after the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression, and the researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather rather than chicken down.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather rather than the plumage of a chick.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.

The work submitted was largely theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observations of the Arrow galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by tidal forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy like some kind of aura and is made up of a lot of small particles.

Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a less technical experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put in an envelope a sheet of paper that they have printed out beforehand, indicating which candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the ballot.

Candidates can send representatives to witness all stages of the process. in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Although three people were inside the house when the car hit her, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed until emergency services pulled the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She was being held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be tampered with because her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of prosecution, has told reporters that it will not make any further comment at least until the charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn on the basis of the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that, after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence for only a period of five years.
The hunters who took part in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters, and the test monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Hunters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Hunters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt have received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), made up of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to steer the country toward new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which should have taken place as early as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (MECI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were "not serious".
The minister responded, saying that Apple's delay was "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, along with Filipino photographs.
Later, photographs took the place of an elderly woman who needed the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She studied obstetrics and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began in his spare time to research preterm labor.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetus' lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also paid a tribute to the moon.
Tommy Dreamer said that Moon was the first Queen of Extremes, my first manager, and that Moon died in the night of her second birthday, a unique moment, like she was, a strong woman.
Dustin Runnels, nicknamed "Golden Dust", commented that "The Moon was as eccentric as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
From 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% from 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her view Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II ends.
34% of those interviewed agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the end of the poll, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games in the 100m and 200m freestyle events as well as three relay events, but his fitness was questioned because of his complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary pain medication, which was banned during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using different combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the earth's water supply, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political gibberish and nonsense".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and decreasing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar systems, to enable air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional means of transport are available, the surface trains do not stop at Wembley and parking and public transport related parking facilities are not available in the area.
Fears about lack of transportation raised the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, in the absence of team supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's tapeworm, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus tapeworm, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns, rolled into tiny objects.
It can be drawn into thin wires that can be twisted and braided, beaten with a hammer, or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued over other metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two powders together, and then, with clean, wet hands, form a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange sensation and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every home, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman world, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women shared.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're doing it through a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, 100 feet high, to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them, we have several medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging felines) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche; each cat has its own role to play, so it is not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
The females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals with surprisingly similar behavior to lions (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, or birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than this one.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing the ground to find it.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and move about undetected, and they hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then jumping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out (i.e., expel from the lungs).
Plants produce their food from the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 blade-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which meant that nothing that came in its way could get away with it.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other Mosasaurian species, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that gets into the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have faced it.
While most of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a peach.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets where they sat on their side while eating.
Ancient Rome's cuisine could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to the priests.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurates were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary dedicated to the god.
In the hot Middle Eastern climate, the home was less important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized, and in the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever he discovered, Eskimo tribes were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all Scandinavian countries, there were many differences in population, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has something written on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The words on the back of the Declaration of Independence read: The original Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that in its early days the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was kept in a scroll.
So the marking was probably just for labeling.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
Within two weeks, American forces along with the Free French had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, being related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress being its sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to overturn laws and tax rates between states.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is ranked second in the world's most successful teams and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is geographically an archipelago.
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and hiring Chinese workers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signs the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusingly, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore declared to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, much abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common mortal.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether the principle was really being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated the provisions of generally accepted international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar response to its unbridled submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifist and isolationist.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different periods of time; each stage of China or each family holding power represented a distinct dynasty.
Periods between successive dynasties were also marked by divided provinces, the best known such interval being the Three Kingdoms Period, over the 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belonged to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
So was the military, because instead of the military hierarchy based on class, now it was based on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things that transcended the worldly, and he used to go often to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Noor (light) Mountain.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists.
The only things you can see are the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, houses several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a series of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, caves, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward mark looks like a V, and the downward mark looks like a box or square missing the bottom side.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the side where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
A bowstroke up usually generates a softer sound, while a bowstroke down is stronger and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own directions, but remember that the printed directions for the arrow points are there for musical reasons and normally, must be respected.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a mob of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the windows of the carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles before the frightened eyes of the queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to bear much of the expenses and interest on the bonds placed in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages, representing the era in European history that spanned the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 CE).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an associated logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside cultural and political influence, and that technology, in turn, has effects on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
A high number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place they occupied in society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders returned loaded with gifts such as silks and spices more precious than what the Byzantine markets offered.
This was the moment when the title of the Fashion Capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years old.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel set apart by society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Such children are called untamed or savage.Some savage children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to rejection by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some are thought to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The wild child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (within its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffold goes a little further.
The scaffolding or construction method is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scales can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scales, but so is the little pin man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schemas are included in the software, and are designed to ask questions, provide clues and explain procedures that might otherwise be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment that lacks food, love and education, but there are.
We see the family care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our family care system must provide safe housing, caring caregivers, solid education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of the children that were not met in the home they were in before.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The Internet's other distinctive features bring additional dimensions to the approach to usage types and satisfaction.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reactions to websites.
Using video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of variations expressed.
Separation and recombination cause each generation to have one or the other of the two gene pool dominate the direction of variation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: slow growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest but also provides high amounts of protein that contains all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to the chimpanzees in the savannahs today.
Sleep interruption is the procedure whereby you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep period to fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a state of consciousness without fully waking you.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can reach enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but with the addition of the Mahayana way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The basic tenets of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, it's about Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, whereby by visualizing the different deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries becoming estranged.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and it was to be fought seriously, by delegated armies, on battlefields stretching from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
The plans were rendered useless almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers were mobilized to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting both goods and people across oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the more notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to home to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing places, usually in the care of goats that were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheep herders.
Wagonway roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks arranged in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more irregular roads of the time.
Crosses were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, however, gradually it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became common practice, but iron led to faster wear of the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning straight man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not usually walk upright.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we don't want a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problem and we should disable it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are even greater now because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten envelope, signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as Dunlap posters.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 Dunlap posters still extant are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But in birds, you can still see many dinosaur-like features.
They have scaled legs and claws, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values, 0 or 1, and the name of these numbers is binary digits or bits, in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Refer to the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term nandac is used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the old analogy with bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bedbugs are nest-dwelling, adapted to life in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of the child.
These couples can choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method, which is used in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers made extensive use of classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas about all aspects of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Your body clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence to support the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They actually have two experiments marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organised around nature exploration attracts interested persons to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying ecosystem information.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small villages in the countryside to their jobs, passing by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a private car-based transportation system.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or with collapsing bridges are rare in developed countries.
Why do transport systems cause such discontent, why do they fail every day? Is it because transport engineers are simply incompetent? Or is something worse going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
The study of traffic flow is unfortunately difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to remain within reasonable constants; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and operating road installations.
Insects were the first animals to begin to fly, and their ability to fly allowed them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates for mating much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; namely, that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide in places.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers long and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical construction craftsmanship.
Ancient Egyptians living during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which were already over a thousand years old at that time.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by most of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known since ancient times about some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are quite easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements.
He was more reminiscent of the four states of matter, (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theorized that it also transforms into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You'll see that some alloys can also contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, trillions could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a friend to many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing devices have appeared, the pencil has lost its status and its number of uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to put their hands on a sharpener.
You can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick at the near side and 100 km thick at the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker in higher elevation areas.
There might be more of the sea nearby because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on identifying the elements that attract people's attention or pleasure.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into maturity.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment can determine whether or not they do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people become unrecognizable individuals who believe they need to change everything the team has done and do it their way.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
Often, this behavior leads to a rift between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often have the role of providing a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports. Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be freely manifested.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works as a unit to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process for meeting customer needs.
Before an organisation can innovate, its leadership must create an organisational culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data is physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such allows the research area to be narrowed and defined more precisely.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes that go on in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important part of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, but has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology provides the solution with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while in class.
Virtual sharing of a field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, and the previous versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's written expression. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, having an audience generally has the gift of changing the situation.
Since student students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer begins to make efforts to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging  also forces students to be more aware of the world around them.  The need to respond to their audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their studies far beyond the regular school day.
The appropriate use of blogs  can help students think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka County and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Larger portions further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a comparison between populations that has the gift of surprising many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a truly independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered to the north by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's okay to wear a ring, but don't look expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what can be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be stalked, handcuffed, etc.
Be firm when you say no to a man and don't be afraid to stick to your position (cultural differences or not, it's still not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marines, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755, following an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of trinkets, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets of the settlement, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place, visits outside the city require an informational effort to understand the current state of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo Volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trail trips in Africa.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the danger posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities as it has a more Arab than African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The name Hong Kong Territory is given by the island of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists regard as the focal point.
The exhibition of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing bar diagram that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon, across the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is packed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonizers took over, and so for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, stretching for 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about one third is mostly covered by water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (over the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses that connect districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 No) or Punakha (200 No).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With its two pylons rising to a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two bands of 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region also hosted other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors encountered its indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has struggled to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, see Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), the value of which is fixed as the equivalent of 1 pound sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on the Outer Islands, although they will probably receive British and US currency; contact the owners in advance to find out what payment methods they accept.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland pounds outside the country, so you have to exchange them before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, there is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures often reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived chill more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must keep at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meter away from other wildlife!
As tame as they may seem, bison, deer, bear, and almost all other large animals can attack humans.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep the right distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them space.
Also, be careful that odors may attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be wise to avoid strong-smelling foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a memorable naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau-organized independence struggle, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the assassination of Tupua supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland's location between two harbours.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), located on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the market towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with a wide array of shops arranged along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
You can find a lot of French wines, but New Zealand or Australian would be better.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're worried you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of flat white coffee is unusual: a short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards, the fruit juices are peppered for the price, but very good.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from either cause are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep your booking if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on site, and most attendees consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you're gonna have to get there early to catch a campsite close to the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages has ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be careful about the location of your cabin, as navigating through the ice produces an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruise ships from Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city.
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers and the money they spend.
They usually have special food, drink and entertainment offers to keep the mood up and guests staying in the venue.
Some clubs offer alcohol on the house, but drunkenness affects judgment, and good gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Drivers driving at high latitudes or through mountain passes must consider the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short period of time, there may be enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or viscolithic snow or condensation, or the formation of ice on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably Africa's top tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to land journeys undertaken to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially those of the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for a good view of them.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a bushwalk, safari walk, or walk) consists of hikes, either of several hours or of several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your 2020 airline tickets and accommodation before the postponement is announced, you may be facing a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but in late March, the coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in your room.
If you don't have an iron or don't like wearing ironed stockings, then you can try using a hairdryer if you have one on hand.
Be careful not to allow the material to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes more.
Filters vary in their efficiency levels, and if you're worried, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation, or in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a human using physical force are not generally considered harmful.
Duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers who are about to visit countries with high taxes can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, often traversing isolated and unimproved areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, do not lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves predominate.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important to strictly adhere to them.
However, quite bizarrely, mobile phone service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is quite rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is common, with apples being used year-round and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, nuts and other nuts.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be dry or liquid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without other qualifiers, however, the term tends to indicate food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of simple spicy dishes, with the predominant tastes preferred by Javanese being peanuts, hot peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavored spices.
The stairs support the rider's legs, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety concerns because a rider's legs may become stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the saddle but has one leg caught in the ladder, the horse may drag him along as he pursues.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a high heel and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the ladder straps to detach from the saddle if pulled back by a rider falling off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after climbing site in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Snow-diving sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down on snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who organize their entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is extremely old -- we have cave paintings of skiers as far back as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened Australia's first recreational ski club.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called unmarked skiing, touring skiing or ski hiking.
It is a related activity, but which does not usually involve alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking  but very rarely will you be able to reach typical cross-country ski speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, traveling through several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this respect, the Schengen Area is organised in a way that is like a single country.
As long as you are in this area, you can generally cross the borders without having to go through passport control points.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen Member States separately, thus saving time, money and documents to obtain.
There is no universal definition of what products are antiques, and some tax agencies consider antiques to be goods that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft products can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other professions.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population have been involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi have modern occupations. Tourism is an important source of income for the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and a misperception of the Roma population.
If the country you are about to visit is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult advice from governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified manner, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is an umbrella term used for any type of hazardous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and come in many forms, depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, thunderstorms and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks that may affect their travel plans.
It is advisable that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone receive professional training.
An Internet search for "Hostile Environment Course" will probably give you the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through hands-on experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wild, but few on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
The openness of governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the gender (X) is not stated or documents updated to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies equally.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to undergo scans without their privacy and dignity being affected.
Return currents are the flow back to the ocean from waves that break on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a rapid current can form to the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in trying to swim backwards against the current, which may prove impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than it normally is.
Try to head towards a position where you're not caught again, and depending on your skills and whether or not anyone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
Homecoming shock is more rapid than culture shock (it lasts less from the euphoria of the honeymoon), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have particular difficulties in re-adjusting to their native culture.
If you return home after living abroad, you will have already adapted to the new culture and will have lost your way of life.
When you first moved to a new country, people were likely patient and understanding, aware that visiting a new country involves an adjustment process.
The world does not always expect patience and understanding to be necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in the entire area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is constantly heard, and the sound and light show seems to be taken out of a storybook.
The sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains join to form this plateau, then split again to form the 360-kilometer chain of Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, called the Sentinel Range, are the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 4,892 m (15,980 ft).
In isolated places, with no cell phone service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone in general can't take the place of a cell phone because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is frequently used in maritime transport, including by pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions requiring remote data and voice transmission.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year off is to combine travel with study.
It is especially popular among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before going to university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a year of distance learning abroad can even increase your chances of getting into higher education in your home country.
There is normally a tuition fee which is paid when enrolled in these educational programmes.
Finland is a great place for canoeing.The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the offshore archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is 1 to 40).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for several whole days, returning on the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go by land for excursions on board a ship, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009)
Some cruise brochures show Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means near the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than the personal fears and dislikes of other things that manifest in a lot of people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help overcome fears that are based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for quick deliveries, and often delivery time is essential for documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies owned their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as carry-on baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a heap of money for that privilege (or, better yet, to get your company to do it for you).
But it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare in business class and up to eleven times more in first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking discounts for business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, where they charge fares according to the requirements.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from an inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, its second port after Istanbul and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, located around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass facade buildings and modern shopping malls, feature traditional 18th-century red-tiled roofs, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views over the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble carvings of doves over some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which has become beyond the country's borders following an enthusiastic review of its splendors by Lord Byron.
The Scottburb 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of the Holy Virgin of Fatima, a place known worldwide for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived being interned there, and many more who had family members who were killed or forced to work to death there, both Jews and others.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not vandalize the site by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and virtually all know Spanish.
However, most panels are only in Catalan, as it is established by law as the first official language.
Spanish is, however, widely used in public transportation, among other services.
Periodic announcements at the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, unpolitical and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that doesn't match reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is bien élevé (well raised).
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and scrub and has a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It hosts a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, moose, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide shelter for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear pants that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the front door, but those clothes aren't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any available seasonings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, and the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even inside a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or an adjective being used in a substantivized form.
The pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you should be more careful with are c and g, because their pronunciation varies with the vowel after them.
Also, be careful to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means cart.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Obviously, those who know a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may prematurely conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally outdated in our day and remain open as museums or educational venues.
Because in their heyday light pollution was not as big a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, being more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas that have favorable weather conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy of the Imperial Court.
The plants look no better anywhere than in their natural habitat, so do not be tempted to pick even just one of them.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting specimens will also lead to your expulsion, no question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
But being in the upper tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll be facing both heat (always) and strong sun (when it's clear, less often).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, where tradition holds that the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were buried with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.
Inland waterways can be a good theme for organizing a holiday.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to sites on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular walking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by unbelievers in Christendom and by non-Christians around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on the Saturday evening of Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally landed on the islands came here either swimming, flying or floating.
Because of its distance from the mainland, mammals have been unable to make the journey, with the result that the giant tortoise is the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you'll experience polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky will be more or less dark at that time.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not often a problem, you'll be able to enjoy the stars as well.
Japanese work culture has a stronger hierarchical and more formal character than that to which Westerners are accustomed.
Costumes are standard business attire, and coworkers address one another by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is a key element, with an emphasis on group effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often need to get approval from their superiors for all decisions they make and are expected to follow their instructions without question.
