In an emergency call, the professor confessed to shooting his girlfriend.
During a call to the emergency line in a trembling voice, Professor Shannon Lamb confessed to the police that he shot his girlfriend and they were required to come to their home.
Lamb determined that his "sweet dog" was alive at home and probably upset, and that contacts to the dead woman's family could be found on her phone.
Inside, police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note on white office paper that read, "I'm so sorry and wish I could return it, I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me", according to officials, a letter signed by Lamb.
There was no suspicion that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, would drive 300 miles to the campus where police believe he shot his favorite professor Ethan Schmidt at the door of his office.
Delta State University Chief of Police Lynn Buford said that university staff heard gunfire at 10:18 a.m.
Lamb made a fateful call to the emergency line shortly after.
Eventually, another death came; Lamb took his own life when the police came for him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to determine Lamb's motivation.
The details released by state investigators and students and staff who knew him, together created the image of a talented but probably problematic teacher.
The students confirmed that they were looking forward to his lesson.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, confirmed that he had no criminal record or violent past.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in his thanksgiving to the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Faculty of Social Sciences and History along with 17 other faculty members, and many students attended classes at both at the same time.
There were also inclinations to problems.
The student who praised Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed agitated and shaken, "as if something were wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for medical leave when he said he had a problem.
And this year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to the university's recruitment process meant that the doctorate Lamb worked hard on wouldn't guarantee him an automatic term to become an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Mrs. Lamb was apparently troubled".
Lamb won't answer those questions anymore.
After he left campus, police caught his trail as he crossed the Arkansas state line back to Mississippi.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a single gunshot wound in the backyard of a house about a mile from his parents in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, confirmed Washington State coroner Methel Johnson.
He left the car on the street.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, although Johnson said he probably knew the people who lived here.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at a university that has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and curriculum.
He got his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamba's longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and funny man.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She was with her friends in high school, and he was the great older boy who taught her how to play the guitar for years.
He was pretty heartbroken back then.
The hearts of all girls vanished as soon as he appeared", says Hairston, now in her 40s and living in the Jackson suburbs.
Lamb and Prentiss were supposed to be dating for a while.
During the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was never a record of the wedding.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house that sits on the banks of the Gautier River.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they broke up 15 years ago, but they remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19.
"She was completely devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She was best friends with her mother.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he knew Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were performing at the summer festival three years ago.
Later, they played random gigs together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a lighted bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, sweating Lamb playing guitar and harmonica for an uncountable crowd.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"It was just a happy couple", he said.
We were teasing and recording each other's jokes.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, a murdered professor, led a seminary in his freshman year and specialized in early American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of the Boys' Student Club and the student government.
At Delta State's Cleveland campus on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight vigil.
Schmidt's wife Liz, and brother Jeff Schnidt also attended the vigil, during which the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
School started again on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge says.
The crisis is over.
This is healing day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans, also contributed to this reporting.
This story has been edited to reflect the fact that police now claim Lamb made an emergency phone call after killing Schmidt, and that although Lamb called Prentiss his wife, there is no evidence that they were actually framed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer seasonal workers
Toys R Us claims they won't hire as many seasonal workers as last year, but children's toy and product manufacturers say it will give current employees and seasonal workers the chance to work longer hours.
The company also said it plans to hire about 40,000 employees to work in stores and distribution centers across the country, down from 45,000 last season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company says it's starting recruiting this month, and it's gonna be recruiting staff from October through December.
While the holidays themselves are months away, the shopping holiday season is approaching and companies are preparing to temporarily hire employees to assist in sales and sales, to ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox joking about his "rando" with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royal family to arrive, when I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I thought Princess Diana was sitting there", he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts and I realize I'm in the reach of something that could be called a fake date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary about Back to the Future featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The premiere of Back to the Future was 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "It's truly, for me, arguably the best travel documentary ever made".
Back in Time will be available on VOD, DVD and select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's accelerated military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict and more weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions.
The UN Chief has again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to meet with foreign ministers of the five permanent councils - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and regional powers "have made this situation intractable".
The Ban called on the five permanent members to show the solidarity and unity they have shown in reaching the Iran nuclear deal in resolving the crisis in Syria.
8 election numbers that show that Donald Trump in the real light
Some tried to label him a man who changed his mind often.
The others waved their hands like a joke.
And some are preparing for implosion.
But no matter how many Republicans try to pull Donald Trump off the top of the election, they're not doing it (so far).
10 of the last 11 national polls show that Donald Trump is a double-digit leader, and some people are starting to seriously wonder what that means for the prospects of this real estate mogul.
Of course, it's only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this says Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership paved the way for Herman Cain's rise, and in the end, none of them won a single position in the nomination process.
There are many reasons why he might run in the general election.
But outside groups like Super PAC Jeb Bush and the economic conservative Club for Growth realize Trump's will to hold on and start putting their dollars on hold to try to topple him.
Here are some recent voting numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a transitory phase:
Trump's favor rating has been reversed by 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a vote at Monmouth University showed that only two Republicans out of 10 had a positive view of this real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a favorable view of Donald Trump.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion of him.
And these numbers are still in their early stages.
Quinnipiac University's poll last week found that 60 percent of Republicans had a positive opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "excited" or "satisfied" with Trump as a candidate.
Only two out of 10 said they would be "angry" at his candidacy.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent of people said they would be "excited" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next up in excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "disappointed" if Jeb Bush's business favorite became a candidate.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his outrage and outrage, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide are inclined to believe that the real estate tycoon has the right temperament for the presidency, according to a Monday vote by ABC News/Washington Post.
The same number holds true for the Iowa State Senate Club, which is the first in the nation where 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet, 44 percent think they don't have the personality to serve effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say their temperament doesn't belong in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their student hats, Republican voters think Trump is the real candidate.
When asked who was most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump would be the best choice, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's a change from late July, when four out of 10 put their money on fucking Bush.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters have not had the brightest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the nominee against 28 percent for Mitt Romney's eventual nomination.
Yet it turns out that a certain number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as credible.
Even though Republicans have gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some scholars emphasize that the divided field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is widely spread among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey from Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical direct confrontation between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marc Rubi by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich, Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's in a dead race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
Ben Carson would lead the dealer by 19 wide in a hypothetical one-on-one match.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've already made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump-supporting voters say they won't change their minds.
Obviously, a lot of things can change, and no one can really say that they would never change their mind.
46 percent say they keep their back door open for a change between candidates.
Yet Trump's current strongest opponent is his outsider fellow neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who consider their opinion final would be twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans reportedly agree with Trump on immigration.
Even since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "violents" in his campaign speech, immigration remains the main and central topic of conversation for 2016.
Some fear Trump's outrage will alienate key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and damage rebranding efforts.
But according to a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
It seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the spotlight, so will Donald Trump.
The frustration with the government is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson today are receiving about half the support of Republican voters, especially given their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in the new Monday ABC/Post poll say they prefer a political outsider to someone with government experience.
And they're also very angry at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa a few weeks ago revealed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "fierce angry".
The House has supported a larger share of the state's coal tariffs.
The Czech Republic will get more than 400 million.
The House of Representatives, at first reading, supported the government's amendment to the upper law, which regulates the amount of the revenue from surface coal mining fees from mining companies.
Minister Jan Mladek (ČSSD) promised the deputies that this would give them extra money for both the state treasury and the municipal budgets.
The proposal was criticized by opposition members who feared that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they have done before, as they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget. The House in its first reading supported the government's new upper law, which among other things means that the state should receive a larger share of the revenue from surface coal mining fees from mining companies.
The share of the state will increase to 67%, while the share of municipalities will decrease from 75% to 33%.
The proposal also changes the way in which the remuneration for the minerals that firms extract is calculated.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring in a further KK 427 million to the State Treasury compared to 2013.
The government believes that the budget revenue of municipalities should be neutral because the fee is higher.
Last year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
The coal mining industry has earned about 200 million crowns for municipalities and 66 million crowns for the state.
The new plan also calls for an increase in the payment of the permitted mining fees to 1000 kronor per hectare per year.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mladek (ČSSD) told the deputies that municipalities would get from 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as a sum of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rate for each mineral species.
The government believes that the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government decree may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral that is state property.
The fees are only paid to municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be applied to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
A portion of the money collected by the State on the mining charges will be tied up on purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to secure a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticised by opposition MPs who argued in particular that it would harm the mining-affected communities and the countryside.
For example, Michal Kucher (TOP 09 and the Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they did before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to get the finance minister to improve his budget", said David Kádner (Usvit), elected in Ustek region.
The UN Security Council has warned of the rise in unemployment in Mostecka.
Kadner and Aulika unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the novel, and Kucher wanted the law back in the government for further development.
The reasoning states that the mining companies claim that the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices because prices are more than 90% long-term.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should not feel the increase in prices.
'On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees,' the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees in terms of employment is acceptable.
According to the rapporteur for the Milan Urbana report (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal limits before the law is passed.
If coal is extracted beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladáček that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not be taken until 2020.
The limits on ČSA mining should be broken down already for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
The Chechen will lead the Chechen army as the first, deploying weather-impairing troops.
All four Czech tennis players will appear at the Thursday draw of the Davis Cup House in India on the board, and this time, each of them will most likely be in the game.
Captain Jaroslav Navrtil plans to distribute the load to the entire quartet due to the difficult conditions.
Delhi is hot and humid, so tough matches are expected, which can last up to five hundred.
We have to take that into account.
I'd like to spread it by the weather.
And according to what it looks like, he said he returned to the Czech team training today at the Raja Kumar Khanna Centre.
With the number one team and world number 40, Jerry Vessel is counting on Friday and Sunday's doubleheader.
In the position of two, Lucas Rosol and Radek Stepanek are probably the ones who are going to be the first.
I'd like almost everyone involved.
I'm slowly thinking about it, but I'm not gonna say it yet, the captain said.
Another guarantee in the Czech set-up should be the participation of Stepanák in Saturday's quarter-final.
It's just a question of who's gonna stand by an experienced fat guy who's got an 18-4 quarterback in Davis Cup.
It's probably not going to be fun.
There's still a chance with Rosole or Adam Pavlos.
"I really don't know who and what it's going to look like", he said.
It's based on the development of the two games.
The variant could be Pavlasek, with Vesel surprised in the first round by a win over the Australians.
"It's decent in the trunk", said the return.
I did it against Australia, and if I play, I'd like to do the same performance I did there from the second set.
"I'm happy for the experience and I'd like to make a point", said Pavlasek.
The home side will be joined by Yuki Bhambri (125) in the ATP rankings, who won last week's challenger in Shanghai, where he beat the third and fourth place players.
The second is Somdev Devvarman (164).
They're both challenger players, and we've both been on the ATP Tour, but we've seen a lot of times that the Davis Cup ladder doesn't make the decision.
"It decides the momentary shape, the weather", he said back.
Friday's opening doubleheader starts at 6:30 PM ET and may be delayed due to weather.
It's supposed to be raining and the curtain isn't under the roof.
However, it may be possible to play with artificial lighting.
They've already lit it up, and it's worth about two thousand lux, which is enough.
"It should be played under the lights", he said back.
Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut on Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQ is highly anticipated.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will make his debut in Prime Minister's Questions later, and for the first time, will be working with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, while his performance is likely to be closely monitored by the media and MPs.
In a weekly statement, he called for "less theater and more facts".
He also said he could skip a few sessions he'd leave to his colleagues.
This meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corby's leadership following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his Tuesday address to TUC's annual congress.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silently during the national anthem at the service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was met with criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and has been the focus of several newspaper headline stories.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Mr. Corbyn's spokesman said he would "stand in honorable silence" and acknowledge "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told BBC Two's Newsnight that he would recommend that the Labour leader sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign affairs, and only less than a sixth of parliamentary parties originally supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences in work are also "getting worse" after Mr Corbyn's appointment over his position in the European Union and the government's benefit limit.
Mr Corbyl stated at the TUC conference that the Labour Party had submitted amended proposals to remove the whole idea of the benefit limit.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the secretary of shadow jobs and pensions, said that the party "very clearly" opposed government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade since his election as leader of the Conservatives.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, claims he has ideas "out of the crowd" for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
MP Islington North says PMQs are too confrontational and that they will refrain from both "post-response" and "busted trade", and instead promise to focus on important issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges young people face.
Mr Corbyn claims that Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary, will represent him at PMQ if she doesn't attend, like when Mr Cameron travels abroad.
He also gave up the idea of letting his fellow members speak for him from time to time because he was told he was still discussing the matter with House Speaker John Bercow.
When Mr Cameron became leader in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the "Punch and Judy" style of politics that was often associated with PMQ, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQ has been seen as a key barometer of leaders' judgment, their leadership of the House and their stance among other MPs, although critics have argued that they have become a caricature and require far-reaching reforms.
"Fotography in Joburg": Young homeless people trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be homeless.
But a group of former street children found a way to learn and make a living.
"I Was Photographed in Joburg" is a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless youth how to photograph their neighborhood and make money.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of this project.

The pound rises as wages in the UK accelerate
The Libra leaped the following dates and showed a recovery in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was driven up by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and June, the profits of GB including bonuses increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
It was the fastest since 2009, and it looked like estimates were approaching when rates would rise.
Sterling rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was an exceptional stock on the market and jumped 20% after receiving a close bid from its rival AB InBev.
The deal would combine the two biggest breweries in the world, and the rapprochement of brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% after encouraging reports from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales results are above all expectations and show that sales in China, a key market for Burberry, have begun to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a joint venture as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in the Mondi Packaging and Paper Group were the biggest losses on the index, falling 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on the company to "sold".
JD Sports up 3.1% after sports company reported a 83% jump in pre-tax profits of £46.6m
JD Sports' boss says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, executive chairman of JD Sports, says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that the purchasing power would carry the higher wage costs in his company, he says.
The costs could impact plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
The Prague apartment building's opponents are chanting marshmallows.
The controversial building has been shut down.
Investor Praga Progetti e Investimenti considers the annulment of the decision unlawful and will appeal against it.
A hundred people protested the building, which is to be built near Anezhskaya Monastery in the center of Prague, and a petition was also raised.
The court found in the decision that there had been a breach of the building code because all the details of the territorial decision were not complied with.
'The territorial decision in question does not contain certain elements, such as the type of land, the distance from adjacent buildings, the shape of the building sufficiently clearly and clearly described, the definition of the territory affected by the construction', it states.
The court also considers that certain documents for the decision were issued to the original documents, which have been amended.
This is the case, for example, of the opinion of the environmental authorities.
Part of the building is to be built on the National Gallery grounds, but the investor has no valid consent.
However, it is clear from the documents that the landlord only confirmed his agreement to the project documentation for the territorial management, not his agreement to place the building on his land, writes the building clerk.
According to Francesco Augusto Razetta of the investment firm, the building codes department did not take into account the decision of the local development ministry, the supervisory authority, that the deadline for the opening of the review had already expired.
This is a scandalous procedure anyway.
"We have been preparing this project for 17 years, we comply with all the laws of the Czech Republic and respect all the authorities and institutions concerned", Razetto said in a press release.
The project, which people nickname the marshmallow because of the supposedly designed façade color, is stirring up intense emotion in Prague.
Hundreds of people have gathered in the city centre in the past to protest the construction.
The association and residents of nearby houses are disturbed that some permits were issued many years ago for a house that was to look different.
They also criticize the unsuitability of the building for the historic centre of Prague and the immediate vicinity of Anezhskaya Monastery.
The house was designed by architect Zdeněk Fránek, the design has changed several times.
The original 2008 design, which included a glass facade, was rejected by the Ministry of Culture on the basis of the opinion of the National Monuments Institute (NTU) and the Prague Monuments Authority revoked its permit in 2010.
The new project of Prague Progetti e Investimenti with facial windows but NPU and the municipal monuments approved and a building permit was issued on this basis.
The author of the proposal rejects the criticism of the opponents, saying he never counted on the pink facade that gave the project the nickname of pinkish-white sugarcane.
Czech politician took the migrants.
The Hungarians put him in jail with them.
Berg went to Hungary to deliver humanitarian aid to the refugees.
On the way, he and his crew took three Syrian refugees into their car, who were reportedly about half a mile away.
He said it was not a crime in Hungary at the time.
We knew law enforcement wouldn't take such action.
But when the police stopped us, to our surprise, they arrested us and transferred us to the interrogation detention center in Szeged, he described the letter.
The politician ended up spending nine hours in his cell.
The police were behaving correctly, but communication was limited because they did not speak English well.
But he said the prison was a sad place.
For example, in our cell, about three times four meters in size, there were 15 Syrian refugees.
Among them was a two-year-old boy or a four-year-old girl.
These people had been locked up there the other day, and because of the language barrier, none of them knew what was going to happen to them, Berg said.
What can't he take away?
Ask the president of the executive chamber.
On Friday, September 18, the President of the Czech Republic's Executive Chamber, Msgr. Pavla Fučiková, will answer questions from readers from 9.30 a.m.

Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's aggression in South and Western Australia.
Metcash is launching a campaign in the countryside to fight Aldi's invasion
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first of more than 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are joining brands such as Simmo's, a Dunsborough-based ice cream maker, offering flavours in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets to Australian Football League customers locally.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29th, when the food, alcohol and hardware vendor celebrates its annual investor strategic day.
There's a lot at stake because South and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash IGA's business moves and generate higher turnover than the Metcash IGA network in the Eastern states.
Customers in South and Western Australia are notoriously provincial, and IGA's stores enjoy a much stronger market share than those in NSW, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the SA and 24 percent in WA, compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be in the top 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores that took in revenue from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
This week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated in his report that IGA retail could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Australia and 30 in the West over the next year, generating sales of USD 500 million and USD 600 million in individual markets.
The loss of food sales and volumes in the fixed price base of Metcash could cost him around US$13 million in pre-tax revenues, Mr Kierath confirmed.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern states, especially to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers were the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its market share will decline from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the chief executive of the Magellan Fund, said that business lunches in Melbourne could "highly likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Douglass's comment.
But it's known that a Metcash board member contacted Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 and earnings from the Metcash food business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational evolution of the speculation shift as sales and revenues are under pressure.
However, wholesalers have taken a counterattack, investing over $150 million a year to match the Coles and Woolworths' desk prices on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA retailers re-equip their stores by adding fast-growing food and news from privateers.
Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice claims that the price-balancing and supply-side schemes are falling and hopes that the wholesaler will return to a core profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more fame than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a casualty of a recent rumor surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior, says Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo often called the "Special Ks", has attracted unwelcome attention due to an affair with the infamous Kyrgios and Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, in a passionate qualifying match in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, Harrison then declared, "Wawrinka had to draw one for Kyrgios and I had to draw one for him too".
While he was last seen smashing a rocket after a stroke knocked out Richard Gasquet's possible US Open victory, Kokkinakis was a staunch defender of Healy.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, where he is competing with Sam Groth for a place in the second double after Bernard Romic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I've been thinking quite intensely about how I think Thanasi was a little involved in the whole fight", Healy says.
He destroyed the rocket when he lost to the US cricket, but he's not the first player to get angry on his rocket because of frustration.
But he really did manage very well, because he was exposed to very provocative circumstances in the US because of Harrison and so on, so in my opinion he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a fantastic team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little rough.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works very hard and he fits the team very well and so on, he's never had a problem with other players, he's very well respected in the dressing room, he's training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very stable and mature young boy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to overlook Kyrgios for an important match starting on Friday, stating that the "mutual decision" is the right solution for all but encouraging the Canberra native to return to the team as a long-term fixture.
"First of all, we want our team to be completely focused on the game and not all the controversy that has been going on around [Kyrgios]", says Healy.
And I think Nick has risen very quickly, as Federer, Murray and other people point out, growing up in the public eye very quickly, he's also made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and some time outside the box, when he can think about it, in my opinion, is the best solution for the team and for him.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes borders and detain migrants
Following the threat, Hungary closed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained those who tried to cross it illegally to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos erupted at the border, while hundreds of migrants had gathered in the no man's land, and Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
Those who have been stuck for an unknown time on the land between two states stand those who are fleeing violence in their home countries, building tents and settling down.
But there are frustrations.
When helicopters fly over them, migrants shout "Open the borders!" together and curse the Hungarian police.
Some refuse food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister says it was "unacceptable" for refugees to be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not just indirect harm.
In the coming days, discussions will be necessary with Brussels and other countries", says Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-state bloc failed to come up with a unified immigration policy at its ongoing meetings in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in surprise Italy and Greece, and spoke of the hope of reaching an eventual agreement next month or the end of the year that would allow the EU nations to take in more than 120,000 more refugees, including Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria have called a special EU summit next week to discuss the continental refugee crisis.
Hungary, however, has not turned its hopes to Brussels or its neighbours.
The threat situation in the two southern regions has given the authorities greater power to deal with the crisis and allowed them to close roads and speed up the judicial process of asylum negotiations.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stop refugees trying to cross their country as the fence on the Serbian border is now completed.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were on the list of those who helped to wire the straitjacket between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major weakness and entry point for refugees into the European Union, many of whom have fled Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, insisted that most of them are economic migrants, seeking a better life, not war refugees seeking protection, a view that is clearly different from other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary now criminalize violations of a 4-meter fence that the government had set up on the southern border with Serbia, and also provide for longer prison terms for those who illegally transfer refugees.
"Thanks to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We're pretty clear about this: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Technically, the parliament still has to approve the deployment of the army, which was expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been watching a heavily armed army with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic defense adviser, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 had already been caught on state soil.
They broke through the fence and are now in police custody charged with offences under the new laws.
The authorities quickly had the fence repaired.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two of seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after using a tow truck covered in barbed wire.
Chaos erupted at the main border crossing near Roszke, as the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal processing container and people were pressured.
About 20 of them went in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of refugees blocked the main highway between Serbia and Hungary by refusing food and water until they were allowed to cross the border into Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national vote
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a two-digit lead in the Democratic nomination race nationwide, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton is now supported by 47 percent of Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who is about to announce whether he wants to run for president, is getting the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the main contests begin, the most democratic voters say it's too early to say that there are clear decisions about which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton sponsors are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News poll, Clinton has lost ground to several demographic groups, while Sanders has gained several.
Clinton is keeping a big lead among women and is tempering, but her leadership is tightening.
Her men's support has dropped sharply, and Sanders is losing by only five points.
Clinton's advantage over Democratic voters under 50 has vanished and they're now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton still has a great lead thanks to older voters.
Clinton had a double-digit lead over Sanders among the Liberals last month, but now Sanders is losing by just five points in that group.
About half of all Democratic primary voters in every state say they would be thrilled to support Clinton if she became the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support her.
It's probably no surprise that current Clinton supporters are particularly fond of her.
Views are mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton -- only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their favorite, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as a candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), follows that it's time for her to be a woman president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the use of the 'non-compliance' principle.
While the vice president is considering a potential presidential bid, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to run for office - a third think he shouldn't run.
When primary Democratic voters were asked who they would choose as the second choice for the party's nomination, the most common choice was Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, she listed more than half of Biden as their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's leadership will expand from 20 points when Biden runs to 30 points without his candidacy.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far second on this scale, but the percentage of people who see him as the most likely candidate is increasing.
However, when the question of the greater importance of the candidate comes up, democratic voters prefer to solve problems over greater chances of election.
As last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is running as an unacceptable candidate for these primary electors.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have good results in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and think they have strong leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three in honesty, while Clinton is a strong leader.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't.
Primary Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideological views.
As far as all these standards go, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue about Hillary Clinton's decision to use her personal email and server as secretary of state, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their overall view of it at all.
But among the American public, it's a completely different story.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that this email controversy has no effect on their overall view of Clinton, while 36 percent say their view of Clinton has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, where more than six out of 10 say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is perceived as honest and trustworthy among her party's voters, this issue is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think she's honest or trustworthy.
And 55 percent of registered voters across the country don't see Trump as honest and trustworthy either.
But Clinton and Trump have good leadership marks.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best in honesty.
Sanders sees more people as honest than dishonest, but like Carson, a lot of voters didn't take him seriously.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson finished behind Donald Trump in the national election
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
Two candidates account for half of the voters in the most recent poll, and the rest are left to seek support.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump with an overwhelming majority, rising from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before the Fox News debate last month to 27% on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6 to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well across demographic groups, and it's knocking Trump out of the ranks of college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is back, along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, at a full eight-point from 10% support down to the current 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are all in third place together with 6 percent.
The margin of error in the 376 Republican voter sample in the most recent poll is plus minus 6%, and it was conducted in September.
The most recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson improved and gained 19% of the Republican vote against Trump's 32%.
A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump to be significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's upward trend, Trump decided to blindly shoot a retired neurosurgeon, and Carson even apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump declared last Saturday during his Iowa campaign.
Five fraternity members charged with the death of a first-year student at Baruch College
Almost two years after a student died during a fraternity overload ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during the opening ceremony in September 2013 and took him to the hospital late, contributing to his death, police said.
Police report that he had his eyes tied, had a bag full of sand weighing 30 pounds on him, and was repeatedly harassed as he tried to reach his target through a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache and then passed out.
Pi Delta Psi fraternity members did not call 911 immediately after Deng fainted, and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they took time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, and ask him for advice, police chief Chris Vagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and basically put the well-being of the fraternity before the life of Michael Deng", Chief Wagner said.
He was unable to revive and died the next morning.
According to the medical examiner's report, Deng was repeatedly struck by a blunt object in the head, torso and thigh.
"Too many families have been devastated by overloading in fraternities, and at least one student has died each year from overloading since 1970", states Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members have responsibility, and this step is important for the authorities.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended a third-degree murder charge against the first five members.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Menga, will also be charged with assault with intent to override and criminal collusion.
"We want to not only detain those involved, but if there is an organization that has approved it, whether officially or unofficially, we will hold them accountable as well", Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity and the National Brotherhood terminated its relationship with local chapters.
This happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Interest rates will rise and bull markets will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will slip into recession.
We know all this.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna take.
For the economy, specifically, the history of the small business offers timing.
The recession came 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising rates is often, though not always, decisive in how the economy and financial assets will react.
That's why US central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not be focused on when the rate hike starts, but rather on the trajectory of how long the normalisation will take.
There's actually more variables in the game.
However, in the end, market members can ensure that all the noise caused by the increase in speed can be exaggerated.
"The first Fed increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the 'cheap money' era", said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to create a seismic shock that many might fear.
That means there's going to be adverse effects.
Here's a look at how certain areas of the economy will react, based on historical trends:
Given the market's record over the last month or so, the expected increase in prices may make the air a little volatile.
But once the increase occurs, the effect will not be so dramatic.
"There appears to be a trend for stopping stocks again after 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed increases.
More specifically, the market over the last 35 years or so has often been the most - about 14 percent - aimed at rising relatively flat rates in 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent), and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Dolla, chief stock strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published on Barron.
Deutsche said the impact on shares tends to become more significant later in the rate hike cycle and the return is starting to decline.
Recession is a fact of life, but interest rate hikes often help it.
The Fed is currently facing some conditions that have not yet existed that could accelerate recessions.
Most remarkably, the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point in history in Fed rate hikes.
According to Deutsche Bank, during the 118 rate increases since 1950, GDP has only doubled in nominal terms in the intervening years to below 4.5%.
Although it was 3.6% in the second quarter of 2015, few expected it to remain at just 1.5% in the third quarter, reports the Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates in this complex economic environment could be risky and the question 'is this time different' could arise, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been prepared for Fed growth all year and all eyes are on the Federal Free Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve the increase at this meeting, future trading indicates only a 25% likelihood.
"In our study from 1950, all the upward cycles so far were in a super-cycle of leverage increase with GDP covering the peak of the recession very quickly after the recovery began", the report says.
On the contrary, this was clearly a slow recovery from the worst recession in the sampling period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, now we're 74 months and we're still going.
The fixed yield was also volatile as the market expects to see interest rates rise and the pattern is somewhat similar to that experienced by stocks.
The main difference is that the impact is more pronounced on bonds than stocks when the Fed changes policy direction.
For bonds, yields appear to change direction immediately after the first increase/decrease cycle.
At the end of the cycle of bond yield increases, they fall immediately", Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rate hike will bring returns between long- and short-dated bonds closer together, which will compensate for the curve.
High-yield debt often works better in this climate, although "we're still careful about tightening yields", said Kathy Jones, a firm fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in her analysis.
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusting to the expectations of Fed policy.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adapted to the prospects of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yield curve is wider, the credit spread has expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tights policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US will win interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will do worse because the rising dollar will make their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt will also be higher.
"History shows that the 'quality' of stocks tends to overtake within three months of the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outperformed weak-balance sheet firms in any interest rate increase in 1994, 1999, 2004 on average by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital, as well as stocks with low volatility, also outperformed their lower quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with high volatile interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
In addition to pure action, consumers are also benefiting from the rising dollar.
Savers can see their gains through higher returns, but experts have differing opinions on how long it will take.
Radio 3 is a copy of the BBC Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticized the station for "deceiving"
It's been said that he's getting more and more indistinguishable from his commercial rival.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards and says that they're just cheating on the British.
Co-deputy Damien Collins attacked the Voice and said he wasn't the original idea either.
BBC Radio 3 is "changing" to Classic FM, the prime minister says, and is putting fresh air pressure on broadcasters to prove they are doing something commercial broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that public service stations appeared to be "dumbed up" and increasingly unrecognizable from their business rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be -- I hate to use the word 'cluttered' -- but it seems to be changing to Classic FM", he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, which began in December last year.
The BBC Music Awards, which began last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different -- these are two examples that really strike me, when you're actually just imitating what we already have on the market", said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC's chief executive denied the accusation, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of live music and public education.
What I learned about classical music on Radio 3 I wouldn't have learned on any other radio.
And their commitment to live with music and create music is actually at the top of their game.
"I also think that Radio 3's commitment to finding new music and putting new works into operation is also very important", he says.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 regulator Alan Davey argued that it is now necessary to work harder to engage audiences than ever before, because Britons are less educated about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only BBC production to come under fire for stepping on the feet of commercial competitors during the Culture, Media and Sport broadcast and to have been heard by the commission.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch producer Talp Media for an estimated £22 million.
See why this program is being discussed as unoriginal and not very different?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - which stars Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a manner typical of the BBC".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit out of its own nest" when it launches a fun series next.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more future The Voice series or spending license fee fees on other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales are growing at the slowest pace since August and it could be Black Friday's fault.
The first three months of 2015 saw a 7% increase in online sales
Last month saw the lowest growth since records began in 2000.
Internet sales were boosted three years ago by mobile shopping
Experts believe that November Black Friday could be a reason to curb spending
For more than a decade, virtual shopping has been on the rise, and it has made many of Britain's major streets ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are signs of a steady decline in online sales and new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure for August represented the lowest growth increase since the start of the 2000 measurement, with an increase of only 5% compared to the previous year.
Experts claim that there are signs of a steady pace of online sales and that new data show a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
"When you look at the growth rate over the years and go back to 2000, it's always been rationalized over time", says Andy Mulcahy, editor of IMRG's Sales Index, for the Guardian.
It explains that online sales were strengthened three years ago when customers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that people were able to shop online and that they were able to make purchases in different contexts, like on the couch.
But now it's stagnating a little, and that's why it seems to be ringing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was taken from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the drop in sales.
Experts believe that customers may be reluctant to shop before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times as many shoppers as the average turned to their computers to arrange their purchases, while linking several vendor websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which allows shoppers to re-negotiate, may keep customers from making further purchases
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only £1 out of every £5 was wasted online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of sales are made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of shopping in jewelry fashion stores.
Muslims buried the victims of the Mecca screw-up and the Bin Laden family were sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead were carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funeral in Mecca
Saudi Arabia is partly blaming the collapse of construction magnate Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury 29 victims of the screw-up at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, carrying their bodies across the street.
Dressed in a certain white, the mourners chose the path and paid homage to the victims as the first of the fallen made his final journey to the cemetery at Al-Moaiss.
A sad message passed through the holy place, where just days earlier a construction screw broke through the ceiling of the mosque and plunged the believers.
The bodies were released for burial and the Saudi king sanctioned the bin Laden family construction group over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 people killed in the crane crash at the Grand Central Mosque in Mecca were carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Qasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Machester, who was on his first voyage when the screw crashed.
Mr. Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj pilgrimage began.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will be held and thousands of people continue to descend into the city.
King Salman today announced that Binadin Group should not have left the shoulder of the crane up when it was not in operation.
The Arab version of the decree, carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that Binladin Group is partly to blame for the fall.
The UK record label did not disclose this detail, but it did say that the company's executives were banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall into the grounds of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims are converging before the Hajj later this month.
Binladin Group has not made any declarations of crane collapse and its representatives have not been made available for comment.
The Royal Decrees also accused the group of failing to implement the latest security measures and of not coordinating with meteorological officials.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque in Mecca, which is part of a massive construction effort led by Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades and run major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader, Usama bin Laden, was the son of a heretic whose family renounced him in the 1990s.
The accident happened amidst strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom on a pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Officials have determined that one million riyals (£174,000) will be given to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount for the permanently wounded.
The other wounded will receive half of that amount.
B&Q's boss says East European merchants working for cheap are already trending
Britons are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of trained merchants from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is 200 Screwfix stores open targeting merchants.
At the same time, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
Edited by Rupert Steiner, chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put away hammers and brushes and hand them over to employed trained East European craftsmen to work at home.
If you're good with a hammer or a paintbrush, you seem to be in the minority today.
Because the British are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do the boxwork at home, according to the head of the company at Screwfix B&Q.
Veronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain for domestic use, argues that the large increase in the number of educated merchants from Eastern Europe offering services at the lowest possible prices is no longer a trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores targeting retailers, and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Ms. Laura says she wants to hire more women at B&Q because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store make the better half.
Today, most workers are male.
She said there was a need to address the growing demographic trends that show more female households doing more home improvement than in the past.
"Our stores still are mostly men", says Mrs. Laura.
We need to get closer to balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, making 80% of the purchasing decisions.
Women play a big role in decision-making.
Ms Laura, one of only five women at the helm of a UK-based FTSE100 leader, has also restructured her senior team to reflect the equality between female and male CEOs.
Kingfisher stands alone in having half the female workforce, including executive and chief financial officer.
"It was a conscious decision", says Laura, "diversity is an important issue here.
So it wasn't hard to find a good woman to marry.
Kingfisher announced a drop in both profits in mid-year and sales after the group took over the cost of closing stores.
The trend for Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is to open 200 new stores.
The December pension payment of 600 crowns is at stake.
"It is justice of equal stomachs, it has nothing to do with human justice", said TOP 09 Vice President Miroslav Kalousek, who stressed the principle of merit.
The chairman of the ODS MPs, Zbyněk Stanjura, noted that a one-off contribution sounds good, but in the long run it would be better if it were in standard valuation, as it would be reflected in the years ahead.
"We have room to find a mechanism to do this", Stanjura said.
He supported the original proposal by Minister Michaela Marksova (ČSSD) to value the next year beyond the law.
Marks defended the grant by arguing that it would improve the social situation of pensioners, which she did not believe was pink.
A higher valuation next year would mean a budget impact of 5.5 billion crowns, and ministers are debating every 100 million.
Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka (ČSSD) reminded the right that the pace of the recovery has slowed in the past.
The Commission has also taken note of the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal to reduce the amount of pension benefits in the form of a pension.
This right to pay in December will be significantly complicated and perhaps impossible, he said.
The chairman of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Deputies, Roman Sklenák, therefore proposed to reduce the deadline for the discussion of the standard in the committee to 10 or 20 days, which the right-wing blocked.
But the committee will have a month instead of the usual two.
The bonus should be worth a total of 1.73 billion crowns.
The money is to come mainly from the budget of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
Retirement income is expected to increase by about 100 crowns on average next year.
The pension should be paid by the people who are entitled to a pension or part of it in December.
It could also be obtained by those who lost their pension entitlement before it was paid in December.
However, they would have to apply for the allowance in writing, at the latest by the end of next year.
Pension rates in the Czech Republic are regularly updated in January, with prices rising and real wages rising by one third.
This year, the pension corresponds to 41.5% of gross wages, next year it should be 40.5%.
According to the State's final accounts, the State spent CRO 314.7 billion on old-age pensions last year, which was about five billion more per year.
The expenditure on old-age pensions accounted for 26 percent of all budgetary expenditure and 46 percent of all statutory expenditure.
The average full old-age pension increased last year by 104 to 10 714 crowns, according to the figures in the final State Accounts.
The Czech Social Security Administration provided for the payment of 2.4 million full old-age pensions and about 17,000 proportional pensions.
Jakunin has abandoned his political plans and is going to pursue science.
The billionaire was almost certainly in the Senate, according to Russian media.
He was to represent the Kaliningrad region of western Russia in the Federation Council, whose governor Nikolai Cukanov, as a candidate of the ruling United Russia Party, had successfully defended his position in Sunday's elections.
Under Russian law, senators do not elect citizens, but are chosen by the governor from among three candidates whose names he will announce before the gubernatorial election.
After the election, the senator will choose from three candidates.
The complication for Jakunin was the fact that he had not lived in the Kaliningrad region for 20 years as required by law.
The Kremlin has made an exception for Jakunin, except that he is an extraordinary and authorized ambassador, who is not subject to the legal requirement of long-term residence.
The Czech comedy Theory of the Tiger is over.
The final straw in the protagonist's plan is the voluntary death of his father-in-law, who is now exhausted of strength and patience.
Grandmother - Iva Janjurova decided on grandfather's life, old age and funeral.
Jan knows that he and his wife, Olga, are on a similar journey.
He remembers that he once had his own will and dreams, wants to live again with dignity and freedom.
He longs to regain control of his life - and as a solution he chooses to escape from what he has so far, he said of the Slavic story.
Bajgar wanted to capture a kind of relationship in which one partner doesn't feel completely free.
It was clear from the beginning that the lead role would be for Bartošek, who he had worked with on the series Invisible.
Yet, he was surprised by the actor, who appeared on camera after a long recovery break after a serious illness.
We made a deal three years ago.
I had him read the script, and he said he liked how sad he was.
And I was surprised to find out he's a sporting athlete.
Because before the next scene, he always asked where he was going to sit.
This time he rode a bike, climbed rocks, and even walked up a hill.
And all in record-breaking tropical storms, the director noted.
According to Bartoska, women take a tiger to turn it into a rabbit.
They feed him a little, but they close the door so he doesn't have to play tiger outside the rabbit shop.
And that's what we're trying to tell our movie about, the actor commented.
His wife, who may have a slightly negative effect on the audience, was played by Elisa Balzer.
She's not just a negative character.
She's also nice, smart, empathetic, and well-meaning.
But she's also a usurper and wants to bake her husband to death, Bajgar said.
The film also parallels the fate of Jan's married daughters Olinka and Alenka - Tanya Vilhelmová and Pavel Beretová - and sons-in-law Erik and Pepik - Jiří Havelka and Jakub Kohák.
The film is produced by Petr Erben of Logline Production, co-producers of Czech Television and Rozhlas and TV Slovakia.
Google has promised millions of dollars to help refugees in Europe.
Google, the American internet company, has pledged to provide up to $5.5 million to organizations helping thousands of refugees flocking to Europe.
She announced this on Tuesday at Google.org, the charitable arm of the Internet company.
Azerbaijan canceled part of Telik's visit for criticising human rights violations.
Czech MEP for the ANO party Pavel Telička has postponed his planned trip to Baku on Thursday because the Azerbaijani authorities have cancelled an official part of his visit today.
Baku said this was justified by last week's EP resolution, which criticized human rights violations in Azerbaijan and which Telicka co-authored.
The decision of the Azerbaijani party Telicka has deprived the party of the possibility of interviewing official partners and also of visiting political prisoners, which is subject to the consent of the authorities, its Brussels office explained in a press release.
The text sent by the Czech Republic clarified that the route, which had been planned several months in advance, was intended to be used by Telička to meet with parliamentary leadership and executive representatives as well as representatives of the democratic opposition, dissidents and political prisoners.
The EP resolution condemns the "unprecedented repression against civil society in Azerbaijan".
It called on European officials to consider sanctions against all politicians, officials and judges involved in political persecution.
The resolution was passed shortly after the recent verdict against Azerbaijani opposition journalist Chadidja Ismail, who campaigned for the exposing of corruption in government circles.
Russia is not excluding the possibility of building an air base in Syria.
Bogdanovsky, while visiting Novosibirsk, did not rule out the possibility of a future Russian air base in Syria.
We don't have any plans yet.
But nothing is ruled out, he said.
Russia already has a naval base in Syria in the port of Tartus, which until now has been used mostly as a service and logistics center.
But Russian media reports say that since the beginning of August, Russian arms and military supplies to Syria have increased.
According to Moscow, these are arms shipments resulting from the existing trade agreements.
The Pentagon claims that the Russians plan to establish an air base near Latakia, which for the time being remains the bastion of Syrian President Bashar Assad.
But Washington is not entirely clear about Russia's specific military intentions in Syria, American commentators agree.
US Secretary of State John Kerry spoke to Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday about the situation in Syria, their third phone call in ten days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to travel to Moscow next week to voice concerns over the Russian stockpile buildup near Israel.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest has called Moscow's support for Assad a losing bet.
He said that Russia's policy goals in Syria were rather unclear.
Moscow has made its satellite out of Syria, he says.
It may mean that President Vladimir Putin is pursuing a more long-term goal, but what, according to Ernest, is not entirely clear.
According to speculation in the Russian press today, the war in Syria is to be the main topic of Putin's speech at the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting in New York.
On the contrary, the Russian leader is not willing to talk about the situation in the Ukrainian Donbass.
According to a report by the New York Times today, the U.S. government does not rule out that President Barack Obama may meet with the Russian president during the UN meeting.
But I'm told that the views of the White House counselors are still divided.
Today, TASS, citing Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, said that Putin has not yet met with Obama on his New York visit.
Add sesame oil to your gallbladder diet, hemp helps boost immunity.
A good way to increase the supply of beneficial unsaturated fatty acids from these fruits is to use extra virgin oils.
When sprayed from the seeds in the cold, all the healthy substances remain in the oil.
Therefore, these oils are also suitable as part of healthy diets, such as gallstones.
Some extra virgin oils are suitable for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.
According to the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech Republic, these are the most common cause of death among Czechs for several years.
Gastroesophageal disorders are mainly women, and sesame oil helps.
If you are an Asian food lover, you must not miss sesame oil, which is part of the original recipes for exotic food.
Unlike most other oils, it can be used in the heat treatment of food and has a number of beneficial health effects.
It is often used in the gallbladder diet.
The essential fatty acids it contains are a good preventant of gallstones.
They are 90% of the causes of gallstones, and women have these problems three times more often than men.
In general, gallstones are particularly common among overweight people who do not exercise and consume a lot of animal fat.
Sesame oil can also be successfully used in a liver diet that is very similar to that of the gallbladder.
If people want to benefit from the health benefits of this oil, they should be careful about exotic food products.
Asian producers often use the more pronounced, overcooked seeds to sprinkle.
But the oil will lose all its active ingredients, explained Ladislav Hačecký, CEO of the Czech company Bohemia Olej z Kraslic in Sokolovsk, which produces bio-virgin oils pressed cold.
The company also produces sesame oil newly and uses only unripe white sesame seeds.
In an hour, our fox can weigh up to eight kilos of sesame.
The raw material shall be heated by mechanical spraying to a maximum of 40 degrees Celsius and therefore the product meets the criteria for extra virgin labelling.
At higher temperatures, there would be a loss of nutrients.
Sunflower oil is good for heart and blood vessel disease.
The Czech's favorite among oils is sunflower.
A study by Jarmila Hamerska, who led Masaryk University, found that 43% of respondents preferred it in a warm kitchen.
However, it is not actually suitable for frying, starting to burn at 180 °C.
It is best used, for example, for salads and is particularly useful in diets where it helps prevent cardiovascular disease.
It contains a high proportion of omega-6 fatty acids, which are the most potent cholesterol-lowering fatty acids.
For heart problems, you should be careful about the total amount of fat and calories you consume.
For example, a tablespoon of sunflower oil has 62 calories, and a tablespoon of peppermint oil has 99 calories.
As far as the energy value of food is concerned, it is important to remember that natural foods with nutrients are much more suitable than empty calories.
These are part of industrial products.
Therefore, it is advisable to reach for extra virgin oils.
The sunflower will last as long as sesame and hemp for nine months.
Storage in the refrigerator will extend the shelf life.
Old oil is known to people primarily by its bitter taste.
On the contrary, there is no coughing at the bottom.
It's a sign that the substance wasn't chemically refined.
Hemp oil contains the most healthy acids.
The seeds of technical hemp are among the so-called superfoods, and hemp oil is therefore often considered the healthiest of the vegetable oils.
This designation is due to the highest content of omega 3 and omega 6 unsaturated fatty acids.
These essential fatty acids cannot be produced by the body itself, and they must be absorbed by the human body through food.
Omega-3 fatty acids are particularly important.
A study by scientists published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that the daily intake of this substance is insufficient.
Men in France and Greece consume 0.6 grams of it, while Icelanders take 2.5 grams.
The recommended daily dose is 1 to 4 grams.
Hemp oil is recommended as part of a supportive diet to boost immunity and heal wounds.
It has anti-inflammatory effects and is an essential component of cell membranes.
People don't have to worry about using hemp oil, it doesn't contain any psychoactive substances.
The fact that this oil has found its way to consumers confirms the fact that it is one of the best-selling oils in Bohemia Oil.
It sells 500 liters a year.
People often take one tablespoon of this food after a long meal.
Hemp oil is not taste-inducing, but it does greatly boost immunity, advised Daniel Wolf of Bohemia Oil, a giant oil company.
According to statistics, the American barbecue is the most daring nation.
That's 1.4 grams per household.
A variety of grilling competitions are held around the world, and this is just a testament to the culinary success of the discipline.
There's not even a Czech in the back.
Based on consumer surveys of the Czech market, we find that only 4% of people have been Negro in their lifetime.
Most people barbeque a few times a year.
To make grilling successful, the preparation must not be underestimated - the ideal way is to marinate the meat a few hours before heat treatment.
What oil is best for this and at the same time leaves healthy ingredients on the grill?
In general, the process of grilling itself should save fat.
Experts agree that a large part of oils begin to lose their flavor at high temperatures.
Healthy extra virgin oils also lose the body's beneficial properties that we otherwise derive from consuming oils from foods cooked at lower temperatures.
But that doesn't mean that extra virgin oils won't be used in grilling.
A grease for grilling, health and beauty.
When it comes to meat, the experts at Bohemia Oil from Kraslic in Sokolovsk will immediately supply grape oil.
It's a wonderful addition to the taste of meat and fish.
The kitchen has a unique feature of enhancing the natural taste of food.
It is also suitable for frying and grilling, as it has a high degree of combustion, up to 216 °C.
Even at such high temperatures, as one of the few oils to retain a health benefit, Daniel Vlček of Bohemia Olej, one of the few Czech producers of this wine oil, describes the benefits of grape oil.
Experts agree that grape oil is 50 times more effective than vitamin E and 20 times more effective than vitamin C.
It also contains high levels of linoleic acid and is therefore effective in controlling excess cholesterol.
Grape oil also provides our bodies with essential unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.
Thanks to its beneficial content, it helps to lower high blood pressure, increases metabolism and has a positive effect on the kidneys.
Grape oil also helps to enhance our appearance - it improves skin elasticity, is used to treat acne, and helps to treat dry and brittle hair.
The chefs praise the use of grape oil in the kitchen.
It is not only suitable for preparing cold foods, such as salads, but also for cooking food in the heat.
So there are two ways to use it in grilling, marinating and grilling itself.
By marinating meat and fish, we preserve their juiciness.
When preparing marinade, three ingredients must be present: oil, acidity and spices.
So, we add acid to the meat, like apple cider vinegar, and we'll make the meat softer.
The spices add flavor to the dough, and the oil preserves and delivers the right cut, advises Daniel Wolf.
He also adds that grape oil is perfect for marinating because it is one of the few oils that can penetrate dark meat.
So, marinated meat or fish are ready to grill, how do we move on?
Extra virgin oils are characterized by the fact that only a few drops are needed to prepare the dish.
The same goes for barbecues.
Some oils are taboo for this method of preparation.
This applies in particular to flax, hemp and rapeseed oil, which should not be heated at all.
Before grilling itself, rinse the grill with oil to prevent food from burning.
The preparation of the ingredients is also an essential part of the grill.
Barbecue meat and fish are good for just about anything - grilled vegetables, baked bread, light vegetable salad, and more.
Chefs from Bohemia Oil recommend hot summer salad, for example.
You need: • 1 tablespoon of peaches • 1 roll of slices • 1 cup of chopped cucumbers • 1 cup of salad blends • 3 tablespoons of grape oil
Add a hand-picked lettuce, chopped cucumbers and chopped peaches to the salad bowl.
Depending on the taste of the donkey and the pickle, you can also have ground chili and soy sauce.
Finally, dip a few drops of grape oil.
For a special taste, you can sprinkle the salad with finely chopped almonds.
Multiple sclerosis: Not only depends on the medication, but also on the patient's willingness to fight.
Multiple sclerosis is a complicated disease and a person diagnosed with it needs the care of a number of specialists: a neurologist, a physical therapist, an ergotherapist, a urologist, an ophthalmologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and many other specialists.
However, it is not just about medical care, for example women with multiple sclerosis also need counselling if they decide to have a child, social legal advice, housing recommendations, etc.
Yet, all this is not enough: the patient himself can be profoundly affected by the disease.
The more he actively fights the disease, the longer he can work and the more he may need to make drastic changes to his lifestyle.
As doctors point out, the passivity of the sick leaves room for disease activity.
For example, regular exercise has been shown to significantly delay the time when a patient needs some form of compensatory assistance, such as a stick.
It is important that patients and their environment avoid the myths that the disease automatically leads to their being confined to a wheelchair.
That's why the Give Yourself a Chance website (www.bezmytu.cz) was created, which is supported by the ongoing Give Yourself a Chance media campaign.
The most important person in the care of a sick person with multiple sclerosis is a neurologist.
In the case of multiple sclerosis, the more the disease is treated, the more the doctor can influence.
That's because we have drugs for multiple sclerosis in an inflammatory stage, when the neurodegeneration process isn't that strong yet.
The sooner we intervene, the more hopeful we are that we will be able to stop the disease and delay disabling, explains Dr. Eva Med of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Rehabilitation care is very important for people with multiple sclerosis, which most often addresses lower limb weakness or imbalance.
The patient is treated according to their individual needs: to maintain fitness, improve walking, strengthen the pelvic floor, alleviate swallowing disorders or improve coordination.
"It's really individual, depending on the patient's specific problems", says Dr. Martin Kövári, principal of the Molla Faculty Hospital's Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic.
Although people with multiple sclerosis have the same disease, each person has a slightly different manifestation.
Rehabilitation can't stop the disease, but it can always ease its symptoms.
However, exercise also boosts the body's immune system, which is desirable in the case of multiple sclerosis.
Another benefit of regular exercise is that the sick person checks their skills, and this increases their confidence.
"Exercise also releases endorphins and makes you feel good", notes Dr. Kamila Řas of the Rehabilitation Clinic of the Faculty Hospital of the Royal Vineyard.
By influencing the physical side, we influence the limbic system responsible for emotions.
It directly interferes with the psyche and immune processes and stabilizes the disease, he adds.
"In the past, these so-called patients were being sparing, but now we know they need a targeted load", says Professor PaedDr. Pavel Kolář, head of the Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Clinic at the Faculty Hospital in Motol.
The goal of physical therapy is to keep a person self-sufficient for as long as possible, including employment.
Physiotherapists therefore work with ergotherapists to provide each person with a compensatory aid tailored to them.
Many patients also need the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist.
They're in a difficult life situation.
When a serious illness comes into your life, most people will shake it.
They're in shock, panic, fear.
He must respond to a great burden - loss of health.
With a soul that's so broken, we should go to someone, not try to carry everything on our own shoulders.
"I work with them to finally conclude that even with a disability, a full life can be lived and that sclerosis does not mean the end of life", says psychotherapist Renata Malin-Schubert of the Neurological Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague.
Without the Prague manufacturer Latecoere, the airbuses would not fly.
Aviation production is synonymous with precision and advanced technology.
The new planes are full of titanium or lightweight, solid composite materials that no one can make or process right away.
Yet, next to super-precision, computer-controlled machine tools, next to composite-forming autoclaves, you can come across something as simple as mercury-based stoves.
In a drum that resembles a pot of cotton candy, the edges of the sheet metal just emerged from the mill are mistaken in the pile of ovens.
"Nobody has come up with anything better yet", smiles Ivan Dubský, CEO of the air door manufacturer Latecoere Czech Republic.
In the Prague Summer Camp, the former Flight manufactures a complete door for the Airbus A320.
They're the only one in the world to supply doors for the Brazilian Embraer 170.
The doors, part of which is assembled in Prague, also enter passengers of the first and upper class on the upper decks of the world's largest transport aircraft Airbus A380.
There's also a door full of composites for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Accuracy is the motto here.
Maybe the moment keys are being repaired twice a year.
If the yellow label lacks a check record, they should explain to the Airbus or Boeing auditors at the Prague plant who regularly check whether the doors are manufactured according to the agreed rules.
But human senses have not yet been fully replaced by advanced technology.
There's 1,500 knots on one of the A320 doors.
These users have to hand-clean.
It'll take them two days.
Even the sound of the hammer hitting them will tell if it's already properly fastened.
The tolerance they're moving is minimal.
The yarn may be stretched from zero to 0.13 mm above the surface of the aircraft.
That's about twice the thickness of a human hair.
A trained man comes along when you check.
When the controller runs a string of threads, it will know if any are out of tolerance.
He'll be able to use a precise diversionometer.
The aircraft was fed by the L-39 military training program prior to 1989.
But in 1991, none were made.
The company had to find new contracts quickly.
It was then that she teamed up with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
She won the bid for the emergency door supplier for the A321.
The Boeing talks weren't that happy.
"We were a small company for them at the time, which did not have enough money to invest and to guarantee long-term stable deliveries to Boeing", recalls Dubsky.
The door to the American manufacturer would have remained closed if Letov had not engaged the French group Latecoere at the Prague conference of the International Aircraft Association in 1999.
I was talking about our cooperation with Airbus.
The next day, negotiations with the French began, Dubski says.
A year later Latecoere bought the Czech company and a strong company entered into new contracts.
As early as 2000, the installation of the door section for the A320 began.
Three years later, the doors to the upper deck for the A380 were added.
In 2006, the company built a new composite processing facility for Boeing Dreamliner deliveries.
Without Latecoer, we wouldn't have made these big deals ourselves.
Maybe we could make parts or small parts.
The partners want a guarantee of 20 or 30 years' supply, Dubsky explains.
Last year, the Czech Latecoere made a turnover of over 2.9 billion and a profit after tax of 147 million crowns.
Exclusive status among aircraft manufacturers' suppliers is not free.
Latecoere in Prague has invested 1.5 billion crowns since 2000.
The company must have quality certificates, 170 specific production process certificates and key employee qualifications certificates.
Without them, the company wouldn't be building any airplane doors.
To obtain certificates that the manufacturing processes meet customer requirements and to maintain them in repeated checks is worth Dubski million crowns.
The manufacturing processes change every year.
They're more accurate and rigorous.
We need to train the staff, equip the equipment and re-certify the entire process, Dubsky adds.
Now the company is completing the preparation of a zinc and nickel spraying process to replace the previously harmful cadmium to human health.
They were given the assignments by the manufacturer, but then they had to adapt the technology to the equipment or chemicals they use in Prague.
People from Boeing will come and check the concept of the entire line.
Then we'll show them the production.
They'll check our lab, too.
They test a set of samples themselves in their lab, and then compare the results to ours, which is a close approximation of the way customers check them.
The reward for the Prague firm is long-term exclusive contracts.
With the Prague plant today, the production of embracers stands up and falls.
For the A320 it produces half of the total volume of doors.
Replacing Czech Latecoere is either impossible or very difficult for a Brazilian or European producer.
But that doesn't mean he can say anything behind the door.
Part of the contract is the price curve.
It tells you how many doors each door will cost after 10 or 50 pieces.
The price per piece keeps falling to a certain threshold.
We need to get into this price pattern.
If not, we'll lose, Dubsky says.
Half the hall where the electrical cabinets for the Airbus A400 M military aircraft are being assembled is empty.
But it's a symbol of the future.
Behind the curtain, a new semi-robotic door assembly line is being built for the A320 Neo.
The breeding will be accelerated and precise.
"This is the trend in aviation assembly", adds Dubsky.
The future line is secured.
Airbus reports that the airlines have so far ordered 3278 new A320.
Just a few yards away, there's a line for the complete installation of the A380 front door.
It's a strategic decision for our parent company.
The aim is to reduce production times and reduce costs.
Full assembly could begin in two years, Dubski says.
However, before that, the company must undergo qualification tests, such as for the installation of certain electrical and electronic equipment in the doors of the largest Airbus.
The company also plans to further develop its composite materials production.
In addition to Boeing, she will also be involved in the new Airbus A350 program, which will compete with the American Dreamliner.
"It's a huge credit to the company to be able to process metal materials and composites", Dubsky says proudly.
Latecoere is, however, on the verge of production capacity in the Czech Republic.
There's no other place in the lot where he lives.
Before the French mother came in, the company had 180 employees.
Now he's 800, and in three years there could be a hundred more.
As long as Airbus and Boeing are ahead of the curve, how many hundreds of new planes airlines order each year, they don't have to worry about jobs.
Although it has contracts for several years ahead of it, the parent company of Prague's Latecoere faced the threat of bankruptcy.
The French group didn't have enough money to pay off the September loan.
Latecoere finally managed to reach a settlement with the major creditors.
At the end of August, she traded some of their loans for shares.
The creditors gained a 37.4% stake in the company by raising EUR 57,4 million in capital.
The company's debt fell by two thirds, or 180 million euros.
The second part of the financial recovery came in early September.
The company listed new shares among the existing shareholders for EUR 222,9 million.
In total, it raised its share capital by EUR 280 million.
The group benefits from the growing production of Airbus and Boeing, which account for 85% of the sales.
The average growth in contracts is expected to be 4% per year until 2017.
He has orders for €2.6 billion in the order book, which is equivalent to four years of production.
French media say Latecoere can finally breathe again after years on the hood.
The Czech race in Prague Summer is important for the group.
It contributes 16 percent to the group's revenue.
The largest foreign branch of the group is in terms of number of employees.
Members supported a larger share of the state's coal tariffs.
The change in the mining fees is expected to bring in a further KK 427 million to the State Treasury compared to 2013.
The government believes that the budget revenue of municipalities should be neutral because the fee is higher.
Last year, municipalities received about 450 million crowns from fees and the state budget 150 million crowns.
The coal mining industry has earned about 200 million crowns for municipalities and 66 million crowns for the state.
The new plan also calls for an increase in the payment of the permitted mining fees per hectare per year to 1,000 crowns.
The revenue from these payments shall continue to be fully owned by the municipalities.
Industry Minister Jan Mladek (ČSSD) told the deputies that municipalities would get from 14 million to 100 million crowns a year instead.
The amount of mining fees will no longer be determined by law, but by government regulation.
The remuneration shall be calculated as a sum of the quantity of mineral extracted and the rate for each mineral species.
The government believes that the reason for the change is, inter alia, the possibility of a flexible response to the current economic situation.
However, ODS Member Marek Benda warned that setting a fee by government decree may not be in line with the Constitution.
However, according to Minister Mladek, it is not a tax in this case, because the state charges the mineral that is state property.
The fees are only paid to municipalities whose territory is affected by the mining.
In the case of deep coal mining, three quarters of the money will go to the municipality and a quarter to the state.
The same ratio will be applied to the extraction of radioactive rocks.
A portion of the money collected by the State on the mining charges will be tied up on purpose.
For example, 28 percent will have to go to repair damage after mining or to secure a mine rescue service.
The proposal was criticized by opposition MPs today, who argued in particular that it would harm mining-affected communities and counties.
For example, Michal Kucher (TOP 09 and the Mayor) warned that mining companies would no longer want to sponsor municipalities as they did before, because they would pay higher fees directly into the state budget.
"It is not possible to tunnel one of the poorest regions just to get the finance minister to improve his budget", said David Kádner (Usvit), elected in Ustek region.
The UN Security Council has warned of the rise in unemployment in Mostecka.
Kadner and Aulika unsuccessfully proposed rejecting the novel, and Kucher wanted the law back in the government for further development.
The reasoning states that the mining companies claim that the increase in fees will not be reflected in coal prices because prices are more than 90% long-term.
The main consumers, such as power plants or heat plants, should not feel the increase in prices.
'On the other hand, this increases the risk that mining organisations will compensate for the increase in payments by trying to reduce their operating expenses, which would primarily mean reducing the number of employees,' the government admits.
However, it considers that the increase in fees in terms of employment is acceptable.
According to the rapporteur for the Milan Urbana report (ČSSD), it is crucial that MEPs know the conclusions on the updated energy concept and, above all, the government's decision on coal limits before the law is passed.
If coal is extracted beyond the limits, then it will have an impact on the revenues for the state and the municipality, he stressed.
Urban disagrees with Mladáček that the decision to break the border at the bottom of the Czechoslovak army should not be taken until 2020.
The limits on ČSA mining should be broken down already for social, national economic and long-term stability of domestic energy.
Time for the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the U.S. Federal Reserve meets in two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a crucial decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would make decisions now think they would stay inactive for a while longer and keep interest rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because seven years have passed since the Fed cut rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank could be able to get out of the zero loop and start the process of normalizing interest rates", says Angel Ubide, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The American economy was doing pretty well, there was a recovery in the form of adding trillions of dollars to the national account and creating only low inflation levels.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy global perspective.
They warned markets to be prepared for the increase, but the circumstances suggest that they also see a great opportunity against this move.
The decision is to be notified by Thursday at 20:00 CET.
The shooter at Delta State University left a message.
Shannon Lamb, who shot his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday - and later that day his colleague - wrote a note saying he was sorry for the first murders and wished he could take it back, government officials revealed Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called police around 10 a.m. on Monday.
And he said he shot someone.
Lamb asked the dispatcher to send officers to his house.
He said, "I shot my wife last night and he also mentioned that there's a cute dog in the house that won't bother anyone but is upset".
The police asked for the caller's name, but Lamb didn't show up.
Lamb also didn't explain why the house was shot.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note from Lamb that said, "I'm so sorry and I wish I could take it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only person who ever loved me.
After leaving a message, Lamb set off on a 300-mile journey to Delta University, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt and then took his own life.
Dean William LaForge said he didn't know of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that something was obviously going on in Mr. Lamb's head.
Despite Monday's statement that Lamb allegedly believed in Amy Prentiss' romantic relationship with Schmidt, government officials said there was no evidence of a love triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for over seven years, said she was a great person.
The divorce was 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Steen and Prentiss' 19-year-old daughter was shocked by the whole case.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Linsday Knowles, Prentiss's close friend, as reported by the Sun Herald, Prentiss worked from home over the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a hunting dog named Blesk, dated Lamb for about three years.
She always wanted to help others, she let Knowles hear her.
Police said Lamb spoke to his relatives on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
When police caught him on the freeway near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
According to his resume posted on the school's website, Lamb earned his doctorate in education from Delta University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that lost their magic
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has a number of stressful years behind him.
In 2001, he battled leukemia and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly had a drug problem and was arrested in 2008 for drug possession.
All these things are definitely taking their toll.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out for a couple of months for a double fracture.
Luke Shaw suffered a double right leg fracture during Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this left-back has left this injury in tears and kept him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains positive and thinks Shaw could play again at the end of the season.
The injury was caused by Hector Morena's reckless action in the 15th minute when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and also needed an oxygen mask before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He suffered a double leg fracture and is now in hospital".
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after tomorrow and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible -- a guy who comes to Manchester at 18 has a really hard time, but he plays fantastic, and then this happens.
When he was in the locker room, he also had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but a double leg fracture will require six months of treatment and will not be able to play in the group stage.
I believe he's gonna play this season.
Moreno was lucky not to get a red card and a penalty kick.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gall suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if it was a penalty and a red card.
It was a very ugly operation on both legs.
Shawa's tweet reads, "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how devastated I am, my journey to recovery begins now and I will return even stronger".
Related: Manchester United reported Luke Shaw injured in a defeat to PSV
The English defender will have an extra boost to his recovery in the form of the European Championship in France next July.
"It was a very bad injury", said PSV coach Phillip Cocu.
When any player leaves the field with such an injury, everyone is very sad.
It's never our players' goal to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg in a match for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him because he didn't mean to hurt the opponent, and when you hear about the severity of such an injury, it's not good", Coco said.
I wasn't able to see this moment.
I just saw the ball going the other way, so it looked like [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's move.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how he feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel very bad about this, I'm very sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after the operation of Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
Every parent knows this: When a child loves a book, it doesn't take long for him to learn it by heart.
But you can't be David Cameron.
When asked by the children's book company to name a favorite children's book, Prime Minister Lorax chose a 1971 Dr. Seuss fairy tale.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a report published on the SuperCamps website, and he continues: "Funny, moving, creative, and powerful, and I loved reading to my children because there was always a picture or message behind it that I hadn't seen before".
Well, except that in the next paragraph Cameron reportedly described the book from a trailer for the 2012 movie, which added additional characters and details to fill in the original text.
"In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", is a brief account of the book that records the object of love of an unknown Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads like a summary of the film Lorax, which is available on the Internet Movie Database, and begins with the words: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has ceased to exist, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Being an openly practical parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron would have been unaware of the events of the book, where an unnamed young man learns that the local nature is being ravaged by a rough, tree-shrimping industrialist Once-ler, who despite the protests of the titular Lorax, a crumpled, scaly creature who "speaks for the trees".
Most likely, a relatively insignificant PR assignment was given to an assistant who never read the Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's employee, but without further comment.
Adam Lyth was in danger of being forgotten by England, but still holds
To compete against Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but after looking at the team England has chosen for this tour, I think it's highly unlikely that a repeat of the 3-0 defeat suffered in the last test series will be possible.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win either.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but there are good players in the backfield in this batting lineup and the collective thinking is strong; they're not going to carry the scars of 2012, just youth positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a developing spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test series level, represents an offensive possibility.
Adam Lyth was dropped from the England team in the Test series and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to ignore Adam Lythe is a tough one for me to analyze, because his head coach is in Yorkshire.
His seven tests were against two good strikes in tough conditions and the simple but tough reality is that cricketers are judged on their performance.
For example, there were no questionnaires around the name Joe Root, which led to the announcement, because  and I mentioned this before  players are their best selectors.
A few more half-centuries and Lyth could have extended his series, but he had control over his own destiny.
Let's hope that if he can get more runs for Yorkshire, another opportunity will arise.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude, even though his performance was not 100%, and that doesn't surprise me; he was always a team player.
The question of how much time a batsman gets to prove himself is a tough one.
Lyth got seven caps, as did Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got a chance at home and away.
The only thing you could argue about is that England gave Jonathan Trott the first chance in the Caribbean, even though Lyth was in his best form, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and this is a batsman that I rate very positively.
He's an X-factor cricketer we saw here in Yorkshire at the start of the season, getting 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which kind of made him.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but of course it will all depend on the overall composition in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen starting off next to Cook, who would get another extra spinner while keeping four quicks, was fueled up, and I have no objections to it.
I don't understand why a strokemaker can't fire and this left-handed man has already proven himself to be an amazing cricketer.
Moeen may not be able to do his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he was number three for them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer first played his first 38 tests before making his debut in 2001.
He made three centuries in a flash and he didn't even look.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a backup spinner and when I had the chance to watch him, he impressed me as a very impressive young man.
People can look at his rough stats  average 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball  and I see that as a springboard, but there aren't many spinners to raise their hands, and the selectors have chosen for the youth.
There's a lot to learn on this tour.
Outside the team, it seems England has made some changes and clever additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Michael Jayawardene as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterpiece.
He's one of the most beautiful playmates who brings a wealth of experience by having experience with all the conditions and all the attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming in on the white-ball tour and bringing energy and a relentless spark to the team.
I always felt that he was born into the world of international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Michael, he had an intellect that could be used.
New voices in the wardrobe, even if they are consistent voices that have been said before, can sometimes lighten and refresh the atmosphere.
Colly Durham's teammate Ben Stokes was given a day off, just like Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with that decision.
Although many disagree, coaches and selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, that their work is about the results.
Such a decision can never be taken lightly.
The Brexit campaign could win if the economy stagnates by 2017.
David Cameron's unthinkable renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting into more trouble with each passing day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leadership of the Labour Party, or if the TUC takes over the whole situation around Europe on Tuesday.
The aliens also have their Corbyn and Nigel Faragese.
A close friend of the European diplomat recently explained how Europe is sinking into various crises - not all of which are their fault - some Member States already have enough of the British self-centered agendas, dividing concessions and disruptive changes to the treaty that most of them did not want.
At their annual meeting in Brighton, TUC decided they didn't want to do that even if they were putting up welfare.
We could even call it a selfie agenda for Dave and George.
The prime minister and the chancellor go to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign metropolises, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without local dignitaries, and then come home with the words that they're winning the Alliance for Reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants an unseen Britain in European Europe -- "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin -- suggests that some short-sighted ministers and officials in some major cities have reached a point where they don't care about our departure.
Angela Merkel, the cautiously balanced German chancellor, is an ally but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave her post before it gets bad for her, as was the case with the long-running Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
Frenchman François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It's hard to watch them break their legs with the help of British selfies who could have better invested their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - which is something they don't want to do because they have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, a friend of mine says.
"Re-negotiation has resolved the issue" and "Britain has nothing of value from negotiation".
Europeans know to their own detriment how rapacious Fleet Street can be and how skeptical of the EU are the oligarchic barons of the press, because they were not in the 1975 Tony Bennett-inspired referendum that supported our entry into 1973 in a 2:1 ratio.
They may remember the name of Boris Johnson, the brilliant Euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as a Brussels correspondent for EU straight bananas in the early 1990s.
Despite his generosity, Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included a mix of tax-defying crooks, foreigners hacking phones, and the pseudo-offshore departments that owned most of the major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same thing about them, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a mad gorilla, you have to throw her bananas so she doesn't have you for dinner and then tea.
In fact, Miliband was more like Blair than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum routine since Blair accepted the principle of the repealed EU constitution, which was flooded by French and Dutch voters in 2005 and earned him a dismissal card.
The press never forgave him either.
But the dear Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him not to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the strategy of the Murdoch boycott of Neil Kinnock, which was a mistake then and now.
It may take some time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy for media engagement, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose chair at the BBC he left on Sunday.
Corbin's official attitude towards Europe is, I'll say politely, evolving.
He says he wants to stay in the reformed European Union.
Well, most people outside the rage of Ukip and the wild shores of Tory little Englandism can certainly step up to it.
Hilary "Bemm, but not Benniite" Benn said the same thing on radio and television this week when his inner scout couldn't be more determined to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the abrasive McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad decision.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his grandfather was fighting for his loyalty on television without going too far and losing his job.
Hillary's game was much more attractive.
But fighting to stay "in all circumstances" - Benn's phrase - was apparently not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and MPs at their private meeting on Monday night,
Whatever the background, whatever the sensitive image Corbyn wants to convey - don't forget, it touched me too - the discipline of news remains important in this age of all-day television broadcasting and especially in the faith, the legacy of paranoia and betrayal that social media is.
It's fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe that would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental twist on EU membership - in line with their Bennite-encompassing, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom narcissism of small differences is central to dogmatic harassment.
Just like his NATO twist - Tom Watson is convinced that the JC campaign won't want to end it - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand what it's all about for their homeowners.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - even suspicious voters have it - on British concessions when it seems unnecessary?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the "low military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, including reducing the cost of the Conservative government in power", as I was reminded at the launch of what was called the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the electronic reviews published by Public Health England
The government-funded agency's statement that e-cigarettes are 95 percent safer than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are connected to the tobacco industry, the researchers say.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) have joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
The PHE Agency published a "milestone" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, several researchers questioned the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editor in the Lancet last month attacked a "extremely fragile base" on which PHE was basing its main conclusions.
Two other experts writing for the BMJ questioned the claim, which was reportedly "built on rock or sand".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic principle of public health is that policy should be evidence-based".
They say the public could expect that the PHE claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this conclusion comes from a meeting of 12 people called to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harm associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in the research report.
McKee and Capewell state that one sponsor of this meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO had previously allegedly received funding from British American Tobacco for independent studies.
It also approved the BAT public health mandate in the Sustainability Report, it states.
One of the 12 participants admitted to receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but they do not provide funding that he allegedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reason for the selection of panel members is not available, but they contain several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also announce industry funding in the newspapers.
Some of the others present are not known for their smoking-fighting expertise.
The tobacco management also attended the meeting at PHE.
The report in this group "exclusively admits the absence of 'strong evidence of harmfulness to most products on most criteria,'" wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these references or restrictions are described in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes act as a smoking pathway for children or nonsmokers" was premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellness at PHE, said the BMJ's claim had been answered earlier.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies of their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we still need to investigate their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there has been so much public confusion about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly emphasizing the current evidence - that while e-cigarettes are not risk-free, they only carry a fraction of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should end EastEnders, says former Channel 4 director
Former Channel 4 director Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, and confirmed that its commercial rivals would "give a right hand" to hit shows like Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used for programmes not made up of other British television broadcasts.
He criticised the BBC for having deployed public service programmes that are likely to be watched by only a handful of people, at complex broadcasting times compared to its rivals' biggest ratings show, and on channels such as BBC4.
After CEO Tony Hall said the corporation wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to connect with the BBC for the entire six years he had worked on Channel 4.
"I struggle with the idea that the BBC is commissioning and broadcasting programmes that would certainly be broadcast by rivals without state contributions", Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of the BBC's future negotiations.
If you keep the licensing fees, which I'm not sure are a good idea in the medium or long term, you should cut production at least for programs that others don't produce or deliver.
They're broadcasting The Voice in prime time because they want to get the broadest possible support for the future.
The idea that no one else would send it is a ridiculous joke, and of course, it's pointless.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why a regressive tax should support programs that can be funded without contributions.
The Voice is one of them, EastEnders another, and of course, produced on home soil.
Honestly, other channels would be willing to lend a hand.
I can't understand how these are public broadcasting.
I don't think it would have weakened the BBC in the slightest.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, told the BBC that he felt guilty for pushing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who worked here, and because he believed it was the best way to secure long-term support".
His commentary on the BBC's most popular shows echoes those of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his MacTaggart lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to suggest that the BBC sell the show as EastEnders.
Johnson said even the most hyped public service programmes of the BBC "go to BBC4, where quite often they cannot measure the audience but they do exercise their authority and can argue when they are about to undertake their hypocritical mission of justifying £4bn in licence fee income, "but of course we do all these obscene programmes that nobody is looking at".
They're broadcasting at times when no one's watching.
As for the license fee, Johnson told the commission, "I urge you to find a more regressive system for who gets the best value.
Of course, we all think that £150 a year is a big sum, but for people who are £150 a lot, I would be surprised if they paid that much, because they don't watch the BBC that much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 director David Elstein, who appeared before the commission on Tuesday, said the BBC should revise its Reith mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He confirmed that the small volume of BBC production was now classified as educational - it was 1% television production and 0.1% radio - and should take the pattern of public broadcasting in Australia and Canada and change to "inform, clarify and entertain".
On the theme of the partnership, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the Proms, which were only a handful of TV shows, and connect with commercial reporters so we can all see them online.
Sonogenetics or control of brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how sound pulses affect the direction in which particles move.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can control sound waves.
Small particles change direction when they are hit by sound pulses that are unheard of by the human ear.
Pulses work by switching on cells of genetically modified motor neurons that are programmed to respond to these ultrasonic waves.
Related: Scientists can read and record brain activity using light
Scientists said that these worms are a fine example of a new method called sonogenetics, which uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart, and muscle cells and activates itself outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that this method could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrodes are fed into the patient's brain that stimulate the brain.
The noises don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that the reaction comes when he places them in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves that then pass through the worm's body.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act in the TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Sound waves open and activate the cells to which they are connected, reports Nature Communications.
To control the worms using ultrasonic waves, Chalasani genetically modified the worms by making some of their motor neurons contain TRP-4 ion channels.
Then when he used ultrasound on the modified worms, the sound waves were amplified by microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turned on the modified motor neurons.
The new method is similar in many ways to optogenetics, a pioneering tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons using light.
But Chalasani has been told that sonogenetics could have many advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent by optical fiber to a desired location in the brain, ultrasound waves can penetrate tissue without restriction and be sent directly to the brain.
"We believe that by using gene therapy and therapeutic viruses, we can target human neurons and make them temporarily sensitive to ultrasound signals used in clinical treatment to treat neurological diseases", Chalasani said.
He added that the method would also be used to treat muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture facilities - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements that disgrace the British arms trade.
Watch the video on the anti-arms market from Amnesty International.
The most formidable killer drones!
Chains on the legs that break the ankles!
Shots fired!
And electrically stunning drums that cause unbearable pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the metaphorical cartoon leave no doubt that this ad at the world's largest arms shows is a sharp parody created for Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to sell arms to repressive regimes through the International Cheerleading Centre's defence and security facilities in the London Docklands.

But a separate campaign is also being run with posters popping up at bus stops and meters that require a second look.
"Important announcement, Traveling to the DPRK from September 15 to 18?" reads one, using the font of the London Underground with DPR lines becomes a tank image.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will descend on the DPRK... customers are being asked to help stop the arms trade.
300 posters are created by artists who exhibit their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped distribute them across London and with "Ad Space Hack Packs", which is £6 per piece of Allen's key, which reportedly "gives access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this flyposting "vandalism".
One of the commercial parodies produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a technical assistant at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and trying to show political activity to audiences outside the gallery.
Many artists are moving to work with activists in protest movements and realize that they have to get out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another one of the posters against the gun trade greets subway passengers.
The video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the non-payment agency VCCP and the graphic designer and commentator also worked for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever would be surprised by the silence surrounding the gun trade ads - he saw a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's show them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They were playing with creating more realistic, risky corporate ads, but "by adding a variety of colors and animations, we aimed to attract more people".
"They did a fantastic job and helped raise concerns about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the UK government to take action to ensure that torture facilities are not illegally trafficked on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art surrounding the arms trade comes from within ExCeLu, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the US military for an "AT4CS RS shoulder-firing missile".
This includes "a uniquely shaped head that provides amazing effects from behind the armor inside the target".
Whatever it is, it's not going to be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for college life
11 years ago, I moved to student college as a neglected 19-year-old boy, still believing in baret and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I bothered -- and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Everything I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The movement on the track can range from mild to nervous to totally shocking.
It's tempting to gossip: tell people where you're from, if you've taken a year off, what you think of Corbyn, and why "you don't really love or hate Marmite, because people, it's just a little extract of HAHAHA yeast, I'll be in my room".
Take a deep breath.
And help others to breathe, too - ask questions and show interest.
It's the conversation controller and it helps you find the people you love, and the people you wouldn't bother with even if your algae were on fire and they were putting out extinguishers.
Give people a space.
People's rooms often change into drinking receptions, movie venues, and communal public spaces, but they're also rooms where people dress and dress their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college and being in a relationship
Introverts are gonna be in college for a while.
Your room should be a refuge, yet many tracks are turning into an off-rooms walking culture that is friendly, social and contributes to lifelong friendships.
That could be hell for someone who needs to charge.
No culture allows you to say, "I love you and I want our friendship to go on, but I need you to leave so I can get back to the energy I used to talk to you".
Try to identify when a classmate is tired of socializing - and perhaps write a knock-in.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
One of my boys used to say if the door wasn't locked, he'd be invited in.
He saw a few things.
Make friends with baking.
Because you started college on top of a baking frenzy, knocking on someone else's door and showing off a pan of baked pies seems a little less weird, less than, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I made you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions".
Giving homework is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to talk to you, and perhaps your face will be a pleasant surprise.
That's the thing about being a decent baker.
Poorly condensed pieces of flour, sugar, and yeast are likely to ensure that others will pretend to sleep when you try to knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in college.
Stealing whole chicken is a crime, of course, but is a drop of milk in your tea theft?
Check it twice with the milkman.
There's a chance they'll offer you milk even if they're angry inside.
If someone steals something from you, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy -- but try to deal with it a little more mature than my roommate, who traded her milk for a dishwasher to punish the thieves.
He's in prison now.
You shouldn't make sounds that distract people from sleep or study.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you're also famous people in glass houses.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbors if they could turn down the drum and bass, because it was 3 in the morning and she had a note.
Their response was to amplify the music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she let them sleep for two hours, then played her own music, locked the door, and went to her three-hour paper.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife went to the same track as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be terribly embarrassing if you mistaken your roommate for your future lust, slept with her, broke up, and had to see each other every day, and maybe she would take control of your mutual friends, too?
Of course, you won't hurt your heart - but if your sexy roommate is not your future desire, at least try to talk to her about your weaknesses.
In the uplifting moment when you realize someone left the keys in their unlocked room, there's only a thin line between fun and bullying.
A good joke is funny, but it's easy to fix.
Teach them a valuable and fun lesson about their safety by hiding something from them - never toothpaste or shampoo in someone's room.
Lock the door and put the keys in a bottle of water, then put them in the freezer - but never stick their stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Eve looked forward to the twins despite uncertain prospects.
Eva has been through a rough patch while pregnant with the seven-year-old Witch.
His father broke up with her and she was alone in training and raising the offspring.
I quickly coped with the situation - I was looking forward to having a baby and looking for the positive in it.
Not knowing, and being alone with the baby, I tried not to worry.
And I certainly had hopes that we wouldn't be alone for long, Eve recalls today of her first pregnancy.
She met an older man named Vashk on the Internet, and they started talking about his favorite movies.
Your grandfather even brought Eve home from the midwifery, but he didn't get too involved in the role of a stepdad.
"He then withdrew from the program for a while", Eva described in the documentary series Four in Volume 3.
The third series of the Czech TV series is about finding happiness on a second attempt.
She managed to provide for Vitka and the financial security of her family through part-time work and the help of her mother and aunt.
Even the prospects of responsibility for a foreign child did not ultimately ruin Wash's affection for Eve.
They definitely got together around Vítká's second birthday and he now understands Vask as his father and addresses him as well.
Although Vazhek has two grown daughters, he enjoys fatherhood in his 60s and is more devoted to his children.
In addition to the whip, a two-year-old Leontynne and, eventually, a twin were added.
"Your love for our family came naturally, perhaps even by not telling me much about relationships", smiles Eva.
Is there room?
At least we're close.
The twins Emma and Ela were born by cesarean section after Eve was diagnosed with gestational cholestasis at the end of her pregnancy.
This is a disorder of the production and activity of bile acids, which are then found in excess in the blood of pregnant women and are manifested mainly by itching.
The disease is dangerous to the unborn fetus, which is at risk of preterm birth and death, and usually goes away on its own after birth.
Emma and Ella were born healthy to Evin and Vazkov's happiness, even though they were only 36 weeks old.
They put Amy in an incubator in the intermediate department, where Vaskov's niece also works, who was able to take her in and accommodate her.
Elinka was bigger, and right after I was transferred from the JIP to the room, I had her with me, describing the difficult time after Eva was born.
She spent 20 days in the maternity ward until doctors agreed to release the babies, who had managed to reach the two-pound limit.
Waiting for the babies to be picked up in the delivery room was not a joy for Eva.
"I was crazy about being chased by my husband and children", recalls a sixteen-year-old mother of four.
She and her husband were also considering signing a reverse, among other things because of the insensitive attitude of one of the doctors.
Eventually, however, the doctors did not, and they sent Eve and her twins to home care.
The stories of four pregnancies and childbirth are broadcast on Tuesday night at 9:45 p.m.
A very large family can afford to live.
They live together in a small house near Prague, where Eva has had to deal with electric double-decker and tight conditions.
The house did not grow, but Vazhek made Eve happy by installing a gas stove to make food for six more comfortable.
When it gets cold, we'll take turns getting a cab.
Eva is convinced that children are more likely to see the comfort and pleasant atmosphere of the home than the size or complexity of the home.
We've been getting along so much better than we thought.
Although the mess is worse in a small space, and the cuddling baby sometimes gets over us, at least we're all close, smiles Eva, who can find the positive side of every situation.
Your work as a film lighting technician is not a guarantee of regular income.
That's why he sometimes takes to the streets of Prague as a taxi driver.
In his 60s, according to his words, he can physically manage family finances and children, but how long will that be?
"I realize that one day, given our age difference, I will be the one to feed this family", Eva admits in a straightforward way when asked about the future.
She'd love to get back to work, but she's even more attracted to the possibility of running her own business.
I'm not exactly a good place for employers with four kids.
And if it gets worse, my husband and I can take turns getting a cab, jokingly, a nice blonde.
Apple has hit the yo-yo effect.
Displays can do everything.
A more powerful processor, a higher-resolution camera, a more robust chassis, or a touchscreen display - these are, in short, the advantages of the recently introduced ninth-generation iPhones.
The latter two also have a negative impact on the size and weight of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus.
The trend Apple has been making so far is that each new generation of iPhone is lighter than the previous one.
The exception was the third and fourth generations, which gained slightly more weight than the previous iPhones.
The two-gram weight difference in the disadvantages of the news was, however, really negligible.
But that's not true of new iPhones.
Compared with last year's iPhones 6 and 6 Plus, the smaller model weighed 14 grams and the larger one 20 grams.
On the one hand, it's no surprise that last year's Apple pocket-twisting affair was a big hit.
The new chassis is made of a more durable aluminium alloy 7000, which has also been reflected in weight.
But the displays have a much bigger impact on it.
Apple has used 3D Touch technology to make displays recognize touch power.
To do this, the display had to be equipped with an additional layer of capacity sensors.
The new iPhones' display weight has more than doubled compared to previous generations.
For the smaller iPhone, it's from 12 grams to 29 grams, and for the larger iPhone, it's from 19 to 40 grams.
So the iPhone 6s is the hardest component to use.
The weight of just 143 grams is also achieved in this novel by the de-secreting skin that touched most of the remaining components.
In the larger model, the heaviest component is used, but the weight has not changed compared to its predecessor.
Even in this case, the greatest increase is seen in the display.
The 5.5" iPhone 6s Plus weighs 192 grams.
The practical nature of the new display technology will be revealed only when used.
The first users will be able to try it out as early as Friday 25 September, when the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus will be launched in select countries.
Have the champs' breakfast cereal been around for tens of thousands of years?
In the Grotta Paglicci in Italy, archaeologists have made a discovery that opens up interesting possibilities.
They found traces of modern human settlement from different eras, including murals, remnants of instruments, and so on and so forth.
In layer 23A, which is dated to about 30,000 years ago, scientists have discovered something very similar to the remains of a breakfast buffet.
Traces of oat grains were found on the site, which evidently went through the process of making the popular flour today.
Today, the grain is soaked, then dried, removed from the packaging, the so-called plum, and then burned and dissolved.
In Paglicci's cave, grains were discovered that were allegedly heated or burned and then apparently crushed between two millstones - at least as evidenced by the use of two stones in the cave.
Thus, in their publication for the journal PNAS, the scientists were unable to prove that a complete process of making foam was taking place in the cave, but the similarity is indeed very striking.
We also have no evidence of how people could eat the flour, but the assumption that it was with some liquid and probably even warm, of course, is quite logical.
It is also very interesting evidence of how intensively grain was used long before agriculture.
If the flour interpretation is correct, the oldest flour predates agriculture by about 20,000 years.
New station report in the Transport Agency of the City of Brno.
So once again I listened to the reports of the names of the stops in the trolleybus:
Sure, the trolleybus was a little noisier, so reporting by a man's voice was a little less understandable than before when stops were reporting by a woman's voice.
The female voice is higher, so in the deeper traffic noise it's better recognizable than the deeper male voice.
The DPMB argues that this voter was chosen by the passengers themselves - I don't know who, nobody asked me, but they certainly picked it from studio recordings made in complete silence, which of course sounded quite different from the bus engine noise.
I have lived in Brno for a couple of decades, so I know the correct names of all the stops by heart, so I don't need this report, but foreigners from elsewhere who don't know Brno and for whom these reports are primarily intended can be confused and may end up where they have gone by mistake, then claim that the stop they were supposed to have gone to was not reported at all.
Perhaps the choice of speaker - but better yet, speaker - should be made again, this time sub-colored by the usual traffic noise and engine noise, which almost loses the sound of the bus speaker.
So we don't have to hear the names of the stations Water Hershpice, Smyrna, or the Scuba Diving in the creeping shack I stepped into in Komarov.
I guess my old hearing didn't suddenly get worse that much during the one day the stop-over voter changed.
I understood those reports pretty well the day before.
Good morning, comrade chief.
From the track records.
Today, few people know what the biggest and smartest so-called comprehensive checks were during the party's rule.
I've allowed myself to remember.
The bus was late.
I was driving into the dispatcher's office the moment the radio said it was seven o'clock.
"You're lucky you didn't crash with your comrade chief, he came a minute before you, and he seems to be in a bad mood", noted the dispatcher as I entered my arrivals book.
Thank you. I'll take care of it.
Write me a note saying I'm going to the precincts for a little mechanical repair.
It's not going to work. Today's a check-up.
Everyone's fucked up to hell.
What's the big deal?
"You'll see", the dispatcher nodded.
Next time you will.
I ran down the hall.
Then the door to the chief's office opened and the chief appeared.
Dropped, stone-faced, perfectly fitting.
"Good morning, Chief", I said respectfully, and quickly turned on two buttons of the uniform jacket.
"Good morning", the answer sounded, and I quickly ran up to the second floor, not realizing the cold, vicious tone the old man was responding to.
"You're playing", greeted me by an engineer named Eva, an elderly lady I held in high esteem.
She even was a principal before her comrades fired her.
There's a search and you'll be on the dock.
I've asked many times what these complex checks are, but no one wants to talk about it too much.
They say they live once every three years, they all have to go, and it's pretty uncomfortable.
At least for some.
I'll see.
I pulled a periodic file from the drawer and a phone.
"Here's Holcman, come right to me", the chief's voice said.
What's the matter?
Now we've met and nothing"... I muttered, but no one answered me, each with his own thoughts.
"Good morning, Comrade Chief, I came at your command", I said, barely entering the chief's quarters.
The chief was sitting at the desk looking at some leaflet.
"Companion mechanic", he said after a while, without raising his head and still looking carefully at the leaflet, "I don't like your behavior at all".
He threw the leash on the table, leaned against the seat cushion, and stared at me with a typical, unpleasant, angry, spiteful look.
I was just making sure.
What's going on? What's going on?
Yesterday, the Deputy praised me for my good work in the last few months and for his satisfaction with me.
That the chief did very well to pull me out of the platoon at a distance.
Now this?
You know, you're a track distance technician, and you have to act like one.
The greeting you used this morning is just unacceptable.
I nodded, "I've used this greeting since I was a child, I was raised that way, and I don't see anything wrong with it".
It was like a red cloth for a turkey to the chief.
"You're on the socialist railroad and the only acceptable greeting is the honor of work", recalled the overwhelmed chief.
And besides, you're still confusing the approaches to superiors.
One time you say "sir" and the other time you say "comrade".
But I'm not a master chief to you, but a fellow chief.
Deputy is a fellow deputy, top trainer is a fellow top trainer!
Please remember that!
I'm sorry, sir... Comrade Chief, but... but I greeted you with a common civil greeting.
There's nothing wrong with that... and the honor of work or the comrade... you know... I'm not on the side...
"It's not your preference not to be on the side", said the chief, who calmly said.
That's still going to be discussed.
Anyway, remember, you don't have a pension on that chair upstairs.
That wasn't good.
When the chief told someone that something was not his preference, it didn't look good with the person in question.
For a moment he stared at me with a cold, peckish look, and I looked for words to answer.
I was also annoyed by his high-pitched cough.
He was only a few years older and he played the god, actually, comrade-in-arms.
Zoological, inflated, authoritarian, arrogant, as he thought right now.
He's been kicked out of the house.
Well, he's the chief.
Actually, not everyone, the chairman of the party organization, like all party members, but also non-partisans, was a bully.
But the chief was a scorn to many, especially those with whom he could exercise his superiority.
He just called me a complete piece of shit.
I was thinking about the ass, and it took me a long enough time not to shoot him in the face.
But I wouldn't go back to the grocery store, let alone be a clerk.
What would I feed two kids with?
And the dismantled mansion!
I was in a hurry, but I was in control.
I'm not gonna make him happy.
"That's all for now, you can go", the chief finished the audience and began again to look carefully at the leaflet he had previously held.
I got a call at 12:30.
Everyone in the office was already there, and when asked what and how, they said yes, that it would be good.
Only Jojin spoke out loud, as was his custom, that they could not fire us all, because the Comrade Chief would have to do the job himself with his loyal ones, and that he was not threatened.
The word "comrade" made it seem as if he knew what the old man had thrown at me this morning.
There was a nice meeting at the headquarters.
Comrade Chief at his desk and at the long desk of the other comrades who were to decide whether or not I should be an official.
Staff director, ROH chairman, staff writer, special-purpose referent, something about the military counter-attack, and a deputy, my boss.
And most importantly, the chairman of the party organization.
I knew him from the strike.
A common railroad worker, beat a barge or threw a scissor with a saw.
But also a former security guard.
It was rumored that he was not having any fun with a pretty beast.
The bad language said he dropped out of school in the seventh grade, learned nothing, knew nothing.
And when the crime was dropped, he ended up at the potato shop.
But comrade, yes, comrade was forged!
The chief ordered me to sit down.
There was a little soul in me, a little pussy in my neck.
The staff reads the civil committee's assessment from the place of residence.
I come from a working-class family, I'm married, I have two children, and so on and so forth.
It's good so far, I've been thinking and I've been breathing a little better.
Then the opinion from the street party organization.
He was copying the civil committee opinion, maybe it was the same person.
But then it came!
Parents of longtime party members, refused to appear before the review committee and subsequently withdrew from the party, allegedly for health reasons.
The chief looked at me sharply.
The manager noticed and stopped reading.
The chief ordered me to continue.
It just got worse.
I was a member of the city committee of the SSM and was recruited as the party's candidate.
Regardless of the parents who came out, the party gave me confidence.
But I got married and I got married in the church, besides the National Committee.
I've failed the party's trust in the worst way.
That's why I was cut from her list of candidates.
But it wasn't enough!
I baptized both of my children, and even when my mother died, I conducted a church funeral, although she was a former member of the party.
I am expressing a negative attitude towards the leadership of the party.
When the staff member finished reading, the chief's pencil touching the tabletop interrupted the tense silence.
Everyone was staring at me, and I wished I was somewhere far away.
And I kept saying to myself, "Communists - superhumans, communists - superhumans".
Why didn't I stay at the quarry?
I could have fixed the flippers without a fucking check.
But now?
She took a career as a draughtsman before she started.
Go back to the platoon?
I don't think I can. The chief's gonna let me go to class.
"Comrade, how did you check the comrade in question here?" interrupted the tense silence of the chief by asking the staff member.
Well, according to a previous job review.
You got it?
The staff was obviously not a big deal.
He was sweating on his shoulders, staring nervously as if he were being examined.
He nodded his head and handed over some paper to the chief.
"Well", said the chief with a hint of zoom, but it was often the omen of a storm.
At first glance, he was praised, well-educated, studied industrial engineering, worked his way up the ladder as a foreman, and he met the standard on average at 120 percent.
But the essential thing is missing.
Where did you get that opinion, comrade?" he turned again to the cadet, who felt that it was somehow starting to turn against him and that he might not even be a cadet very soon.
This is the one my comrade gave me on board.
Is that enough?
"Well, when he got on board, he went to the precinct to join the squad", whispered the cadet.
And there's no need for reviews, so his was kind of a little extra, so I put it in his file.
"So when you were put into technical service, this paper was enough for you", the chief remarked.
The manager was staring nervously and he had no answer.
"It's okay, we'll talk about it later", the chief concluded, and the staffman was obviously relieved.
It's settled for now.
"What about you, comrade?" the chief turned to me again.
I'm gonna get a little sick and it's over!
My eyes were dark, my eyes were warm.
There followed a flurry of regrets and accusations, and I knew I was the most repugnant creature in the world, and I didn't deserve the slightest mercy.
That by inserting an incomplete assessment, I misled a fellow staff member, not understanding why the assessment was incomplete when I got it from a staff member at the factory.
I am also an anti-socialist element who, in the era of building real socialism, supports and even participates in the raids of religious tyranny.
That, yes, there was a lot of things I did, or maybe I'm still doing, and I prayed quietly that it would end.
I didn't care anymore.
I didn't care if I left the mechanic's seat.
I didn't care if they took my potato pie.
This is work for honest and decent people, not for the enemy of the people, as I was in the eyes of the chief's comrade.
"That's enough, Comrade Chief", the party chairman suddenly said, severely interrupting the Levite chiefs.
Here, the Comrade made a mistake, a huge mistake.
What a mistake, he did a stupid thing!
But he's already got his punishment!
Don't forget that, Comrade Chief!
What could be worse for a young man than having his side door closed for a while!
To open up to him again, he'll have to prove he's changed, he's again worthy of our trust.
The uneducated guard spoke like a book.
Where did that come from?
Is he reading or parroting phrases from classroom training and meetings?
That's why this young comrade must get a chance from us!
A chance to prove he's changed.
And who's to give it to him if not you, Comrade Chief?
It is your duty to support this young, true, somewhat erroneous comrade in his efforts to correct himself!
It's your party duty, and no one can take you away!
Actually, it's a party duty for all of us, too.
Here, a comrade must see that his side has not forgotten him.
That as a kind mother, she not only punishes but also loves.
When the chairman finished, no one even voted.
No one expected a turn of events like this.
At least I am.
"I completely agree with you, Comrade President", the chief frowned, trying to take the initiative again.
If you let me finish, you'd hear that's the conclusion I was coming to.
They all nodded their heads, but they could see that they didn't believe a word.
"So I was confirmed to be a separate referral for basic care", I cried on my way back to the office, and then I cried.
It's a good thing everyone was at lunch except Eva's engineer.
The silence was listening to my unrelated depictions of fresh experiences, and I calmed down in the meantime.
When I was done, she asked if I could have a coffee.
Without waiting for an answer, she put water on the stove and cooked the pots.
Meanwhile, she was talking about the staff practices.
Like one review, often full of praise, they give to a person, and another with some dirt in it, they send to a new employer.
But I didn't end up where I should have, but on the sidewalk at the grocery store, so the factory comrades didn't know where to send it.
What about our squad?
He just cares where he eats or drinks, and so it ended up like it ended up.
"It's the old one", she remarked meanly.
He's not gonna like it today.
You watch him anyway, he's pretty vengeful.
And the party chairman?
Basically a far worse chief, no human.
Zero from a potato maker with a lot of power.
The coffee started to boil, and soon the office filled with the smell of the coffee just poured.
I put a sugar cubit in a jar and silently mixed the hot liquor.
I hope I'm the worst out there.
I'm not getting fired now, and the next inspection is in three years.
Anyway, Comrade Chief, I won't forget this day.

The symbol of the village came alive.
The windmill's wheel is turning again after years.
It can be seen from afar because it is located on a 15-meter high mast.
People around him call it the Wind in the Willows.
For the 150-member municipality, it even became one of the elements of the municipal emblem that the municipality acquired on the occasion of the 2010 assembly of indigenous peoples.
"We asked for a sign and the windshield on the sign we wanted, of course, everyone in the area knows it", said Mayor Jiří Mašek.
The Chlum Wind Pump is a local landmark.
It is a modern-day monument, reminiscent of the time when the people of this area struggled to get clean drinking water.
In Chlum in the past centuries, it was rare.
It was not until 1910 that the Chlum representatives decided on a solution that would last until the mid-1980s.
In the village at the Chikov branch, they dug a seven-meter-deep well.
Three years later, a metal structure with a wind pump was added to the well, which pumped water into a reservoir at the highest point of the village, near the local church.
"The construction was carried out by Antonín Kunc of Frontic in Moravia at a cost of 2 400 crowns", says the sign on the ground heating of the structure of the lighthouse.
The carriage, after several repairs and windmill failures, served in 1971.
On May 7, 1973, a new chapter in the water struggle began to be written: on that day, a new water supply was opened in Chlum.
The windmill has now become a malfunctioning symbol and a local rarity.
The dominant was launched at this year's indigenous rally.
It was not until 2008 that the Chlumsk people decided to repair and restart the windmill.
They had a replica of the original bike made, reduced in diameter by half a meter.
The wheel was mounted on a platform, but that same year it had to be brought down.
The manufacturer of the replica did not choose the right material, and the wheel could not withstand the wind.
Then the Chlum dominant rested for several years, torn apart under the roof.
But from June this year, the high-altitude bike is turning again.
On the occasion of the assembly of the natives, the town had the replica of the wheel modified and reinstalled on top of the iron tower.
But the wheel only pumps the water from the well into the attack blind arm.
And over the summer, we completely disconnected it because there was little water in the well.
At least it was a blank.
"In the autumn, we will disconnect the windmill from the pump in the bag", explained Mayor Mašek.
Chlum is not the only municipality in the Czech Republic where a windmill has been made into a municipal landmark, but it is the only one of its kind in the whole of the Highlands.
A similar element in the sign is used to honor local technical monuments, for example in Chvalkovic and Green Mountain in Vyškovsk, Kuželov in Hodonínsk, Partutovic in Přerovsk or in Polica in Vsetínsk.
Nothing wrong, but I don't know Lafat, the Tripoli Goian's backing admitted.
"I remember the attack against Slavia very well, and my goal, like everyone else in my career", Goian, 34, smiled at the pre-attack press conference.
We were coached by George Hague back then, and it was unfortunate that we lost.
I hope I can score a goal for Sparta now.
Only the difference is that we won't lose this time", continued Goian.
This man, who has played 60 games for the Romanian national team, is a key support for the Greek team.
As a stopper, he will face the raids of the Spartan offensive.
A few thousand people will come, no hell, he's talking about the Greek battle of Spartan Hybes.
And he has a partial idea of what's coming Thursday night.
I know Fataie well, who played in the Romanian Astra with my brother Lucian.
I saw all their matches back then.
I know he's a very good striker, which is why he went to Sparta too, Goian said.
He didn't name another Prague club player, so the question was whether he knew David Lafat, the best shooter in the history of the Czech league and captain of Sparta.
Goian smiled and pointed a slightly calculating glance at the Czech journalist.
The helpless expression on his face said, "Why are you asking me that?"
After a moment of silence, he started.
We saw some videos and I noticed Sparta plays a lot of teamwork.
He's got really good players.
What about Lafat?
It's all right, but I don't know anybody else but Fataia.
The Spartan knows Goian very well.
"He has experience with the big clubs, he's a defender of the Asteras, he's their game organizer", noted Spartan assistant Stanislav Hejkal.
Goian has had his best years yet, but he has a very interesting football resume.
He was once the manager of Borussia Dortmund, Stuttgart, Manchester United and City, but from Steauy he went to Palermo, Italy, and also played for Glasgow Rangers.
We're expecting an aggressive and unusual style, says the coach.
Sparta is a big team, regularly playing European Cups, fighting for the Czech League.
He's my favorite in this game, but we're playing at home and we want to start the team with a good result.
Like Sparta, we will try to win, Goian said.
I'm in a room with Slovak goalkeeper Tomáš Košický, who is looking forward to a Czech opponent.
I'm sorry, too.
But I can tell you for the whole team we're gonna fight hard.
Kofola is moving from Poland to the Czech Republic, considering entering the Prague stock exchange.
Kofola should have a new headquarters in Ostrava.
Kofola S.A. was registered in Poland for trading in the company's shares on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Our primary objective is to have the group's headquarters in the Czech Republic.
The steps we have taken so far in the project are mainly legal and administrative and have no real impact on society", says Daniel Burysch, chief financial officer of Kofola Group.
'In connection with the transfer of the group's head office, the shareholders are considering placing shares on the Prague Stock Exchange.'
In order to enter the Prague Stock Exchange, the company is finalising a prospectus of the securities which it will submit to the Czech National Bank for approval in the near future.
The transfer of the holding company's head office and the related share transfers will be carried out in the form of a non-public transaction, with only existing shareholders participating.
Therefore, no shares will be offered for public subscription or to new investors in this operation.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established any other methodology for the calculation of the risk of the company's profitability.
The company has already stated in the past that a possible share offer could consist of issuing new shares or selling existing shares.
This offer could consist of an offer of shares on the stock exchanges in the Czech Republic and Poland, including the placement of shares on the Warsaw stock exchange.
A test of objectivity of Czech television in reporting on the migrant crisis.
Another small test of the objectivity and balance of the main Czech media coverage of the refugee crisis.
This time broadcasting the main news broadcast of Czech TV.
How did she survive?
Once journalism faculty teaches how the media can manipulate reality, they can start today's broadcast of Czech Events TV.
About 80% of the news was devoted to the migrant crisis.
Until the first minute when the Czech Republic reported on the unrest at the Serbian-Hungarian border and the attacks by migrants on police officers, it euphemistically called them impatient - they threw stones and attacked with metal rods), the current propaganda of migrants was already going on - judge the names of the individual reports yourself.
Criticism of NGOs - a big space for nonprofits who criticize the mistreatment of migrants.
Syrian children in the Czech School - the story of integrated Syrians in the Czech Republic.
Refugees are not only a threat, they're a chance.
Refugee travel - The CCP consistently uses the terms refugee or refugee rather than migrant.
The main concern is that the TC consistently uses only images of young children and women in its illustrations.
She said in the same broadcast that 80% of the migrants detained in the Czech Republic are men.
Summary: For the most part, propaganda that has no communist agenda.
I must say, as a former journalist, I'm ashamed of my colleagues.
Ecology in practice.
Once upon a time, when I was climbing up a penthouse, I soon ceased to be the only resident.
I've had fishermen move into the suckerboard.
Domestic fish, insects with imperfect mutation, that is, not delaying that transition from a hoover to a bug, and the young look like an adult, only tiny and growing gradually.
I hated them, and I didn't dare to kill them.
First by hand, then chemically.
The socialist drugstore provided some kind of blue crystal for their elimination.
I think it was called Cyclone B.
Or is it something else?
But it has successfully eliminated them.
I later dealt with the pharaohs in a similar way.
A box with some kind of juvenile device that the ants took to their nest and then he wouldn't let the queen generate new offspring.
But I turned it around.
As time went on, insects became my object of admiration, and I became increasingly inclined to believe that they have the same right to life as humans.
And I've learned from life that interfering with ecosystems doesn't lead to success, and one pest can replace another.
Truth be told, I wouldn't mind making my karma worse by killing them.
In our new home, my partner and I agreed that if the fish aren't gonna get our throats, they should be able to eat some of the shells of fallen skin, some of the invisible algae, and all that.
Their quiet existence was disrupted by a spider over time.
He was a common type of penitent who lived on the ceiling for a long time.
We thought it lived on occasional mosquitoes and mosquitoes, which only made us more comfortable.
Since he's lived with us for several years, we found that he's mainly fed on fish and that he's probably kept their numbers at a captive number.
By making regular, confidential contact with each need, we found out that it was a female.
We have witnessed romantic conversations with a partner about a third the size of a spider's web to avoid being eaten before it reaches its desired coupling.
It took about three days for them to move and not even respond to our checks.
Under the toilet bowl where the love games were taking place, we later found the remains of a dried male next to the female.
After that, the spider didn't move for weeks.
When we thought she was done, we were surprised by the number of tiny spiders hanging around her.
They soon disappeared.
They were eaten by their mother, and they were taken away.
Even the female disappeared after a week.
Whether she left or died, we don't know, but after a month, two, she showed up on the ceiling again.
True, a little smaller, probably the daughter of that toilet-dweller.
For some time, she watched our behavior carefully from the ceiling and, by moving under the toilet, evaluated our non-attack as friendship.
The number of the slightly overcrowded fish has decreased, and the spider has quietly looked into its normal activities to secure food.
Our ecosystem hasn't changed in a year.
In the meantime, our daughter had reached the age when wearing a nightgown was already a disgrace.
We've tolerated it so far, but the eternal spilling of its contents has fed us.
We've been pushing her harder and harder to use the bathroom.
But her daughter found an excuse to keep her habit alive in that spider she could see very well when she was wiping.
Our talk about spiders seeing, having happiness in the house, didn't take off.
She was crying and screaming and she was pushing her nightgown.
There was no rest.
There came a time when the spider had to order, in the interest of her daughter's developmental shift.
It's up to me.
He was caught in a glass and led through the balcony to the garden.
I said goodbye to him like a friend, but I still felt awful after so long a relationship, like I was throwing a relative out.
We assumed that the fishes would start to appear more often and start to multiply by a geometric sequence.
It's a wonder, a week, two, we didn't see any of them.
I started speculating on the cause.
I wondered if the ant-shaped spider had somehow grown them, that the toilet environment was not as favorable to their existence as we thought.
But then the first mid-sized pieces came along, and they were already swarming again.
I had to come up with another theory about the cause of their disappearance, and I figured that their attachment to the spider must have had a reason that if they didn't see it, they were hiding somewhere else and they were in danger from anywhere.
Or maybe they had some kind of telepathic connection to their predator and his quick disappearance triggered some kind of panic response.
I'm not making any illusions about their vision.
They showed some slight shyness, but they would respond to shaking hands or quick movements, not so much.
My daughter goes to the bathroom regularly.
I think she forgot her nightgown.
All we have to do is draw another spider.
I'm already broadcasting my wishes, and I hope they haven't been unsealed on me after the execution.
Otherwise we'd have to use that Cyclone B.
Ten of Albert Einstein's sayings that enriched the world.
The words of a brilliant scientist of the last century will likely never cease to fascinate mankind.
He was able to dive so deeply into everything that the result was always a stunning discovery.
Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was one of the most important scientists of all time.
He has come to the attention of mankind above all with his special and general theory of relativity, which so far is the best description of the universe in its gigantic proportions.
Nor can his clarification of the photo effect or the idea of quantifying the electromagnetic field be ignored.
There is no doubt that the very description and system of knowledge of popular relativity theory is so complex for many that they prefer easy lines for closer acquaintance.
But it's not easy.
But it wouldn't be Albert Einstein if he didn't come up with a brilliantly simplified explanation for this: A clock near your loved one seems like a minute; a minute in a hot stove seems like an hour - and that's relativity.
I took the liberty of choosing among his plethora of famous quotes these ten that literally captivated me.
Intelligent people try to solve problems, geniuses try not to.
Only two things are infinite.
The universe and human stupidity.
I'm not so sure about the first one.
No amount of trial can ever prove me right.
But the only one who can prove me wrong is me.
But it's a sad time when it's easier to break an atom than to destroy prejudice.
If the mess on the table is a reflection of the mess in the mind, what does an empty table reflect?
I don't know what he'll fight in World War III, but in World War IV, it'll be sticks and stones.
There are thousands of ways to kill time, but none to resurrect it.
Knowing little is dangerous and knowing much is dangerous.
If I had an hour to deal with a problem that my life depends on, I'd spend 40 minutes studying it, 15 minutes analyzing it, and 5 minutes solving it.
The hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax.
And finally, I can't help but mention Einstein's formula for success: If we take A as success, the formula is: A=X+Y+Z, where X is work, Y is rest, and Z is to keep your mouth shut.
New and modern.
The hospitals in Zlín County are waiting for a $1.5 billion change.
"It is a success considering that all four of them have been holding on to black numbers all year", said Stanislav Mišák, a Hajtman.
The total profit of the regional facilities is about 32 million crowns at this time.
The main part of this is higher premiums than insurance companies, which are equally favourable for this year.
And this fact shows that after years of poor health, hospitals can finally afford to invest more.
In Kroměříž, Vsetín, Uherská hradišta and Zlín, the project will cost nearly 1.5 billion crowns.
The long period of buying mainly machines is over.
Now we have to start building new buildings, because without them, the best healthcare can't be done, the plans were justified by the regional deputy for health Lubomír Nečas.
He's looking forward to changes in all hospitals.
The builders are coming to the hospitals next year.
In the whole of the country, they are now selecting suppliers for a new indoor pavilion for almost 300 million crowns.
They have a planned dialysis facility in Chromwery.
The Hungarian Palace is planning to build a new interior for the Central Pavilion, which will open this year, at a cost of about 200 million.
And the long-delayed construction of a new central hospital and a new hospital, the Zlín Bat's Hospital, will require three-quarters of a billion dollars.
In all cases, these are the most fundamental and often the most important changes in recent years.
"This is an extremely important step for the whole region, patients and doctors alike", said Věra Prousková, director of the hospital, for example, in the construction of the Vsetina Internal Facility.
The five-story building there is expected to be completed in about two years and will offer comfortable facilities for the intern and neurology, dialysis, a new ambulance, a bed and an intensive care unit.
More comfort for the patients.
Changes that are significantly recognised by patients will affect all regions.
The new buildings will replace those where, for example, many patients are in one room, there is only one toilet on the floor, beds are unstable, windows are unlocked, and medical personnel are not adequately equipped.
"For example, our hospital was built 35 years ago and is now on the brink of its lifespan", noted Pavel Calabek, director of the Zlín hospital.
In a few years, it will be replaced by a modern seven-story building connected to the emergency room.
Doctors and patients will have all the emergency departments in one place, plus new premises.
The same model is already half-finished at the Hungarian Castle.
Central income is already up and he's getting interned in three years.
"We will pay for the building with a loan and partly with our own funds", explained the director Petr Sládek.
This is the only hospital in the county that can afford its own funding.
The profit is still at its highest and it hasn't reached a loss for two years, when the Zlin hospital, for example, suffered a loss of almost $200 million.
"We have good contracts with insurance companies, excellent performance, increased revenue and managed costs effectively throughout the hospital", said Vlastimil Vajdak, who is in charge of the economy.
The patients at the hospital outside of the city are also looking forward to improvements.
In ten to 15 years, up to half a billion crowns will be spent on repairs, new equipment and reconstruction.
This year, the repair of the detention station will be completed, then the construction of the dialysis will begin, or the construction of a new magnetic resonance building.

No one explained to me how to keep the refugees in the country if they don't want to live in the Czech Republic.
Interior Minister Milan Chovanec (CSSD) has complained after talks with his European colleagues that other states are pressing the Czech Republic to adopt quotas for the redistribution of refugees, but they are refusing any discussion.
He also points out that no one has yet explained to him how to keep the refugees in the Czech Republic if they do not want to live with us.
"We didn't get an answer, so we wanted quotas to be released from the final text", Chovanec told reporters.
Can you describe more specifically the position you took at the meeting of the EU's Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs?
We disagree with mandatory quotas as a system that simply cannot work.
We can't talk about migrants like bags of salt or flour.
They're living beings who have visions, they're going somewhere, they've got relatives.
We wanted to hear from our colleagues how we could keep migrants in the Member States if they were redistributed.
We can't imagine that.
We did not receive an answer, so we wanted quotas to be released from the final text.
With the other conclusions - functional hotspots, that is, registration places, border security, camps outside Europe, trust fund for African countries and other things, we have no problem with that.
We've been talking about this for a year and we're saying this is the way.
But to say that quotas solve everything?
We just settled for 40,000 recently, now it's 120,000.
When will it be 500 grand?
And how do we keep these people in the territory?
Ninety-eight percent of all people who pass through us want to go to Germany.
Almost no one wants to come to us, we just don't know how to keep them here.
We have the ambition to have other foreigners, Ukrainians, Vietnamese and others who take the Czech Republic as their destination country, who are granted asylum here, but the interest of people from this wave of migration, that is, from Syria and other countries, is very close to zero.
You mentioned that the refugees don't want to come to us, but we've already committed to 150 people.
Couldn't we have more of them on this road?
We pledged to take 1,500 people, but on one condition.
We said functional hotspots, border security, military operations.
Even with the 1,500, the point is that there will be 1,100 people to handle the asylum procedure.
They're coming to our detention facility and we're gonna treat them the same way we treated the ones we captured.
It's a big question, and we're going to debate with Europe whether we can hold people who are registered in Italy and Greece, or possibly Hungary.
Because Europe is behaving like if they have a license, they can't be stopped.
That means they come to our territory with a registration, and if there's a deal that hasn't been reached yet, it could happen that we don't keep the 1,100 in the Czech Republic, and they'll leave after they get back to Germany.
If we can hold them during the asylum proceedings, we will proceed with the asylum procedure.
If they are citizens of Syria, Eritrea, almost 98 percent of them, according to European statistics, are granted international protection.
Then they get the documents that will allow them to travel around Europe.
And I think these people will end up in the target countries again.
Then there's 400 people who'll move in.
This is the second project that is currently underway, and we have only made progress there by discussing with the churches the possibilities of helping them get jobs, housing, and so on.
But it's a very long run.
You said that at the ministerial meeting with us, other states were unwilling to discuss.
But is it not that the Czech Republic is simply rejecting quotas but is not offering any solidarity measure to unblock this debate?
And what exactly do you think is the solidarity step?
If the Federal Republic of Germany issues an invitation that all Syrian migrants can come to them, the news spreads in the hours across all the camps in Europe, but also in Turkey, Jordan.
It's triggering another wave of migration that's headed for Germany because they just don't want us.
We think the way is to protect the external borders -- to simply discourage the migration waves, to help the needy, and to separate economic migrants.
Clearly show them they don't stand a chance.
Only last year, 50,000 Kosovans came to Germany.
From a safe Kosovo, where we pay for all the saturation of this state, including the police, the courts, the prosecutor's office.
If we could separate them and not accept them or accept them only according to the needs of the economy, then 50 percent of what the social systems spend on them today in vain could go to refugees.
On the first day of the German check, the number of detainees in the Czech Republic jumped.
It's eighty now, it was twelve the first day.
Where is it going to go to get border controls even stricter?
We were afraid of seizing hundreds of people.
These are the numbers we can handle.
We still have several hundred vacant seats in the stone detention facilities.
Of course, all the people we hold will be returned to Austria in seven days.
We do it by default.
The Austrians are the only ones who take these people away from us, with Hungary it's complicated and the Greeks - that's a completely useless story.
So where's the break point?
Does it have to be a thousand a day?
I think it's gonna take a couple hundred a day.
Two hundred, three hundred people a day for two, three days in a row, depleting our capacity enough to set up crisis plans.
Then I agreed with the Prime Minister to call an emergency government immediately.
He's very interested in the whole thing, we're on the phone several times a day.
If that happens, the government can sit down de facto immediately and decide by a resolution to strengthen the police force, the military, the customs, and the prison service.
The final option is the state of emergency that Hungary has now declared in some places?
I don't think it can get that far.
We are a national state within Europe, we have only the Schengen border at the airport.
I don't know what would have to happen to make this happen on the territory of the Czech Republic, I don't want to spread alarming information.
All the information we have, whether from Moldova, Serbia, Hungary, suggests that Hungarians will try to divert the migration flow to Croatia and Slovenia, which would then mean a direct route to Austria.
The Czech Republic would be affected very marginally, almost at all.
Slavia paid off a lot of debt at the last minute.
It's trying to prevent a bankruptcy filing.
Football Slavia paid off the debt.
The football players got their money.
Football Slavia appeared in court for the first time on Tuesday for insolvency proceedings.
Almost three months after it was proposed by Online Services of Pacific Samoa for about 20 million crowns.
Slavia's lawyer, Zuzana Mladic, tried to convince Judge Michael Wenzla within hours that she should not declare bankruptcy against Slavia.
And I have to say, she had an argument.
One of the main arguments was that last week, the new owner of Slavonia became the large Chinese industrial and investment group CEFC and also the Czech billionaire Jiří Šimána.
Apparently, the new owners brought money to the club at the last minute.
This is also proven by Slavia's statement before Tuesday's court hearing - a top club on Monday, just the day before the court hearing, sent tens of millions of crowns in debt.
"Everything was paid between September 11 and September 15", said Slavia Mladekova, a lawyer.
Who did Slavia pay for?
Current and former players and business partners.
Specifically, the Slovak former representative Milan Ivanov or the Czech backer Maria Ličkov.
Slavia also paid a fee to Agent Alexander Losenick.
On Friday, the club paid the debts of the Prague 10 district.
In this way, only claims which Slavonia disputes remain de facto part of the insolvency proceedings.
Either the club claims that the commitments were not made at all or they are being challenged in court.
However, we are prepared to pay the sum in the event of a loss of these disputes.
"We have the necessary funds in our bank account, which we can prove by a statement from the account", said Judge Advocate Mládková.
"Everything that was due is paid", Mladáková said, adding that only unpaid or contradicted obligations are not paid.
It's also certain that the judge will not rule in the coming days and the trial will continue.
She gave Slavia three weeks to send detailed evidence that she actually paid the debt.
The evidence will be evaluated.
A decision can therefore be expected as early as November.
The judge ordered the proceedings to resume on November 3.
However, the decision will not be taken at this meeting, but in writing.
Medals for Finland and Austria.
FastMig X is the representative of the latest generation of inverter welding sources.
The combination of state-of-the-art technology, hardware and software integrated into the modular design provides benefits and a rapid return on investment in the form of high quality, productivity and reliability.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
And that's all kinds of things, from welding structural steel to welding special alloys, as well as welding of raw materials to welding of thin plates, from applications in workshops to welding in shipyards.
The incredible number of welding curves, the simple setup and the scalability of the welding source allow for rapid response to changing requirements, leading to reduced strains, the need to change the source and more productive welding.
FastMig X enables welding with state-of-the-art welding processes developed by Kemppi, which ensure higher productivity and welding quality.
Time is lost and no material is wasted or faulty welds are repaired.
Flexibility is ensured, there are fewer strains, more welding and higher profits.
It's this year's news that premiered in Nitra, where it also won a gold medal.
We value these honours very much, as they confirm the uniqueness of the product.
The world's leading manufacturers can boast of similar systems, but due to differences in software and parameter control, FastMig X is among the world's top.
Delivery times of around three weeks are certainly pleasant for the interested parties.
We have already established the first contacts in the Czech Republic, which will certainly be extended after the Brno fair.
We have been regular customers for over 20 years and almost always our business results are better than before, says Miroslav Streichsbier, head of sales at Kemppi in Plzeň.
FastMig X is a modular system, so the final assembly is always configured according to customer requirements.
The white one could be built to keep it from falling.
But it would cost half a billion more, says an expert at the company that designed the tunnel.
The white was even safer to cut, says the expert.
The Blanka tunnel complex was built to prevent two landslides in Stromovca, Prague, according to the production director of Satra, the main designer of the tunnel, Alexandr Butovič.
He said that on Wednesday afternoon during a press briefing on the tunnel.
But he thinks it's about half a billion crowns more expensive.
It opens to drivers on Saturday afternoon.
It's always a trade-off between price and security.
"The tunnel was cleared safer, but the costs are increasing exponentially", Butovic said.
The conditions at Tromovca were the same, he said, all the while, yet the land fell just steps from where it began to erupt with a safer and more cautious method.
"If the measures were applied 500 meters earlier, the tunnel would be half a billion dollars more expensive", Butović said.
The Blanka Tunnel collapsed three times during construction.
Twice, in 2008, a crater was created in Stromovce, in 2010 the land fell to the Ministry of Culture in Prague 6.
According to Metrostov's CEO, Jiri Bělohlov, the tunnel is unnecessarily expensive, the weekly Euro reported.
The original plan was to cost 17 billion crowns.
And if you add that to the VAT that doubled during the construction, you've got 21 out of 17 billion.
Adding up technology, land acquisitions and engineering, asset recovery and the like, it's 29 billion, which is not that far from the 37 billion, said Whitehead.
Someone ordered it and paid for it.

FedEx's combined profits, reduction of the fiscal outlook for 2016
FedEx reported unsatisfactory results for the last quarter and a huge reduction in its year-round profit forecast due to low demand for freight and higher costs for the land division.
The company also said it planned to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers over the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal holiday workers.
The company's stock fell about 2.5 percent in the pre-market 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx says it expects revenue of between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is a 20 cents drop from its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The downward trend comes despite an average rate increase of 4.9%, which will be reflected in January 4, and higher rates for the land transport of heavy or large parcels starting in November.
The company stated that it still expects a profit increase from the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, Chairman of the Board and CEO, said that the company "performed solidly despite weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in the processing industry and global trade".
The holiday hire plans were announced a day after rival UPS announced it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, which is about the same as last year's hiring.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from last year.
Earnings per share were $2.42, down from $2.44 per share, as predicted by 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
The market has grown 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit by a decline in international shipping priorities in recent years, which has caused revenues in its Express unit to stagnate.
But the online shopping boom has boosted the results of the FedEx ground unit.
Land revenues increased 29 percent in the last quarter, but operating profit was essentially the same due to higher prices for larger packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded higher income due to higher basic rates, while profit decreased in the cost trade due to higher labour prices.
In the pre-market trading period, about an hour before the opening, FedEx's shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They finished Tuesday down 11 percent year-on-year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve lawmakers will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot-long Honduran mahogany table deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate after nearly a decade.
Overlaid on one end of the central bank's ornament, the two-story meeting room will be a mural painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests above all else.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize American employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed officials have recognized that there is an unwritten third term: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-Factor too close to the predictable decision to be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to launch a move away from an unprecedented stimulus of near-zero short-term interest rates on the spot since late 2008.
While most data show solid economic growth, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed into adding to the volatility by raising its federal funds rate of reference by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing to watch first", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think they were just looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market already giving them enough reason to wait", she said.
There's no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is a cause of nervousness in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently interviewed by Blomberg predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay the issue, with a key indicator of only about a 30% chance of a raise.
That would indicate a stock market decline if the Fed raises rates only if politicians hit a slump with the promise that further increases are in sight.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The meeting was started with the expectation that Fed politicians would slow rates down this week, says John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates now", he says.
If Fed politicians do, "they should go to extremes in their programming statements and hold the financial markets in their hands to keep them from panicking".
Other experts have argued that raising rates would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about how the Fed would proceed.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
Yellen said she expects rates to rise this year through the spring and early summer despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the labour market experienced solid growth this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the previous month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed considers full employment.
The payroll gains showed signs of improvement.
And while inflation continues to fall below the central bank's annual target of 2 percent, Fed politicians say the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher rates, given the tightness of the labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shift late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% below its record in May, as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market has been a bit down this month and the Dow is now losing just about 10% of its May peak.
The uncertain market situation gives the Fed's political actors a complex calculation to take into account the rate increase.
"In the absence of what happened in the financial markets, and reports of weakness in the Chinese economy over the past few weeks, there would be a tightening of this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he predicts they'll wait at least a month to gain better control of the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about the impact this will have on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on for the latest developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a key concern of the Fed, so it should not technically be included in its decision-making.
But the Fed has actually become the monetary authority of the entire world.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Just a hint by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "squeeze" their monetary expansion into the marketplace triggered worldwide crunch.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interconnected, Fed officials can be expected to monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central bankers and experts to better understand the state of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, global wealth management strategy director at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of exaggerated movements in financial markets that seem to be inconsistent with economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy-making body who pushed for higher rates, cited the 1998-99 decision as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 percentage points over three sessions "despite limited identifiable impacts on growth in the U.S"., Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize concerns about financial stability during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam Posen S., a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee.
The latest outbreak is not even close to this level, he said.
"You certainly don't want to be in a situation of fear of rising rates because markets have become angry", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act has a second mandate and it doesn't mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be on top.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown
The market/depository was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai marketplace that also sells to the public.
Yes, it's a Chinatown, not a Thai one.
The market/ warehouse is the only contact point offering a staggering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and kitchenware, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part available if you need some engine oil.
The traffic is massive and it will take you over an hour to cross all the alleys.
If you're hungry from all this shopping, go get a meal at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The internal trading post (good, cheap) is close to the registers and has various pick-up points.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - Thai?
You'll probably find it in LAX-C.
The items are affordable and many items are sold in bulk.
The fresh meat includes special Asian and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat distribution is huge, like fish -- the staff behind the counter washes you and feeds you, even fries you if you want to,
A good part of the store is left to a massive freezer section where you'll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork guts, fish balls, regional sausages, free-selling semi-finished goods, and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, as well as single families and individuals.
The wide alleys lead to shopping carts and elevators.
Fresh monthong durian next to the box office.
Location: The store is in the industrial area of Los Angeles, surrounded by the Chinatown suburbs and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
While the store can be occupied, parking is usually not hard to find.
Speed on the highways will stay the same.
Acceleration to 150 km/h. The House has rejected it.
The maximum speed shall not be increased to 150 km/h under favourable conditions on selected sections of motorways.
That's what the House decided on Tuesday when it passed a Senate amendment that rejected the speed increase.
The new land-based communications bill is now headed to the president.
President Miloš Zeman said in late April that he would veto a law allowing 100 kilometres of speed.
The Czech Republic's transport minister Dan Đok (for ANO) also opposed the increase, saying that the Czech motorway network has not yet been built at such a speed.
The Senate passed the bill on Tuesday before the House.
The approved amendment will now allow, in line with the original government proposal, an increase in speed from 90 to 110 km/h on selected first-class roads, in particular four-lane roads.
The House first extended this option to highways that could be used for speeds up to 150 km/h in selected sections, but the Senate rejected it.
The Members have now accepted his proposal.
The senators, with the approval of the transport minister, also removed the authorization of the traffic police to have the last word on local communications that the municipalities are taking care of.
The Senate version, approved by the House, also includes the possibility of laying sewerage, water or public lighting cables along the road surface.
It would save the towns money to buy land.
The municipality should also not be obliged to take care of road vegetation along local roads, regardless of the owner of the land concerned.
The new scheme is also intended to improve road safety and to make it easier for municipalities to deal with unreported towed vehicles.
New municipalities could sell withdrawn vehicles which their owners do not register within six months of the withdrawal notification.
The municipalities will be able to exclude transit freight through their territory on second and third class roads, even at the risk of fines for freight forwarding companies.
The new legislation also eliminates the possibility of replacing the existing electronic road signs with paper ones, which will continue to be used after 1 January next year.
The government says it'll save money for the electronic system.
The oral expressor is going to court.
He's facing 10 years for overpriced public welcome.
The case concerns the allegedly overrated Citizens' Welcome project.
The police also wanted to prosecute the MP Zuzana Kail (ČSSD) in this case, but the Chamber of Deputies did not give her.
The legal qualifications of the case put them both at risk of up to 10 years in prison.
The main draw is scheduled for October 2nd.
According to the prosecutor, Mandik and Macic caused at least one million crowns of damage, according to the indictment.
The plaintiff is based on expert judgment.
According to the applicant, former members of the city council, in the name of their office, unlawfully allowed the company that organised the welcome to the citizens to obtain a property benefit.
The indictment alleges that the then head of the municipal services, education and culture department ordered the petitioner to contact five related companies in the tendering procedure.
When another company entered the contest offering the lowest price, the city council cancelled the contest.
The contract was then entrusted to the city manager and only Darothore was entered into the competition, which was then awarded by the city council.
The city paid at least a million extra.
Both charges, aimed at securing Darothore's public procurement for the long-term and coordinated hosting of the Citizens' Welcome event in Ust nad Lab, at least violated the requirement of a proper housekeeper's care procedure, the prosecutor writes.
At the same time, they were aware that, following the award of the contract, Darothore would charge the Office over Lab for the implementation of the Citizens' Welcome event, a price which would be disproportionately higher than the real value of the services actually provided.
In three years, the company has collected more than five million crowns for the project, according to the file.
The city paid only one part, about 1.7 million crowns, then withdrew.
The amount paid was, according to the expert opinion, at least 1 million crowns overpriced.
The mansion has denied any violation of the law before.
I didn't commit a crime. I'm innocent.
I don't understand this elaborate case, the former mayor said earlier, saying that the city under his leadership was merely building on a similar project from years ago.
Between 2008 and 2010, the event was organised by Roxy II.
"It was on the same terms, for the same money", added Mandik.
The forensics initially wanted to charge Kail, a member of the city council.
The House of Representatives has not filed a lawsuit against her.
So, the forensics have dropped the case, but they expect Kail to be indicted after her term ends.
The welcome of the citizens was a social event that took place several times a year.
Her mother was given a gift check for 5,000 crowns to buy baby supplies and small gifts.
Hungarian police reportedly let a dog go.
Then they had the press erase the record.
Hungarian police reportedly briefly detained an AP cameraman at the border with Serbia and forced him to delete a recording of a police dog allegedly knocking down a refugee.
But the Hungarian government has questioned this accusation.
The alleged incident happened on Saturday night when AP cameraman Luca Muzi filmed migrants crossing the border with Serbia through a cornfield near the Hungarian town of Röszke.
The police came in on the refugees and one of them let a certain Syrian dog attack with a basket on his back.
The dog of a man who shouted, "Please, please, I'm a refugee", roared, Muzi claims.
One of the cops noticed Muzi was filming everything and wouldn't let him go.
The reporter was no longer allowed to call his superiors or colleagues on the spot.
The police took Muzi to a dark spot near the refugee registration center and asked him to show them what he had on tape.
Then they ordered him to erase the record.
This is how Muzi lost the result of two days of work in Serbia and Hungary.
He says he felt in danger because there were dogs around.
The AP has sent a letter of protest to Hungarian government spokesman Zoltán Kovács.
She called the police's behavior unacceptable, saying that journalists should be able to cover events without risking physical violence and without fear that the government will destroy legally acquired material.
Kovács, referring to the police report, questioned Muzi's account of the events.
He said the cops just wanted a reporter to show them if they were on some footage, which they say they're entitled to.
When they found out they weren't there, they didn't force anything to rub it.
"Dogs can bark - they are trained to scare off and scare a little, but they don't attack with certainty", says Kovács.
The unpredictable Champions League.
A win at City will kick us, Juventus believes.
"It's a disappointment, I don't think we deserved to lose", turned his head Manuel Pellegrini, home City coach.
We had better chances and we played better than Juventus.
It was a classic Champions League game.
Neither team created a lot of opportunities, but we had the ball on the balls longer than we did.
"The reason for the defeat was not tactical, Juventus simply scored two beautiful goals", Pellegrini said, whose team collected 636 minutes in the competition.
Last season's finalist Juventus was in the opposite direction - after the first three rounds of the Italian league, he only has a point as defender and a score of 2:4 is only 16th in the table.
That's why the turn at Etihad Stadium was a big surprise.
"This win will help us mentally, it will kick us", believes coach Massimiliano Allegri, who had to deal with the loss of three backers - Pirla, Tevez and Vidal - before the new year.
They were represented in Manchester by Pogba, Manjukich and Morat.
"It is so, this victory is so important, perhaps it will feed us to the wave of victory", hopes Morata.
Because when we're on it, we're among the best teams in Europe.
We were better in the second half, especially in the offensive phase.
This is the result my players deserve.
"We could have been on the opposite end of the spectrum at 0:2 before our goal, but Gianluigi supported us", said coach Allegri, who is the goalkeeper for Buffon.
"We burned a few good chances", said City defender Yaya Touré.
We need to get some experience from the Champions League and try to get a better result next time.
Goodbye, Angelo, goodbye to old Germany II.
Before we go on with the immigrant issue, we should realize that the whole media crackdown is being driven by professionals.
According to the media, and from above.
So let's stop for a second.
Today, newspapers and the media are full of little children carrying their parents on their dusty exodus journeys.
And that automatically creates a sense of guilt and compassion in the person - the European person.
Well, they're not just desperate little children coming here, but notice from the pictures of boats landing on the Greek islands that little children are not so visible on them!
Well, somehow, recently, we've lost the television footage of ships heading for Lampedusa, escaping from the French border near Menton, whose beautiful promenades lay with thousands of young men.
Mostly young black people.
And also missing pictures of Callais where these guys are eating and black men waiting to get through the tunnel under La Manche.
I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
Even the images of the early Christian church of Eritreans did not impress Europeans in any way.
Too much of this was a fake.
So when it comes to refugee quotas, it's kind of a mystery that they're not just unhappy Syrian children, but also well-adjusted -- for the elderly -- fashion-dressed -- young men.
Their muscles look like they just came out of a fitness center.
I'm just having one personal experience.
This summer, in the Turkish-Muslim part of Cyprus, we were lying on a private hotel beach.
Despite being private, a large group of cars suddenly arrived at the beach.
But no ham.
And young black men came out of them.
About 30 men and five women.
Between 15 and 30 years old.
They're on the beach, all dressed in branded clothes and shoes, with, like, smartphones in their hands.
They didn't care that it was a private beach, and the staff -- Turks, Muslims! -- were obviously afraid of it.
They've occupied every bunk.
Whoever wasn't on it and was just at sea was unlucky.
They were dressed like in an American rap movie.
On the head, a nail-hatted hat, white and colored adidas on the legs.
Then they took a local beach bar and started to wave.
They sat around tables, crowded themselves with the white and hungry guests sitting next to the bar -- Muslims and Europeans, without asking.
Mothers and children fled from the dining terrace to a quiet place.
Black people who came in drinking beer from a third - like in the US series?! - throwing empty bottles around the beach.
They kept yelling at each other.
It wasn't in English, though.
Then they drank wine, also straight from the bottle.
They plunged into the hotel pool - in branded swimsuits, especially the young ladies - screaming and screaming in the water, the mothers with their children and the pensioners fled in terror, and within half an hour there was not a single black guest on the beach or in the pool.
They're all gone.
Regardless of whether someone was a Christian or a Muslim.
The hotel staff were afraid to talk about them.
The waiter said to me in a low voice that evening, "Did you see the gold they were wearing?"
"Yeah", I said.
"Well, they certainly didn't have it from work", said the waiter.
I remembered, "I know, everyone had massive gold chains around their necks.
And one had a massive gold cross about 20 centimeters around his neck.
And women were like gold.
"Are these drug dealers?" I asked.
"You saw them drinking", replied the waiter.
They don't smoke or use drugs.
They're smuggling something completely different.
So I knew what they were smuggling.
But in June 2105 it wasn't so important to me.
I had no idea what was coming next.
But the secret service and top politicians should have known first.
I don't think they know.
About 1.5 million immigrants arrived in Europe at that time.
And they go and they go and they go.
Today it has become clear that the main problem of the European Union is that totalitarian-political-correct politicians, like intellectuals and their lobbying and economically important groups, have the greatest power in Europe.
Germany and its politicians - now the publicly recognized major power in Europe - lie, lie and lie - but not only them, but also the top EU and television, including ours.
For example, recent television images of the enthusiastic reception of refugees in Germany are at the level of Moscow TV images from August 1968.
Sure, there were a few sunbathers at the station, but mostly - the ancient Germans - Muslims welcomed their privateers.
For weeks they were babbling on the news on Czech TV, saying that according to some research, almost all Germans are for the arrival of immigrants.
But whoever's been to Germany for a few days knows it's a lie like a tower.
Which confirms the information.
For example, the famous public opinion poll organised by ARD - Czech Association of Public Television Companies of the Federal Republic of Germany.
According to ARD, just a week ago, more than 50% of Germans wanted to take in even more refugees.
That's what our TVs were reporting.
However, they kept a secret of what broke out the next day in Germany: that a polling of the article showed that 94.5 percent of Germans no longer want immigrants - 67,000 people took part in the survey.
It is true that Chancellor Merkel publicly declared in November 2010, five years ago: "Our attempt to create a multi-cultural society has failed utterly".
She then said: "Germany is giving up its fight for a multicultural society".
"All attempts to live together like this have failed".
In a country where there are four million Muslims, she said, there was no strategy that allowed people from different cultural backgrounds to live side by side without integrating.
But that's not reality.
The multicultural approach, where we say we're just happy living next door, that's a failure.
He failed.
But even Merkel seems to have no power to go against the powerful Germany and Europe and above all against political correctness.
It shows an escalation of events.
The conflict is escalating rapidly.
The European Parliament's President, Mr Schulz, the SPD MP, the only one in the European Parliament who is not even a graduate - yes, that is the one Berlusconi said in the EU Parliament that he could play the supervisor of a concentration camp from one minute to the next - has been a demonstration, as he has done many times.
It seems, especially under the impression of the latest statements by German politicians, that Germany has crossed the Rubik's Cube.
Note that, except for some, most European politicians, who do not support these statements, citizens of countries that were victims of Nazism are horrified.
What happened to the Germans?
With those rich, successful, solid Germans?
Who have spent years trying, at least outwardly, to deal with their terrible past as an aggressor and murderer of millions?
Are they right to say that the devil of aggression, superiority and violence is seeded into the soul of Germany?
Was Chancellor Otto von Bismarck right when he tried to stop the Germans from trying to take control of the whole of central Europe?
When did he say a big German idea would destroy Germany?
I guess he did.
When it was dismantled, preparations for World War I began.
The idea of Greater Germany, which led Germany and Europe into two wars that cost millions of lives, probably came back in a different form.
After the Marxists' attempt to take over the state, for example with the Rote Armee Fraktion, and the failure of the GDR, a new German ideology began to develop in Germany, based on ecology, for example, which was, by the way, one of the main ideological teachings of Nazism.
I'd say sunny.
The German elites have long defended the birth of German nationalism, leaving all those anti-atom fighters in peace, eagerly seeking paradise for all, quietly supporting the old imperial and Nazi motto Our forest must live.
To satisfy the restless young people around the world who want to do something different and better, they have fully joined the warming world, stopped nuclear power plants, etc.
And they forgot that there was also a strong anti-Semitic, so-called pro-Palestinian, and anti-Slovenian movement in this stream that considered all Slavs a difficult frontier, since the days of Karl Marx, who, from his Jewish parents, was primarily a German nationalist.
And also, as the latest statements by Schulz and German ministers who openly threaten disobedient eastern states show, the idea of a leading Germany.
Which must be obeyed without a contract.
Otherwise, you're in trouble!
And if we add to that that immigrants are a very influential group of voters, we have what we have.
And as always, there is capital behind it, especially the German one, which is convenient and which derives from the fact that Germany actually controls most of the countries of Europe through the banks and the Union.
The pseudo-fairy tale of the sunflowers first led the Germans into the swamps of ecology and multiculturalism and today has brought home to them, and will bring millions of Muslims.
Which, the siren's screaming voices, soon hit the wall of reality that Merkel doesn't want to see, and they start to storm.
Germany can only threaten its neighbors with force again, again it can drive some of its population - but apparently a smaller part - ideologically insane, but in the end, as always, reality will drive it away.
Will Germany burn again?
The Muslim hostels are on fire.
What will the German government do when the public protests against the incoming Islamists break out?
To whom will Muslims who have lived in Germany for a long time come to the aid, but certainly not assimilated to adopt local customs and laws?
What will the German government do when naturalized Muslims, incoming Islamists and Germans are forced into their country, fearing to Islamise?
What will it do to the Germans, and to Germany in general, when people rise up and protest loudly and publicly against the new Euro-sub-human Muslim?
Germany has just changed.
The conflict that has been stirred up in Europe by the support of a sun-drenched ideology, an ideology of elitism and, in principle, totalitarianism, and its insatiable banks, is growing.
And because of the unyielding treatment of the disobedient democratic Germans and all the inferior and disobedient Eastern neighbors, it cannot go well.
Finished tomorrow.
The best way to get rid of the sneaky salesmen is to scare them to death.
You just knock and a robust bat will hit you in a way that the weaker nature may not be able to stop right now.
A lively head will make you feel good and drive the weary away, accompanied by a hard-working salesman and a lively statue.
It's a shame you can't actually get a talking bat.
We could use a lot of scum and shit.
The juice is pink (Oxalis corniculata).
A small weed that tolerates dry environments.
So it's in the countryside near my place of residence.
On September 16, 2015, I photographed a beautiful plant that is a plant of expansive weeds, but it does make a nice impression when it comes to flowering.
It's in the outdoor tile.
She's uncharted, she's doing well in our garden.
She likes a drier environment, she's adaptable, modest, and easygoing.
Although she creates leaves with a chaotic composition, it's worth watching and still taking pictures.
Under the microscope, there is only the beauty of detail - yellow flowers and green leaves, also accompanied by purple.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatric Society promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric society SPRS has come up with a shocking way to try to convey to women the importance of a good breastfeeding diet by using images of babies sipping from their breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide infants with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the moderate energy requirements, pregnant women and newlyweds are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that increased calorie intake is not the only dietary measure that mothers should follow.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually influenced the genetics of their children and protected them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diets have also been shown to negatively affect the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, even though Nine's is trying to take over the Today Show.
The case of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberry over the cost of the liberal leadership's escape failed to generate a sufficient rating increase for Today.
The morning show Nine aired from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbullo was ousted by Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, has been stranded in London as part of a week-long international television series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This tyranny of distance did not seem to matter to Aussie TV's viewers as much, as it averaged 397,000 viewers in the five major cities compared to 330,000 on Today.
Today saw a slight increase in its ratings compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but the number was only below last quarter (343 000).
Today has been filling the Sunrise gap for the past few months.
In August, it averaged 318,000 in Today, compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
In September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers and Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened this morning.
The winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, friends!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

Big news for Seven was the stunning 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coastal part of New Zealand has an average of a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics were wondering if Thomson could pull off a TV hit without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yes, the results of last night are a clear yes.
The X Factor from Seven retained a strong 1,136 million viewers, smoothly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000)
Seven recorded mixed second night views of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour of the new TV quiz, from 5 to 5:30 p.m., hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (from 5:30 to 6:00 pm) jumped to 623,000 viewers, which was enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
Monday night, the first half of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers and the second half an incredible 720,000.
Hot Seat was averaging 620,000.
With the ratings of The Chase Australia falling from the second night, Nine will be convinced that the Hot Seat will finally win at 5:30.
The Chase Australia has been replaced by the Million Dollar Minute show, which failed to beat McGuire's show.

The three finalists agree that Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect guy - but who will he choose?
The secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezan Markoski may have unintentionally figured out who's gonna win Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood is going to Bachelor with is shrouded in insurmountable secrecy.
And the three girls who stay standing will definitely not reveal who the real one is who will eventually get the rose.
But when we asked Sarah Mackay, Snezan Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before there were only two left, they indicated without a word who would win.
Sam Wood is holding his tongue till Thursday's final.
All three women lyrically sang why Wood was the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they wanted to be his partner.
Anyway, when asked, "If not, who's gonna get Wood's final flower?" their answers could act as a spoiler for who's gonna win Bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and the Markoski quickly named Mackay as the one who would be best suited to Wood apart from them.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been in a light relationship since one day.
"From the moment I walked into the house and observed the energy of Sarah and Sam, I felt they were quite compatible, and I still think about it during the course", says Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is a truly earthly woman, she's a lot of fun", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and there's the right chemistry between them.
They're good and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks Sam Wood and I could make a great couple.
She claims that during his last visits home, she realized that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was no longer just a game - I had now opened my heart to him", she adds.
I asked Wood who he'd pick if he didn't eat her, she looked mysterious.
I don't know if I can say that, she said.
I like both girls equally - it's between Snow White and Lana.
Bachalor is on Wednesday at 7.30am on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have shown a lot of interest in his move to the United States, and a lot of teams have questioned his great start to training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Toms and it seems like a sensible decision.
Some coaches let Hayne sit out the rest of the season because he made a mistake, which led to the Australian Rugby League conversion in the first overtime kick in Tuesday's 20:3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula showed his confidence in the player and gave him another chance to come back and put him in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued to be honest in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of chewing on the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he was able to encourage them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at a press conference after the game.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the mistake and focus on the next game.
In the first quarter against the Minnesota Vikings, Jarryd Hayne corrected his mistake.
It's definitely not the start Hayne and his massive Australian fan club hoped for in his NFL debut.
Hayne was caught cursing as he left the field by mistake and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 a worse start to his NFL career he could not have imagined.
"It happens, you just focus on the next game and that's it", said Hayne.
Hayne compared the trap to his original debut in 2007, when a recording in his own gateway territory led to a Queensland trio.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posted a photo of his fans holding the Australian flag on his Instagram account after the game.
Elton John and Russian Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested for carrying a gun on a Siberian ranway.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company confiscated, and his democratic efforts limited.
The EU has defended immigrants who have claimed property compensation.
The two emigrated in 1984 and their property was acquired by a new owner.
After 1989, the property could no longer be returned, so the couple applied for compensation under the OTC Rehabilitation Act.
The Court first awarded them the amount requested, i.e. over SEK 2,8 million, but the Court of Appeal changed their claim by granting them only SEK 90,000 in full, stating that the amount of compensation was determined by the 1991 price rules.
The immigrants were upheld by the Supreme Court, which attached the original amount to them.
The Ministry of Finance, which was supposed to pay the money, however, lodged a complaint with the SA.
In the meantime, there has been such a change in social and economic conditions that the compensation granted under the legislation in force at the time - although it was then an adequate compensation in relation to the property seized - now amounts to only a fraction of the value of the property.
'This cannot be the burden of the by-parties as a means of restitution to eligible persons who have been claiming their rights since at least 1995 and who had no previous opportunity to receive compensation from the household,' explained Judge Jaroslav Fenyk, rapporteur, why the Court sided with the emigrants.
"The US has repeatedly argued that the courts of general jurisdiction should proceed in restitution cases in such a way that any inconsistencies are not interpreted to the detriment of the entitled and that the purpose of restitution law, namely the remediation of property damage caused by the acts of a former totalitarian state, is always achieved", the judge added.
Evita in the musical Studio DVA is now played by Radka Fisharova.
Radka Fišarová became the world's youngest Evita, by the way, when in 1998, at the age of 20, she played the role of the wife of Argentine dictator Eva Perónova in the first Czech performance of this famous musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Timea Rice at the Prague theatre Spiral.
Returning to the same role, he says, "Evita's performance has not been as challenging as it is today".
Because evita is not just a wonderful role, it's a responsibility.
She was recommended by Monica Absolon as the first lady of Argentina.
I've seen Monch in Evita three times, and it was definitely inspiring to me.
I suddenly saw a whole new concept here.
I'm a big fan of modern modifications, but this one is just particularly well-crafted.
"Andrei Sokol's direction is original, lightweight and contemporary", says Fischer.
The musical staff will be handed over to the two singers at Monica Absolon's Birthday concert on September 27 at 7 p.m. at Studio DVA.
Tonight will culminate with a musical score by Evita.
The experience will certainly include the joint duet Don't Cry For Me Argentina.
In a limited number of performances, Ondřej Sokol will also step off the set as a cast member during the filming of Karl Roden as President Peron.
In the interest of the public, further time limits were then added to the sale until May 2016.
The fifth Czech edition of the world musical Evita is presented by Studio DVA Theatre in collaboration with The Really Useful Group Ltd.
London with success since February 2015.
The film was directed by Andrei Sokol and starred Monica Absolon.
She is joined by Karel Roden as President Perón and Che Peter Strenáčik.
Legendary songs from Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's workshop with Czech lyrics by Michael Prostějovsky are performed by a live orchestra led by Kryštof Mark, who was already involved in the first performance of Spiral.
Four people killed after police fired rubber projectiles at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber projectiles at a crowd of protesters against a new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district chief, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered outside the police station and some threw stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reports that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber projectiles.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, it says.
It was not immediately clear why rubber projectiles, which are known for their ability to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently caused high death rates.
This clash was the latest in a week of violent demonstrations across the southern plains of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say they have established a new province under a proposed new constitution, and has eased their political influence.
Further demonstrations in western Nepal were also recorded by the Tharus ethnic group, which is demanding the creation of its own state.
Since August 10, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, including 11 police officers.
When the four major political parties signed the agreement to divide the country into provinces  a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally controlled for centuries.
Work on the new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers in Kathmandu voted this week on the provisions of the draft constitution, and officials say the new charter should be adopted by Sunday.
We definitely can't panic right now.
After losing the ice championship to Litvinov, you have not even managed a home duel with the Spartans (3:5).
You're not worried about a similarly disastrous extra-league entry to last year?
I hope nothing like this happens again.

NHC predicts a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of Cape Verde
A wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verdean islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing a tropical cyclone formation over the next two days, the Miami-based weather forecaster added.
Google has launched a campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced that it is launching a campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping thousands of refugees who have flooded European countries fleeing war-torn and poor countries.
Google announced this on its blog in a very unusual way.
Google employee Rita Masoud posted the story on her blog based on her personal experience when she fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven.
"We have travelled in many dark trains and buses and experienced hunger, thirst, winter and fear", said Masoud.
I was lucky.
But as the immigration crisis in Europe worsens, more and more families like mine are willing to help.
All the donations will be distributed among four non-profit organizations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that all contributions made through google.com/refugeerelief to the tune of $5.5 million doubled.
Europe is facing the largest wave of refugees since World War II, most of them from Syria, which has been affected by the four-year war that has displaced four million people this year alone.
Many people are fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For mildly obese diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to tell whether mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"The mortality data take a long time to show", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote the introduction to a new JAMA surgical study.
Weight loss surgery, bariatric surgery, uses different methods to shrink the stomach.
Reducing hunger and limiting the human body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done in people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or higher.
BMI, which measures the weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal at between 18.5 and 24.9.
BMI of 25 or higher indicates an individual is overweight and people over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For their new studies, researchers at Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from a 2007 study that looked at two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastriectomy - in treatment procedures for type 3 diabetes in people who were slightly obese.
The average BMI of those who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year, according to the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those who had not received surgery for diabetes remained roughly the same at 29.
Among the patients who had surgery, diabetes was completely resolved in 36 percent and partially resolved in 28 cases.
In the medicated group, only 1% of patients were completely and only 2% were partially treated for diabetes.
Furthermore, control of blood pressure, trigylcerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol was shown to be "generally better in the surgical group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect the body's continuous blood sugar levels.
The best way to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, the researchers say.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the treated group, this value remained at about 8%.
But this improved "glycemic control" - which is reflected in better hemoglobin levels of A1c - did not reduce mortality within five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results with two types of operations.
After the fifth year, the bypass group lost more weight compared to the gastriectomy group (18.7 to 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 percent to 2.1 percent) and were more likely to have diabetes remission (46.9 percent to 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no improvement in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of stronger people in Sweden, where they found that surgery leads to longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who had bariatric surgery had about a 29 percent greater chance of survival over the next 15 years than the group who had tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any improvement in survival among patients after surgery, Blackstone says this is a reassuring result for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in these procedures.
"This is where this work is critical, because it says surgery is safer in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone also goes on to say that people and their doctors should start taking their weight really seriously after a patient's BMI drop between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to let people know the gravity of the situation", he says.
I think once you accumulate these genetic changes that bind their bodies to obesity and diabetes, the road back is really hard.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe is not able to accommodate all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the refugees' homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to the study of ethics, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He argued that under the present circumstances the interests of mankind should be put before the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries, however admirable, to the refugee crisis was inadequate in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to resolve the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a few thousand refugees, but in the meantime you will have to think about a long-term solution to bring about real peace and real development, especially through education in these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Finally, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to limit the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the charges against George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attack, claiming that "the US' violent response has triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my sincere condolences in a letter to President Bush and advised him that the way to solve this problem was not by violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and created unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children who have taken a sanitary product in the last four years
Toxicology centers around the United States reported an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who ingested a highly alcoholic sanitizer since 2010, according to the Toxicology Center of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the number of children under 12 years of age who were reported to poison control centers for use of sanitary products increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more access to these products, and unfortunately, there is a percentage of children who have to be taken to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
Some children drink sanitation deliberately, while others want to impress their friends or as a social media challenge.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking toiletries because of cheap rumors.
The teenagers reportedly mixed a toilet with oral water containing alcohol for a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive scent of the drug.
"Children don't think it could hurt them", Lopez said.
Many more attractive (sanitary) are those that are perfumed.
To deposit, there are sanitary products with the scent of strawberries, grapefruit or oranges that are very attractive to children.
The sanitary device contains between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few locks can be alcohol poisoning.
"This is a highly concentrated alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, MD, director of the University of Kansas Hospital Toxicology Control Center, on Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just let a glass of whiskey roll over, but people leave those sanitary products out there, and when kids get to them, it's a quick way to consume alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently saw four loops of strawberry-flavored sanitary detergent at school and was taken to the ER for emergency treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the threshold for an adult considered intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah spoke vague words and was unable to walk after arriving at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for any signs of brain trauma, as the girl fell and hit her head with alcohol, Ritchey says.
"It was very scary", said CNN's Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or make sanitary facilities out of reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some sanitary devices have been linked to death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a sanitary device containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Doctors believed that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-year students in upstate New York planned to poison their "bad" teacher by placing antibacterial products in the room", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to sanitation and has banned it from the room.
Police have described the foiled plan as "innocent gossip", referring to the school district's discipline,
Fame: No inconsistency in the Celtic team
Griffiths downplayed the disagreement in Celtic while Deila admitted that the Hoops were in the wrong place, but he turned it around again.
Hearts will fight the SFA against an attack on Nelson, and Warburton is concerned that the new reinforcements from January will disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons are up 5 points ahead of Celtic
The penalty from the first half in the hands of Adam Rooney secured Aberdeen a close victory over Hamilton at Pittodria, giving the Dons a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denies the disagreement
This situation has sparked rumors of inconsistency at Celtic, which have been denied by Griffiths, who insists that he and his teammates are not working under any pressure from increased oversight in preparation for a match with the Dutch league leaders.
I don't think we're feeling under any pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The Netherlands are bored of the lack of Scottish title rivalry.
Former Rangers defender and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer claims that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic - because there is no longer any rivalry between them over the title.
De Boer, who is currently Ajax's ambassador, says: "They're not showing the best of Celtic's games in the Netherlands anymore, and why?"
Because there are no Rangers anymore.
People here aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
He's talking about the Old Company.
He's talking about the two teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension at the Old Company games, and it's not just people from Scotland who watch these games.
I'm going to turn things around, Deila commits.
Rooney Dealia admitted that Celtic are a little off the hook, but the Norwegian boss has pledged to turn things around.
Malm's defeat and subsequent relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a defeat against Aberdeen, who had only 10 players and now stands at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila says, "Celtic have had a bad time and will rise again".
Now we want to get out of this as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are really, really upset or sad about what's happening right now.
We're on the same page - but we have to move on.
We really need Celtic's support because it makes the players so much better.
It's very important to stay together now.
Warburton is concerned about January reinforcements.
Despite comments coming out a few weeks ago suggesting he's already identified some of his January targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is concerned about the large-scale reinforcement purchase and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox team.
"The weekly transfer window is very different from the summer one", says the former head of Brentford.
Players who come in the summer have a full preseason to stay, which you could see on our own team this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to those you really need.
The transitional target of Celtic Mich indicates retirement
Swansea forward Mitch, who was linked with Celtic in the transfer window, has hinted that he could retire after his contract with Swansea expires.
The 20-year-old shooter has been struggling with a fragile ankle for two years and has not been able to find his way out of Wales this summer.
Hearts will be fighting the SFA over comments against Neilson
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was sent to the dressing room and eventually lost 3-2, but the red card on this defender was later revoked - the third red card issued by referee Collum, which was revoked.
Neilson stands by his claim, stating, "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance".
Griffiths has pledged to avoid Tynecastle.
The stubborn Hibbe was severely punished after admitting to singing a song with lyrics aimed at former Hearts player Rudolph Skácel.
The incident occurred at a pub in the Roserburn area of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a hectic moment", the striker said, adding: "I can safely say that I will not return to Tynecastle unless it is in Celtic's dress".
The Tannadice Council believes in the management of Dundee United - Donelly
Simon Donelly insists that the Dundee United board still believes the current management of the team can correct the situation - but admits that the downturn on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys back to action", Donnelly promises.
MC Innes is happy for the "ugly win" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to cling desperately to Hamilton Accies to secure their seventh consecutive league win and a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to a penalty shoot-out from the first half in the hands of Adam Rooney.
McInnes reports: "There is no team that has won anything, whether cups or leagues, without winning this kind of game".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while overall UK unemployment rises
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged at 164 000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK rose by 10 000 to 1,82 million during the same period.
The Scottish unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above the UK rate of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile employment in Scotland has fallen by 12 000 in a three-month period, the number of workers has now stopped at 2 612 000.
Employment in Scotland fell during the quarter to 74.0 percent - above the British average of 73.5 percent.
Scotland's Secretary of State, David Mundell, said in commenting on the latest figures: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly one year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvement in the labour market and Scottish employment has grown while unemployment has fallen.
Why I Witnessed the Oklahoma Execution
Later today, despite a late legal intervention, I will be watching a man's execution.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four officers who would witness his death.
I first got an invitation in January from my best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day draws near, I'm starting to worry about it.
Then why am I doing this?
I accepted this invitation because I think it's a good way to tell you the whole story about the death penalty.
It would give me a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and because there are often more requests than vacancies, a morbid lottery is being held to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma cut the number of journalism posts from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch the entire execution unhindered.
I can't do that.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends and make a special connection to him through a month of phone calls and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like that boy.
We often laugh when we talk to each other.
The prison department says I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I won't be allowed to write a notebook and I won't be able to record what I see.
I'm just gonna have to memorize all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my neutrality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the story of the behavior as he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted she could have put it better, but she still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and even if he did, I wouldn't listen to him.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list anytime.
But he wants an international journalist who'll be on the ground ready to tell the story.
He thinks if he dies, his case will help with the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be by my side.
For more information on the case, please listen to a series of podcasts I've created.
I'm not gonna repeat all the details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would make him guilty of complicity in the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's innocent of murder.
I firmly believe that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
In my opinion, execution is wrong.
And it's from this perspective that I'm going to watch his death.
I can't say I'm really being objective.
You can contact other journalists for this purpose.
What you get from me is the experience of seeing a person I love die a needless death.
A man escaped from Canning River after a police chase
Officer Canning Vale was left dry after he evacuated the men from Canning River.
Peter's bet on running from the police didn't come true after he got into shallow muddy water just a few feet from the cop who tried to force him back to shore.
Canning Vale police were called to the scene of an incident that stretched to Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they saw the suspect, he tried to get rid of them by escaping across the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"He stood in the water and repeated 'I'm not going out, just come for me,'" said Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform, so he tried a safer tactic, the police negotiation".
"People sometimes try to do funny things on the run", Castledine said.
Football champion Ben Cousins sets a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove to the canyon to avoid the bus and try to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were in vain, but he inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the organizers tried to spy on him and threatened to end the race.
Peeter Moody accused the Racing Victoria organizers of trying to get a spy into his barn last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the organisers and the Racing Victoria integrity department, and was convinced that they had a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatay scratching late in maintenance on race day, which was his last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for the race and he's found himself in a difficult situation with Lidari's positive cobalt rash that he can't explain.
He bit his tongue about the espionage charge for 18 months and didn't want it to look like "dried grapes".
"I didn't want to say anything about sitting on it for a long time, but you just feel so frustrated that it's all coming out of you all at once", Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences, and I'm gonna have to live with what I said.
I'm going home today and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to keep my head up and make the owners think I'm doing the best I can for them.
If they start thinking otherwise, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I'll have to consider what I'm doing with my license after that.
Earlier, Moody had bombed a racing.com interview saying the integrity of the department was trying to spy on him.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name after the question - and offered him a job in my stable to find out about things that were going on in my stable", Moody told Racing.com.
Of course they thought I was a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all show their information because they were burned to death trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL chairman, David Moodie, current RVL chairman, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Should I think this is becoming a personal matter?
Will RVL grow a few balls and get people outside the coaching position to take responsibility for what's happening in this industry?
Am I bad for this industry?
Am I really that bad for this industry?
Maybe the locals think so.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt what I'm saying now will give them something to think about.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care anymore, and I'm sad.
It really upset me.
I'm going to push them and put the burden on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's frustration levels have increased with a long investigation into the cobalt, including Lidari, and a recent scratch on him that has given him the feeling that he "could be hours away from his license on the table".
Mood, best known for preparing the undefeated Black Caviar champion, called the race day treatment rule "mixed" after a clay coating or mud was applied to the horse's legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for it", he said.
Someone on my team accidentally put mud on his foot.
He could have had it last night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it happened.
It happened on race day.
Moody faced a three-month disqualification for treatment of packaging on the day of the race for which the organisers had already opened an investigation.
It's a joke, you know.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The Cobram driver who escaped was arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a cyclist in Cobram over the weekend and left after the collision.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured rider.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia man confessed to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with non-stop-attendance, non-provision of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is backing his rivals for a wrestling claim.
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm, has criticized his players' actions as "setting a plan" by two NRL premiership favourites.
Trent Robinson, coach of the Sydney Roosters, said the referees allowed Storm players to "wrestle" his players during the Storm's controversial victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Wayne Bennet, coach of the Brisbane Broncos, made a slightly covert remark about Strorm after his team won the qualifying final over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "show" of rugby league and saying two Queenslanders were "not too big" for wrestling.
Bellamy defended his players' actions and said they focused on "contact" during the game.
Bellamy added that the situation has given him more confidence because his team is being criticized by two head coaches, which may mean they're afraid of losing to the Storm.
"It's always coming - I don't remember Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we were beaten 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defense system and techniques over the past year, but we've only been emphasizing contact during the interventions over the past few weeks, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been here three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, which could have been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how things like this always come up this time of year.
Bellamy belittled Bennet's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennet's St George-Illawarra Dragons team won the 2010 premiership by playing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He was right that his Saturday game was just as exciting as ours.
I remember back in 2010, St. George got criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can play a style of play that he finds overwhelming, especially his young fans with their speed.
That's the kind of football you'd want to play if you had that kind of players.
He said that in 2010, and now he wants all the teams to play his style of football -- but not every team has two quarterbacks like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that style.
It makes me more confident because they say things like that because they're afraid of fighting us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't even think of us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed to the fact that the Storm and Roosters scored more goals than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos were probably good, I didn't watch, but what's the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, we had two more tries in our game, but is this exciting football?
Or is the breaks and the scoring of the tries interesting?
I think it's the agenda.
If we're mentioned, it means we'll definitely meet again at some point.
The Storm are off this weekend and have won the right to host either the North Queensland Cownboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the preliminary final next Saturday night at AAMI Park.
Serbian man was given $200,000 bail for drug charges
A man facing a possible life sentence for possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled out of Queensland has been given a $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by federal police for searches for 100 kilograms of drugs from the Solay yacht, which arrived from South America via Vanuatu and anchored in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was spotted meeting the co-defendants in the harbor during the morning and later met them at Coomer Roadhouse's coffee shop, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs in the Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of commercial-grade cocaine, Maksimovica's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he owned the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe by accident and innocent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan thought Maximovic would have escaped.
He has a clear connection to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often", he said in court Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he lived in the Crown case.
Maksimovica's mother and stepfather have offered a $200,000 bail for his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both parties, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
Their efforts alone were clearly insufficient, because the defendant did not go further to court, he warned.
Maksimović was granted bail on condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and abide by the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was asleep, then logged into her online chat room, where he had a lot of indecent photos of kids sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up and found her phone missing, and then found it in the hands of sleeping Hogg.
She went through it and before she could tell her mother, she found disturbing news.
Police engaged and saw five photographs, then analytics computers found the address and discovered a "disturbing" web search using terms to search for child pornography.
Hogg then told the police that his reason was to "post pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretending to be a police officer and scaring them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to doing the computer searches, but he claims he was just pretending to be a cop to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversation with an unknown person who sent him pictures and why he wanted her to send another one.
He thinks he was doing it to lure them
He says he jumped out of his drunken state and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she called her mother, trembled, and cried.
She saw the immoral images on her phone and the defendant was then confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told how the defendant used her computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hog, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to a charge of receiving or providing inappropriate images of children on 14 June last year, breached bail on 25 January and failed to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Advocate Gregor Sim requested that Hogg be removed from the list of sex offenders because he could argue that there was "no substantial sexual underlying" in his act.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentence to October for filing a social worker report.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody pending further proceedings.
He was placed on the sex offender list before the date of his sentencing.
Zimbabwean Robert Mugabe made a bad speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs leading to the stage earlier this year.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of his fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also tarnished by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous death threats warning them against Mr Mugabe's speech being spoken out.
Last month, he was spit out and provoked during his State of the Nation address in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The chairman of the MP's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) club, Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interfere with Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The report comes from a number that does not appear, but is called 'death,'" he told reporters after Mr Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned that their immunity in Parliament is terminated and that once they leave Parliament, their immunity in Parliament is not in effect.
The chief said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai had "fears" about threats against lawmakers.
Hewlett-Packard is going to cut the number of jobs to 30,000.
Hewlett-Packard will eliminate between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring efforts and cost savings on the business services of the company.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing hardware and service operations.
The expected job reduction will result in a change of about $2.7 billion and will begin in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring activities will enable us to create a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", says Meg Whitman, HP CEO and chairman of the board, who will lead the unit after the split.
"The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more sophisticated than HP today and will have a broad and extensive portfolio of businesses that will help enterprises transition to a new business style", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we will be in a much better position to meet the evolving demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Parckard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion following the company's announcement and "will be focused on providing unrivalled integrated technology solutions" to companies.
This will lead to the demise of a company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who made electrical equipment and whose Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has been undergoing massive reorganization to manage the move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest tech companies in America, is the latest in the industry based on the belief that a highly specialized company has better results.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that the teammates must get behind the injured Jack Wilshere in front of Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger also stressed to Wilshere that it's still September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there's no reason he shouldn't play again on Christmas.
This best-case scenario means Wilshere will miss at least four more English games and, from a historical point of view, his involvement in the next summer European Championship is obviously uncertain.
The big regret of this latest problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after an ankle injury and then got back to his former form during preseason.
"This kind of injury doesn't endanger a career", says Wenger.
It's a wound that needs healing.
It's not that special.
It was just an accident.
It wasn't about his ankles or the injuries he'd suffered before.
That could be purely medical, because Wenger admitted that there is a relative risk of further injury whenever any player returns during the season.
There's also an unpleasant pattern.
A survey by Premier Injuries Ltd. records 23 different injuries to Wilsher since making his debut six years ago.
During the last five years he only played in 65 league games for Arsenal out of a total of 157:
From a broader perspective, this means that in six of the eight seasons from 2007-08 Arsenal were one of the two Premier League clubs to lose the most days due to injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of the enchanted circle, but Arsenal believe that improvements in the area of injuries recorded during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win the competition", says Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get out of this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal start their Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing to rotate his team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be on board.
Wenger could also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Montreal's Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and let the players who need it out", says Wenger.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for promotion from Group F, Maksimir in Zagreb has a reputation for being the most intimidating stadium in Europe.
Dinamo also went undefeated in 41 games after keeping their campaign unbeaten last season.
The stadium was shaken by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday night.
It was the seventh time in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and has long held out hope of leading the club to their first European Cup victory.
"This deployment is tremendous", says Wenger.
That never happened to Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I have to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that teaches us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar depictions in various shows is striking, especially given the need for men to open up more desperately than ever before to suicide among young men under 15.
In 2013, it was the single leading cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK and remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address this issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) has designated 2015 as the Year of Men, which aims to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when needed.
At the heart of this struggle lies friendship to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who showed symptoms of depression found that if the affected person had a high enough percentage of "healthy" friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends is half the chance of mental problems.
But for friendship to work, of course, it must first be attainable.
In this social media communication, with an emphasis on style rather than content, immediate response is often preferred to meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to look stronger, more fun-loving, and more successful, even though we're more isolated in reality.
This superficial success is controlled by what psychologists call external values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of our real values -- our personal desire for growth and friendship -- which have a profound effect on our mental health.
And as one billionaire and game designer recently explained, money really doesn't buy more happiness.
The beauty of Friends was the source of his thought.
None of the characters were defined by their work, but by their personalities that radiated through friendly interaction.
Joey's humor and Chandler's frequent victims, moments of watching football in comfortable chairs, Ross' desire for Rachel, all come from knowing that yes, men can also relate to it, even though they usually keep their feelings to themselves.
As one Samaritan worker explained to me, "...my role as a listener of people who are depressed or suicidal has really confirmed to me that even the smallest interactions of friendship can make a difference".
Men who contact us often feel unable to communicate with their friends.
The old saying "dealing with it" is strong in the sense that it will be seen as weak to open up about problems.
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind as I try to offer a longer-term settlement mechanism.
It highlights the small moments in a man's friendship.
As for my job, the outsider's phone status helps people in times of despair, but long-term support has to come from a greater circle of friends and family.
So if you're going to the FrendsFest this weekend hosted by Comedy Central, why not take your friends for a drink to Central Perk, where the interior will be completely redesigned for the occasion.
Or if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile at them and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from start to finish - 236 episodes in total - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scored and helped PSG to put Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blais Matuid and Edinson Cavan after shooting the gate against Malma.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG beat Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the game response.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani both scored in Tuesday's match and Paris Saint-Germain began their journey to the Champions League with a final comfortable 2-0 win over Malma at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes after his Champions League debut and this PSG player sent the French champions to win, but then they missed a few chances until they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored the goal with his head in the 61st minute.
Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk are also in Group A, and therefore the Paris team needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they are not only focused on qualifying for the knockout rounds but on improving their way to the quarter-finals, which they have achieved in each of the previous three seasons.
But even though they scored three points, it wasn't a classic performance for Laurent Blanc and Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a waste at the gate and was later substituted against his home team and club, where he began his famous career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League on the field or at home, so a 2-0 win makes our opponents problems and looking comfortable on defense is a good start, although there are things we'll have to improve on as the season progresses", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, and yet I regret not shooting one or two more shots.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury as one of three changes to PSG, who had a 2-2 draw at home this weekend with Bordeaux in Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was billed as the man who will take PSG to a new level in Europe after a move from Manchester United last month, and showed why, when he ran for the pass of Marc Verratti to defend Malm and with a beautiful finish sent the ball behind Johan Wiland to a distant corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected this to kick off PSG's grand victory, he must have been disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in the play-offs and made it to the final, came on with nine internationals in the starting line-up and five defenders and two drawn backs were heavy opponents.
But apart from the Nikola Djurdjica rocket, which just passed the far corner of Kevin Trapp's gate in the 34th minute, there was little to offer in the attack.
Instead, PSG themselves were arguing for the advantage of the attack with poor play and a miserable finish, which was not good either from Ibrahimovic, who failed to shoot even five times in the first half, and was then disappointed because his shot came into the net shortly after the start of Cavani's second half.
However, he proved much more suitable when it came to preparing the chances for his teammates and it was from his game that Di Maria sent a spin shot that ended up in Wiland's goal after 52 minutes.
The second goal came after one hour thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic played him from the left wing of Maxwell.
This ended all Malm's thoughts about the possibility of a game, and only Wiland's excellent close-up move dashed David Luiz's hopes and the score remained unchanged even as the substitute Ezekiel Lavezzi's goal was not recognised at the end of the game.
Malmo Age Hareide's manager later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, Nor said: "Our last Champions League game was last December".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
Qualifying isn't enough.
A hat down for Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion from the stock sales.
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which was hit by the collapse in commodity prices, made $2.5 billion in stock sales on Wednesday as part of its extensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
This company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is facing a commodity price fallout as China's slowing economy reduces demand and ignites sparks of collapse across markets.
Rights issues have pushed Glencore's share price to a high point on the London stock market in the early morning trades on Wednesday.
Shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence in the FTSE 100, which opened up 0.69 percent.
Glencore revealed last week that the sale of $2.5 billion in stock is part of a larger plan to reduce their $30 billion debt, which has accumulated by about a third.
The company sold new shares at 123 pence per share, which was a 2.4% discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
They have now lost 1.3 billion shares at a total price of 9.99 percent per group.
Fears of prolonging the slowdown in China's growth have cut iron ore prices by almost half, and coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirmed that Washington has visited Xi Jinping
Chinese President Xi Jinping will visit the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in its report on Tuesday.
President Xi's first visit to Washington will take place on September 25 in response to Barack Obama's visit to Beijing in November, the report said.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will invite President Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan, to a state dinner after the talks.
President Xi's visit represents an opportunity to strengthen US-China relations and encourage cooperation in addressing international, regional and common interest issues, and is an opportunity for constructive debate on the differences between the two countries, adds the report.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is scheduled to visit Seattle, where he will meet with several US technical leaders on his way to Washington, and then continue on to New York for the September UN meeting.
Obama and Xi are expected to address contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and its growing aggression in the waters of the South China Sea.
How the refugee crisis has shattered the Schengen area.
The emergency lighting fired by Germany has not yet blotted out the European crew, but it is now forcing the ship to change course, wrote the French daily Le Figaro.
The European Union decided on Monday to tackle the refugee problem first: it would rather systematically sort migrants and asylum seekers as soon as they enter the old continent - especially Greece - than argue over the future quota-based distribution of refugees, which is increasingly out of step with reality.
Six days after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker asked 25 of the 28 EU countries to resettle 160,000 refugees, the interior ministers of the Member States have changed their priority.
Before we can decide the final destination of refugees, we need to filter out those who arrive today and decide the fate of those who are already moving within the Schengen area.
'Effective management of the EU's external borders is essential to managing migration', stresses the text discussed by ministers in Brussels on Monday.
Following the crisis of the common currency, the EU is finding itself at risk in its next major integration project.
Germany may be surprised, but it's not losing its resolve and increasing pressure.
It is re-establishing border controls, especially with Austria, but without blocking the flow of asylum seekers to that country.
The central power is clearly showing that without it no free movement in Europe is possible.
The fact that Austria and Slovakia joined the measure on Monday already served as evidence.
Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium and even France are also considering this, albeit with varying intensity.
Hungary has already done so.
These exceptional and temporary measures are admissible under the Schengen rules.
That it's a domino effect, but he's also blind.
A key issue for Berlin and Paris is now the effective introduction of mandatory entry checks in Greece, southern Italy and also in Hungary for those who have already entered the interior.
The French Minister of the Interior, Bernard Cazeneuve, and his German colleague, Thomas de Maizière, discussed this matter intensively in private with their three colleagues from Greece, Italy and Hungary.
This idea is not new, but it is a hard-core idea.
In Italy, according to unofficial statistics, two thirds of new arrivals have already been registered and identified by fingerprinting.
Budapest refuses to establish any entry point on its territory because it fears more than others that camps will be left on its shoulders, where refugees will pile up on its behalf.
The real black hole is Greece.
More than 200,000 people landed on its islands off the Turkish coast this year, twice as many as recently in Italy.
Most of them are real asylum seekers who came directly from Syria after passing through overcrowded camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.
It's a huge, gigantic hole.
Athens, still in financial trouble and waiting for a new government, put their hands in their lap.
This is the starting point for the Balkan journey and a source of common concern for German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
The Juncker Commission promises to establish checkpoints as soon as possible, but it has not given a number or date.
"The challenges facing Greece are for the whole of Europe", the EU interior ministers agreed on Monday to mobilise on this front.
The European Border Agency's Frontex task force is therefore to be deployed in this country.
The EU wants to help Greece expand its asylum capacity and strengthen its surveillance of the islands.
'A reasonable financial resources will be needed,' warns the text submitted to the ministers for approval.
In legal terms, they will continue to have the last word from Athens.
The question of the creation of genuine European border guards has not been officially raised, but Europe is getting closer.
The new emergency situation in the 1980s has in any case shifted the question of binding quotas and 160,000 refugees to the second round, which was already raised earlier this year by the Juncker Commission and the European Parliament and strongly supported by Angela Merkel and French President François Hollande.
Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland still don't want to hear about it.
They see it as an attack on their sovereignty.
The number, not the obligation, was kept on Monday in a text approved by a majority of 28.
But as a political commitment.
In other words, the process is interrupted.
The only firm promise is to reallocate 40,000 refugees over the next two years, as agreed at the EU's hectic summit in June, Le Figaro concludes.
Seven dead under an avalanche in the Alps, three of them reportedly Czechs.
Three Czechs and four Germans are among seven tourists killed by an avalanche in the French Alps.
German authorities say she is also the only survivor of the eight affected groups.
Previously on the news, it was Polk.
A woman in her 30s was hospitalized in the city of Briancon with a serious leg injury to her femur.
The dead, according to AFP, were mostly men in their 40s.
"The rescue operation is over, and the bodies of the victims have been transferred to Briancon for identification", said Pierre Besnard, prefect of the Hautes-Alpes department.
The disaster occurred around noon in the Pelvoux mountain range at the top of the 4015-meter-high Dôme de Neige des Ecrins.
"The sudden avalanche was 250 meters wide and about a meter high", said rescue chief Nicolas Colombani.
He says that a group of eight people were covered in snow at an altitude of about 3,900 feet.
The weather service did not warn the area of adverse weather today.
Torture before the match with Braga: finally true Europe.
Coach Jindřich Trpišovsky, on his Cup debut, managed to get through the European League with the Liberce players to the base group and now he's looking forward to enjoying the real Europe with the team.
The Slovenian welcomes the 2011 finalist from Braga to the opening of the main stage of the competition and according to the coach wants to impose his style of play on her.
After all the nerve in elimination fights, where every goal and every situation could have ruled you out on your way to the dream group, now we're there and we're gonna play six games.
Of course we want to win, but we don't have to worry about every goal scored, we can play our tactics and we're not tied to just a double.
"I'm really looking forward to it and this is real Europe, it was just qualifying before", Trpišovsky said at a press conference.
Braga thinks he's the best team.
He's going to be very active, they've got only Brazilian, Portuguese and Spanish players who are good at the ball.
The opponent may be harder to beat by not having that name, but he has a player in his squad who I think has scored three goals for Manchester.
"It's a great team at the top level", Trpišovsky said.
But he doesn't consider Braga a clear favorite.
I take it we're playing at home, so we're definitely not outsiders.
"I think we have shown that we are strong at our stadium, both at home and in the pre-season, and we want to confirm that", said the coach, whose team lost only the inaugural Super Cup in Plzeň from 11 duels this season.
He believes that the Liberer can impose his style on Braze.
We've got a team that's going to be strong on the ball, and unusually disciplined for them.
They're playing from a 4-4-2 standings with a quick transition to the offensive phase.
"He's a very tough opponent, we've discovered weaknesses, but the most important thing will be how our players do it on the pitch", Trpišovsky said.
We've been studying our opponents a lot in the pre-season, which has helped us a lot, but this time we want to focus on our game, which is what we've adapted our training to.
"And we definitely want, even if it's very difficult, to play by our notes", added the coach.
Student films dominate the Sands, an international film festival begins.
Over 350 authors from 51 countries have submitted their works for the 15th annual International Student Film Festival in Písek.
Four dozen of them, which the students and teachers' committee sent to the final, will be shown from 15 to 18 October at the Portyč cinema.
The best of them will be chosen by an international jury, said festival spokesman Jacob Charvat.
Each year, the festival has a special theme that evolves from the festival's theme.
She's a detective this year.
This year's festival night director Richard Blumenfeld plans to bring together elements of television, film and theater.
"And of course we must also solve the crime that was committed in our trip this year", said Charvat.
Visitors will see a selection of the most interesting of the student's works - feature films, animated and documentary.
They will be judged by an international jury, which will include last year's winner, director Miklas Manneke, Spanish director Claudio Niubo and British producer Hemant Sharda.
As every year, the festival organisers prepare an accompanying programme.
There will be Wattican Punk Ballet from Armenia, singer Ondřej Ruml, professional didgeridoo player Ondřej Smeykal, turbo band Poletíme?, playing the band Zrní or for example Petra Hapková with the recital Life at the bar.
The festival will also host two photography exhibitions.
The first entry is from the Sand Film School and the recipient of prestigious awards, including the World Press Photo 2014, Jana Ašenbrenner.
The second exhibition will bring the atmosphere that prevailed in Nepal after the tragic earthquake closer.
The film The Cameraman will be accompanied by Gerhard Gruber and the village's native Brukner, Novotny and Hlach in the studio of sculptor Jan Novotny will be baptizing his new book 3 friends from the city of P.
This year we also remember Miroslav Ondříček, patron of FAMO in the Sand, who recently left us.
Our school and the festival are his legacy that will live on.
"Young people from all over the world will continue to meet here, exchange experiences and develop common bonds and the film industry", the spokesman said.
The Pitching Forum, where students can meet film professionals, audition multiple times at once and get a job, will certainly help.
The festival is linked to the establishment of the Private Higher Vocational Film School in Sand.
Its founders, Vladan and Miloň Terčovi, organized the first year in 1997.
It was once every two years until the sixth grade.
In the event of a CK default, the insurance companies are to pay the full amount of the claims of the clients.
Insurance companies should pay the full amount of the claims of the clients in the event of the travel agency's bankruptcy.
The House decided on this Wednesday when it approved an amended version of the Travel Conditions Act.
Travel agencies will be able to replace bank collateral with a bank collateral if the proposal is submitted to the Senate for consideration.
Insurance companies are not willing to pay claims of clients even above the agreed limit.
The Ministry of Local Development is insisting on the adjustment, arguing consumer protection.
Insurance companies have already threatened to end travel insurance against bankruptcy once the mortgage is paid.
But the proposal is also being criticized by travel agencies.
Without insurance, they'll either have to quit or go abroad.
Minister for Local Development Karla Šlecht (for ANO) pointed out that cases where insurance companies have not paid full compensation are not euro-compliant.
She pointed to this year's ruling by the Constitutional Court that confirmed that the client is entitled to a full refund regardless of the insurance limit.
The insurance companies will be given enough information about the management of travel agencies and will be able to set the correct limit, she stressed.
"We appreciate the effort to increase consumer protection, but it must have such a limit to be realistic", said TOP 09 Vice-President Miroslav Kalousek.
He says a bank guarantee won't work because nobody gives it unlimited.
"Travel agencies will have to stop or move abroad", Kalousek warned.
The President of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies and the Agency Tomio Okamura (SPD) disagreed with Kalouskov's concerns on the basis of a survey among the member CKs.
"Stop showing us insurance lobbying", he said.
The statement by the insurers is not considered relevant by Okamura and no official written statement by them to that effect is available.
They're trying to figure out if travel agencies are going to be involved, which Okamura says is not a problem.
The Czech authorities have also warned against the provision by Jana Fischerová (ODS), who referred to the opinion of the competing Association of Travel Agencies of the Czech Republic, and her party colleague Petr Bendl, who spoke about the Czech travel agency's de-escalating of the stairs.
Fischer says travel agents won't be able to negotiate insurance.
"Consumer protection is working", Fischer says.
Her motion to release the disputed passage was rejected by the House.
Neither Vojtěch Filip (KSČM) proposed returning the proposal to the committee because of an alleged conflict with the Civil Code.
Philip warned travel agencies that he believed could endanger consumers.
The rapporteur, Martina Berdych (ANO), withdrew her proposal, in view of the Constitutional Court ruling, which would limit the liability of insurers in cases where they could not have known that insurance performance did not cover the full risk.
The new policy will not initially propose a minimum insurance limit of 4 million for travel agencies offering air travel and a million limit for sales agencies, such as bus travel.
The border will remain at 30% of the planned turnover from the sales of the tours.
However, the insurance performance limit will have to be such that in the event of a bankruptcy the travel agent covers all customer claims.
The standard, even after the amendments, stipulates that travel agencies will have to re-enter which travel agency organises the tours for the tours sold.
Travel agencies will have to submit to the insurance companies, before the contract is concluded, among other things, details of the handling and number of trips.
The approved amendment by the Public Administration Committee also includes further regular information for insurance companies.
Travel agencies will have to provide them with monthly data on the number of passengers and tickets sold, the total price of tickets sold and the amount of travel and ticket sales and advances.
If the Ministry of Local Development finds that the travel agency has failed to fulfil any of the statutory obligations towards the insurance company, it may recall it under the proposal for a correction or may prohibit it from concluding new contracts if the breach of the obligation could jeopardise the interests of customers.
The new scheme also aims to reorganise the financing of the mountain service.
The Ministry of Local Development will determine the amount of the grant to the mountain service on the basis of its application, which it will submit until the end of April for the next year.
The request will contain a report on the use of public funds in the past year, a financial plan for expenditure and a outlook for the next two years.
But according to the association, the lawmaker hadn't thought about the situation that would arise if the insurance company cancelled the contract with CK.
He's not allowed to take trips, and clients who bought trips before the insurance policy was cancelled will lose him, according to the association.
In such a case, the CK will suffer a significant loss and may even fail, even if its management was in good condition.
One of the ways that travel agencies can handle such a situation is to sue the State for compensation.
Another option would be to go abroad and use the much softer conditions abroad and then in our market we will act only as agencies, said Jan Papage, vice president of the association.
The draft of the new law also contains a bank guarantee institution, but so unconsciously that it cannot be implemented in practice at all, since a bank guarantee cannot be considered as an unlimited amount.
Moreover, the Association considers that a change in existing practice is de facto unnecessary.
In the next two years, the new EU directive will require a new revision of the whole law.
A total of 942 active insured travel agents now operate on the Czech market.
Only three CKs ceased operations this year.
Domestic travel agencies sell about 20 billion CZK worth of trips annually.
Merkel: We need to improve conditions in the Middle East.
The European Union must work to improve the humanitarian conditions in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon in order to limit the influx of refugees into Europe.
This was announced by German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting with German prime ministers.
It also reiterated its call for the distribution of refugees already arriving in the EU among the 28 Member States.
We need to do more to help countries where refugees leave or stay after leaving their homeland.
I expect a signal from the European Union that we will be setting up a dignified environment in refugee camps, for example in Jordan and Lebanon, the German chancellor said, saying that such a signal could also be increased financial aid or closer EU cooperation with international humanitarian organisations.
"The EU countries also support the German government in promoting a fair distribution of the refugee crisis' weight to European countries", Merkel added.
In this context, Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke of Brandenburg said at a press conference that he expected genuine solidarity from all EU countries.
The Czech Republic has long refused to allocate refugees in the EU on the basis of quotas.
Merkel and Woidke also spoke out in favour of accelerating asylum procedures in Germany.
People need to know as soon as possible if they have a chance to stay here.
It is also necessary for the authorities to start integrating foreigners faster, said the prime minister of Brandenburg.
He also believes that most of the money Germany spends on refugee care should be used to integrate those who have a chance of obtaining asylum.
It will take more teachers to teach the refugees German.
It's a big challenge for our country, but I believe that if the runners manage to integrate, they can be a boon to us, he said.
Matt Damon downplaying the diversity of the movie
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity with the claim that it wasn't necessary behind the scenes.
During the HBO Sunday episode of Greenlight, the actress who was cast in the series interrupted Brown as she stressed the need for alternative views about the black protagonists in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it by casting a movie, not casting a show", Damon says.
Shocked, she reacted indignantly to Brown with distrust and sighed, "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments about the Martian got on the air.
Damon and Brown have teamed up with the famous producer Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
"I'd like to appeal to people to think, whoever the director is, how they're going to treat the character of Harmony", Brown said at the beginning.
The only black character who's a whore is a white pimp.
Producer of Dear White People has been suing finalists Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film; Damon has said that their directing "may eventually give us something we don't want".
After the discussion went live, social media exploded in disagreement with Damon's comment.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed anger at the video, "Matt Damon jumped into the only black woman in the room so he can explain to her that diversity is SO BIG that it hurts".
The tweet has gained over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comment comes at a time when the precise representation of race in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national attention and pressured lawmakers and authorities to refrain from discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made references to the movement while announcing the nominations for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albas are still important", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leader of Black Lives Matter issued a statement in response to a question from Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a charity group", the leaders said.
Damon was recently named to the list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or had already met the pope is unclear.
The American Ninja Warrior has its first winner.
Professional mountaineer and mountaineer Isaac Caldiero became the first competitor to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday and take home one million dollars.
In the competition, which just ended its seventh season, none of the contestants managed to overcome all obstacles on the track.
During the final of this season, two men fought their way to the final round, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten.
The last hurdle was a 30-second climb on a 220-meter-long rope.
Britten climbed the first climb within the set limit, becoming the first competitor to cross the challenging 4 sections in the American Ninja Warrior, however Caldiero overtook him by three seconds and won the race.
Caldiero gave an interview to E! News right after his hard-earned win and it was revealed that he was still in shock from winning the $1 million grand prize.
"It's an amazing feeling, I've never made more than $10,000 a year in my life", Isaac E! said in response to his win.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's going to be like now.
Executive producer Kent Weed gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten won't get any rewards despite being the first contestant to complete the track.
The rules say the money belongs to the fastest finisher.
"If more than one competitor takes part in the race, the one with the best time wins", said Weed.
Even if winning the grand prize changed his life, Britten is content with his performance.
I don't think he'd have any grudges.
He's glad he's accomplished what he's accomplished.
He's been warmly received by fans.
He's a great guy and he loves his family.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said, "If there was anyone who could beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think if I won, Isaac would feel the same way.
America Ninja Warrior will continue with the eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers just passed the Minnesota Twins.
For the Detroit Tigers, the second half of the season wasn't exactly a walk in the rose garden.
The Tigers, one of the best baseball teams in the country, are currently in last place in the American League Central Division.
The Tigers just turned their loss away when they beat Minnesota 5-4 in Tuesday's game at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to get closer to the Houston Astros and grab the second wild card in the American League.
Even if it was just for one night, for Detroit it was a return to the Z word, which was so unfathomable to them during the second half of the season.
"Winning is always fun and no matter how", said Tiger manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his offensive lead, and Detroit scored three times in the first two rounds, then took another in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) allowed his opponents 6 1/3 innings and 3 earned runs.
It was only his third lead of his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year with convincing results", Simon said.
It's hard to get into a game when you're often on the bench, and that's why I want to get into the game.
Tiger batsman Victor Martinez hit three times, made two innings and his first extra point since mid-August.
For Martinez, it was his first three-point game since last June, when he hit four home runs against the Seattle Mariners.
"He's been very good at it", Ausmus said.
He looked good in training, fired a lot better and he managed to get it into the game.
Three laps at the end of the seventh turn gave the Twins their best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton won the change with two points on the left side of the field.
Right-handed Aaron Hicks scored a point with the bat set, and Simon was eliminating Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy eliminated his only opponent, Mauer, and had a batter, Miguel San, who shot the ball and ran two yards, leaving right-hander Drew Verhagen behind.
With two players on the meters and a chance for a tie in the second round, VerHagen managed to send the third meter over two meters.
Plouffe has taken 27 wickets over two metres this season and is reigning in the league table.
Detroit held on to the ninth inning, Mauer scored two runs and Bruce Rondon secured a 5-4 lead for the Tigers.
However, this right-hander has knocked San out in three overs.
Detroit took advantage and scored points in a Phil Hughes game.
The Tigers have won three in their first two rounds against a veteran right-hander who entered the game after more than a month's break from back muscle inflammation.
"I never imagined such a start", Hughes said, "but I felt I could throw better in the third shift".
After resisting the first shift of the force, Hughes gave one point to second-meter Ian Kinsler.
Two outs for right-handed J.D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who was the first to circumvent all the targets.
Victor Martinez has broken his series 0-21.
Third-yard Nick Castellanos followed him with a point to the right of the field and scored another run, but Victor Martinez was knocked out when he tried to reach the third goal.
The Tigers added in the second round, when pitcher James McCann and pole-driver Anthony Gose scored two and a half points, and the score was 3-0.
"It got us down on our knees", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit the ball too well, but he got it in the right place.
Hughes, who won by the toss, finished third on the scoreline and was replaced by right-hander A.J. Achter.
Hughes ran three miles, got six shots and four strikes.
NOTE: Aníbal Sanchez, the Tigers' right-handed pitcher, ended the game with a pain in his right shoulder.
He's being cared for by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on the injured list for a sprained shoulder since mid-August, should be making his debut Wednesday.
Sanchez will be replaced by left-handed Daniel Norris, who returns from injury and will play against the Twins.
Since June 30, when Norris was replaced by left-handed pitcher David Price, he's been 1-1 after four games.
But he hasn't played since August 20th because of a tight muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will play their third game at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris is up for a 2-2 ERA by Minnesota left-hander Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for opening up the economy to the wider world
It is necessary to open up the economy to the wider world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told the group, whose task is to reform governance on Tuesday.
"China should engage in attracting foreign investment and expertise and improve open policies", he said of the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the Deepening of Overall Reform.
Promoting openness in the emerging reforms will add new impetus and vitality, as well as provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of regulatory market access, the relaxation of border control policies, the support to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to absorb private capital and the reorganisation of the registration system of residents.
The statement states that a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and enterprises that are outside the investment ceilings.
This system will be progressively tested and improved through test programmes.
This step is significant because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also release controls on the powers it delegates to companies and make sure that companies themselves decide how to run their business.
The statement also states that China will enable border regions to discover new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to support regional growth.
In an effort to open up the state-controlled sector, more areas will be opened up for private investment.
"The Government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with better services", the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or a green card, thanks to the optimisation of requirements and simplification of the application process.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers to practice and develop professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and the CEOs Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
A new bedroom may be established in the Karlovy Vary region.
According to the Deputy Head of the Karlovy Vary Region, Jakub Panick (ČSSD), the current capacity of the bed departments of two regional hospitals and two private hospitals in the region is sufficient and partial adjustments should be made on the basis of an agreement between the departments of the individual hospitals.
But there are also opportunities to expand care in the region.
For example, a day surgery center could be established in the surgical department, where, according to the design, surgical procedures that do not require hospitalization for more than 24 hours would be performed.
The specific hospitals where one-day surgery should be done are not yet clear.
In the leather department of Karlovy Vary Hospital, a laser centre could be set up with the possibility of using laser technology for skin diseases.
Concepcion also recommended the creation of an Appalachian Center to care for patients with brain impairment who are in a vegetative state.
Such a centre should be centrally established and should be an integral part of the anaesthetic-resuscitation unit.
There is also the possibility of concentrating such a facility in an Island hospital where similar care already exists.
Another bed capacity which appears to be insufficient in the Karlovy Vary region is the follow-up beds, in particular the LDN beds, which are insufficient in Nejdk and should be closely linked to the acute care beds.
Part of this facility should function as a rehabilitation bed and part as a classic LDN bed, the concept recommends.
As he points out, the beds for follow-up care are missing mainly at Karlovy Vary Hospital.
They could use abandoned buildings after centralization.
Last but not least, there are no social care beds in Karlovy Vary focusing on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
These beds are scarce throughout the republic, so they could be used for other regions as an Alzheimer's center.
The recommendation also calls for hospitals to prepare for the deployment of so-called beds to be used for which European grants will be made available.
"These are beds that will follow the areas of specialized care and will provide space for translating patients after surgery, such as cardiosurgery, neurosurgery, transplantation or other procedures", describes the Regional Concept of Bed Care.
New services could also be offered in the field of psychiatric care.
