Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends across EU/EEA countries and the UK, ensuring that the COVID-19 pandemic is moving quickly in all countries, although stages vary from country to country.
Based on the knowledge gained from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to be prepared for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of an unknown clinical theory of acute pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the novel coronavirus is now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the active ingredient.
Therefore, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection was named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild illness, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization, while 6% develop a severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate for hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is around 4%.
In this survey, we are reviewing trends in COVID-19 incidence in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom (UK) and comparing them with Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
China's trailing COVID-19 is spreading more geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is currently following that country.
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.
In the 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), where 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths were reported from 31 December 2019 to the above date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Accumulated number of COVID-19 cases and accumulated spread
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is only informed about the COVID-19 cases counted in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as country health ministries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, which is updated daily at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare with what was happening in Italy.
We calculated the short 14-day incremental cases of COVID-19 as a proxy for the outbreak of active COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative numbers of cases recorded in each country as of 8:00 AM on 15th March 2020 and compared with Italy's cases for the period 31st January-15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK
Trends in short-lived 14-day upsurges of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed the trend in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to rise around 21 February and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly driven by a rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar upward trend in the number of COVID-19 cases (complementary material).
Figure 2 compares the numbers for Italy with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
It is noteworthy that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already reported comparable total cases to Italy only 3 weeks ago or less.
Our results indicate that the number of known cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in the accumulated cases of COVID-19 indicates that the pandemic is progressing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, have different national public health responses, and countries may have different definitions of cases and different protocols for screening patients that must be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 cases to hospital and/or an intensive care unit are currently available for only 6% and 1% of cases at EU/EEA level respectively (data not shown).
However, these should be systematically collected to complement current surveillance data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010/11 survey of the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, with a bed density of 29.2 beds per 100,000 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal, showed a large discrepancy.
This means that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 people in 2010/11).
With the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK, the modeling scenario for healthcare capacity saturation shows a >90% risk of overcapacity of intensive care beds, as provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid risk assessment for COVID-19.
Since cases are still clustered in EU/EEA countries and some parts of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually provide a specific regional service to the population, it is desirable to have available information on the number of cases and intensive care beds in the regional unit nomenclature for statistics level 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries should prepare themselves for the ongoing community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals and intensive care units and for the increase in COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare and especially intensive care, as happened in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-COV-2 infection is essential, with a shift from containment to mitigation, as if not implemented in time, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity when countries are likely to further increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the strain on healthcare.
Failing to do so, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face an increase in the number of patients requiring intensive care in the next few days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has killed 3,000 people in China and the rest of the world and infected more than 80,000 people, bringing a catastrophe to the human race.
SARS-CoV is similar to its cousin virus, which caused SARS in several thousand people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS but is much more contagious and affects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, tracers and prevention of the disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review will help to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were asked to stay indoors for the entire holiday and for many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); thus, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its associated disease was named CoV disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 due to the virus, of which more than 40,000 patients have been discharged and more than 3,000 patients have died.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""the public's No. 1 enemy"" and probably more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis and treatment, which have sequenced isolated viruses from multiple patients.
The review attempted to summarize the research progress in this new and rapidly developing field.
Whenever possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-induced disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, pandemic in 2012).
We discussed what we know so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as some remaining but pressing questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens in humans, causing about 4 to 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have experienced two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which respectively started a pandemic outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and which soon spread to many other countries with severe symptoms and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, clusters of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported from Wuhan to the China National Health Commission on 31 December 2019.
The sequence of the CoV was revealed seven days later.
The first fatal case in Wuhan was reported on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, healthcare providers were notified of the infection, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed under lockdown and all of its public transportation was shut down.
On 24 January, the first diagnostic study of the disease reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed patients had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, considered the site of origin of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease had already spread to China and some 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
The final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined as the situation is rapidly escalating.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-centered study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented a more updated picture of the pandemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but predominantly in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected people were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread in waves, mainly in and around Hubei.
The average time from COVID-19 outbreak to diagnosis is 5 (2-9) days.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the period of mass transit before China's Spring Festival.
The mortality rate in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the integrated mortality rate among all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subclass of large, enveloped viruses that contain a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four classes or genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
For SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, the wrapping membrane (S) glycoprotein is bound to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidial peptidase 4 (DPP4) and then membrane-bound.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms a genome RNA virion-containing vesicle or glue with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new strain of beta-CoV with over 99.98% genetic identification in 10 sequence-specific samples collected from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the original site of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically much more similar to SARS-CoV than MES-CoV.
Through percussion electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 cells were found in the microscopic part of the human respiratory tract epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor in human SARS-CoV-2 as well as in SARS-CoV.
However, the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to human ACE2 relatively more weakly than SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than does SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 forms a novel small protein encoded by orf3b and may also form proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral disease causation and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or modalities.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in a composite material including the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the open and closed-adapted mixed component was combined as a dimer, and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixed component could bind the two S proteins, which provided evidence for the recognition and transmission of CoVs.
For the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection, B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials.
Main and intermediate supports
It has been reported that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing a phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered natural hosts of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown what intermediate host virus helped cross the species barrier to infect humans and the transmission pathway is yet to be fully elucidated.
Ji and others that presented the snake as a carrier of virus from bats to humans that is involved in homologous recombination of S proteins.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that the long-beaked pangolin, an ant-eating mammal, is a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the CoV  found in pangolins.
However, the 1% difference in the spread of the two genomes is still a big difference; therefore conclusive results are still awaited for strong evidence (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The psycho-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for up to 5 days in a dry environment outside the organism for 48 hours and at temperatures below 20 °C and humidity of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; fatty solvents other than ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, paracetic acid, chloroform and chlorhexidine can effectively inactivate the virus.
Humans in general have a low immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and are therefore at risk of infection with the novel virus.
No detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported at present.
Thus, we can only look at previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4.4).
Typically, after a virus enters a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors. These include C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the release of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit viral transmission and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus to survive the immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joined the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in immunity.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the immune cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell function by inducing T cell death.
The body's immune system, including supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also necessary to fight viral infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from recovered patients inhibit MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hypersensitivity of the immune system produces locally large numbers of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multi-organ paralysis and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a mild onset, is more likely to affect older people with pre-existing conditions and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or whose immune systems are weak are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most cases 3-7 days.
However, studies of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As described above, a very recent study showed that the incubation period of the pathogen based on a population of 8,866 cases was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine period based on the most accurate pathogen incubation period, thus preventing transmission of the virus from infected to asymptomatic people to others.
As a general rule, people who are infected or have been in contact with the virus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Is it necessary to extend the quarantine period to 24 days?
In most cases, fever is the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, drowsiness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, vomiting and nausea.
Some patients experienced dyspnea (difficulty breathing) and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients develop rapidly with acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with symptoms of fever and/or shortness of breath and severe fever should be tested for the virus in the initial diagnosis even if they do not have pulmonary imaging abnormalities.
A demographic survey in late December 2019 found that 98% of the percentage of symptoms were fever, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had dyspnoea and 3% had diarrhea; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Two recent studies reported similar findings in a family cluster and a cluster caused by infection from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 found that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, which is much higher than in COVID-19 patients and is consistent with the higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, it was found that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13) -25%) were the main symptoms, and approximately 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
By 14 February, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%, while the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, SARS had a mortality rate of 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on a demographic survey in June 2012.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above numbers indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more challenging than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Collective disease often starts in the same family or in the same group or from the same vehicle such as a ship at sea.
Often patients have a history of traveling or living in Wuhan or other infected areas or having been in contact with infected persons or patients in the past two weeks of onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that humans can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks, and recovered patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, which sends a warning to extend the quarantine period.
In the initial stages, patients have normal or low endogenous white blood cell counts (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartic aminotransferase levels with lymphocyte count <1 × 109/L and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients with white blood cell count <4 × 109/L.
Some patients had elevated levels of hepatic and muscular enzymes and myoglobin in their blood, and most patients had increased C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sub-expression in their blood.
In critically ill patients, levels of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, increased and lymphocyte counts decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are characterized by bilateral asymmetric shading or opacity of frosted glass in the lungs.
Patients often have asymptomatic pneumonia, severe lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid retention and progressive fibrosis severely compromise the gas exchange.
Abnormal activity of type-I and type-II pneumocytes decreases surfactant levels and increases surface tension, resulting in decreased lung expansion capacity and an increased risk of lung weakness.
So, the worst kind of chest radiography examinations are often seen in the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, a pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte discharge, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multi-nucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of people who died from the disease, consistent with viral infection and the pathology of ARDS, and similar in SARS and MERS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA identification by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the extremely high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, from 13 February 2020, in China, clinical or diagnostic expressions began to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation has been seen in the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the linkage of disease history, diagnostic screening, laboratory testing and radiological examination is essential and mandatory for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol to use the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to determine SARS-CoV-2, which isolates synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using Dipstick in less than one hour without the need for expanded equipment.
It is hoped that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and reliability when testing diagnostic samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians may provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients while trying different therapies previously used or recommended for the treatment of other CoV-types such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2.2).
The therapy includes antiviral drugs, suppression of immune response, steroids, plasma in recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support in current and potential treatments.
It was even suggested to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily initially attacks the lungs and also probably to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Still, respiratory failure and paralysis are the main threats and the main cause of death in patients.
Thus, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-surgical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation that may be used depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), an advanced cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat fatal cardiac or respiratory failure.
It is also essential to maintain electrolyte balance, prevent and treat indirect infection and septic shock, and protect the function of vital organs in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been reported that it results from cytokine disruption from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine catastrophe is a form of tissue-related inflammatory response that occurs through the release of classes of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines pass through immune cells and release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Suppression of the immune response is essential in the treatment of cytokine disorders, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosylisumab, which is an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine disorders.
Other immune response suppressive therapies for cytokine disruption include modification of the T cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; inhibition of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
To reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants in the treatment of SARS.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, dramatically affecting the chances of recovery.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended to be used with caution for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, including its nucleotide analogue, has been shown to be effective in one US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug, initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential immunity to other single-stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly anticipated.
Baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction of this therapy with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Production of plasma and antibodies from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from infectious diseases to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from falling prey to the disease.
In fact, patients who recover often have relatively high levels of antibodies in their blood in terms of pathogens.
Antibodies are a type of immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight germs and other foreign bodies and they identify specific molecules of pathogens and directly mitigate them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, and with it, inflammation and viral load decreased and blood oxygen saturation improved.
However, specific therapies have not yet been developed and verification and clarification is needed to propose approaches for mass use before that.
Also, in terms of therapeutic effect, some of the disadvantages associated with plasmas should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially fatal toxicity.
Blood levels of antibodies are generally low, and there is a huge demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients.
Developing and manufacturing antibodies quickly in a certain stage is difficult to fight a global pandemic.
Thus, it is more important and fruitful to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes to monitor for effective antibodies against the necessary proteins of the virus or to encode effective antibodies.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effects are largely dependent on the combination of multiple components in a formula which varies depending on the diagnosis based on TCM-theory.
Most of the active ingredients are unknown or unclear, as such ingredients or their optimal combinations are difficult to extract and verify.
Currently, in the absence of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients returning from severe stages.
For example, it was reported that the Shu Feng Jie Du capsule and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule were effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates were reported in several Chinese states, where TCM was used in 87% of COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while the lowest recovery rate (13%) was in Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only 30% of COVID-19 patients.
However, this is a rather crude comparison because many other influencing factors such as the number of patients and the severity should be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing WM and TCM combined with Western medicine (WM) treatments.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, symptoms to resolve, and hospitalization was significantly less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most interestingly, the rate of acute deterioration (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%), and the death rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM await more controlled trials on a larger scale and in more centers.
It would also be interesting to identify the mechanism of action and, if possible, clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or combinations thereof.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 experience extreme levels of highly contagious and even life-threatening illness, and those in quarantine experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, coughing and adverse medical effects such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to further anxiety and stress.
During the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a variety of psychiatric symptoms were reported, including long-term depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
As part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, mandatory contact tracing and quarantine may cause people more concern and guilt about the impact of infection, quarantine and stigmatization of their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons who have been in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Mental health support should include the formation of mental health teams from multiple branches of clinical science, clear communication including regular and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are necessary to prevent the chain of transmission of animal aquaria and susceptible livestock from infected humans, and often complement antiviral therapy to control the epidemic caused by emerging viruses.
Attempts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-lasting and robust resistant antibodies and/or to develop protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been tested in animal models of SARS.
However, the bioavailability of these vaccine candidates in the elderly and in a animal-challenged model and their protection against viral infection in humans from animal sources has yet to be determined before a clinical study can be initiated.
This is likely because SARS was eradicated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, scattered cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of a zoonotic source in the affected region.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people who are not immune is an urgent and important task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, this difficulty is challenging to overcome due to the long time required for vaccine development (average 18 months) and the dynamic mutation of CoV-types.
As a novel disease, the full diagnostic course of COVID-19 has only just begun to be fully developed for thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients with no previous history of disease can recover gradually.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a much higher morbidity and mortality rate in patients with severe infections.
Therefore, it is imperative for health-care agencies to develop a predictive model of the disease to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the disease course indicators in COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the outcome of SARS, which was also true for COVID-19.
In the above mentioned 8,866 case study, 47.7% of the patients were above 50 years of age, with COVID-19 predominantly occurring in the age group of 30-65 years.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have other underlying conditions and complications at the same time, and were significantly older than the others (66 years median age vs 51 years median age), which indicates age as a determining factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in males was higher than in females (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Multiple disease and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer severe cardiac trauma and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, resulting in poor liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It should be remembered that age and underlying disease are strongly related and can interfere with each other.
Unusual laboratory data: C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in blood reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and have been proposed as a predictor of disease progression, response to therapy, and potential for ultimate recovery.
The correlation between the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 with the CRP level was also suggested.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during cell culture damage.
So, these are the traditional markers for heart or liver failure.
Major diagnostic symptoms: The chest radiography and the timing of the diagnostic symptoms along with other problems should be considered for predicting the severity and outcome of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressants as adjunctive therapy in infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were used at a high rate among severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with long-term disability and a lower quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for short durations in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As described above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic often endured prolonged quarantine and extreme uncertainty and were subject to unusual stress as they witnessed the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 appear to be different from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively replicate in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, similar to other CoVs responsible for the common cold.
Thus, patients infected in the early stages or during the onset of the disease can produce large amounts of virus during the course of their daily work, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was considered to occur when patients became seriously ill, when most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the SARS outbreak and is also harder to control.
China is currently undergoing a massive effort, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have taken a dramatic toll on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a slowing of the pandemic.
The most optimistic assumption is that the outbreak will end by March and the downward phase of the disease will last for 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others predicted that COVID-19, which is proving to be significantly more infectious than SARS, would not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini and others established a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was identified in both mid-turbinate and throat larvae from patients recovering and discharged from hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus would become cyclical in a manner similar to influenza.
However, there are hopeful signs in China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicates that the current strategies may have worked.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would cause one million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become weak in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or a relatively less infectious virus in coexistence with humans.
The comparison of SARS and MERS with the COVID-19 pandemic is shown below (Figure (Figure 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and also possibly through direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus was also found in feces, which highlights the new possibility of fecal-to-oral infection.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were likely due to nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections, including 17 patients with other pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers.
Thus, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even those who are in the vicinity of patients or infected people, must take precautions to protect themselves.
Wearing masks can be used as the first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent small droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being dispersed through the air or stuck on the surface of an object, from where they could be spread to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against respiratory exposure of viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through the insides of five consecutive surgical masks, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients should wear N95 (series# 1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear appropriate isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
The virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus probably entered his body through his inflamed eye.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face coverings or goggles when working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly advised that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more frequently than usual, try to stay indoors to quarantine themselves, and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet is considered to be adequate for people to stay away from a patient.
This is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 was introduced to the human world as a new virus, China should have taken high caution based on the deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak due to its high similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020.
However, until January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control had reassured citizens that the novel virus is less contagious and has limited human-to-human reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and controlling the disease.
The message significantly eased public fears, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the crucial time to contain the disease in Wuhan was at a minimum.
Chinese disease control agencies can take this harsh lesson and make the necessary improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies must (1) exercise greater caution when making public announcements as every word will be considered by citizens and this may change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unwanted information received from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more controllable in suppressing a potential pandemic at an early stage instead of trying to console the public; and (4) impose targeted and effective practices often aimed at raising public awareness of the epidemic and periodically testing and improving the response mechanisms of society.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and the severity and mortality rates are also higher in older people than young people.
The death rate from SARS is higher than that from COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus asymptomatically, whereas SARS patients typically do so in severe illness, making it much more difficult to suppress COVID-19 infection than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 has spread more rapidly and more extensively than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may test positive for the virus again.
The discoveries dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important issues remain to be resolved:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal intermediate species was the original host, such as bats, to transmit the virus to humans?
Without knowing the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively contain the spread of infection and the outbreak could return at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cells of the right respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-receptor cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to this question, we will not be able to get quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How does the virus genetically multiply during transmission in humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, a death like SARS, or a temporary flu-like re-emergence?
It is essential, but it will take some time to find answers to these and many other questions.
But whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the coin over to show how devastating and deadly HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in mid-to-late 2019 in China has brought CoVs back to the forefront of the discussion and has surprised us by showing a higher transmissibility and lower pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-borne disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs may help us.
Most HCoVs have originated from bats where they are less pathogenic.
Some HCoV-families have been known to host intermediate hosts.
Animal detection has a direct impact on human immunity.
Investigating CoV-host exchange in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on their discovery history as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecific transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current COVID-19 pandemic was discussed in this context.
Also, the need for successful host transitions and the effects of viral evolution on the severity of the disease are also noted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of enveloped, positively-sensitized, single-stranded RNA viruses.
"Hosting the largest genome of any RNA virus at 26 to 32 kilobases, these viruses were dubbed ""CoVs"" due to their crown-like structures under the electron microscope".
Structurally, the CoV-cluster has an integral genome that is of the same organization.
About two-thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the replicase polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are processed to produce 16 additional non-structural proteins, which have been named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including the alkyl (S), the envelope (E), the membrane (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
Some lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV genome containing most HCoVs, and further divided into four genera (A, B, C and D).
Ethnocentric evidence has shown that bats and mice serve as the gene source for most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main host for gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species barrier and emerged as some of the major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoV-types) have been identified.
Among these, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing acute respiratory tract infection in relatively high-risk patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a high probability of expansion beyond the lungs.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was collected in the mid-1960s from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold.
Since then, more knowledge has been gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, the idea was widely accepted that HCoVs are normally infectious.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting 8,000 people and with an unprecedented death rate of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) continued to spread across the Arabian Peninsula and dispersed to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of 3 March 2020.
Alarm bells are ringing and the world must prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
Each of the seven HCoV-families has an animal origin from bats, rats, or domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses are well adapted and show non-pathogenic but excellent genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented enormous medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
The search for the animal origin of HCoV-families provides a framework for understanding the reasons for natural history, driving forces and limitations of species-to-species (species jumping).
It can guide or direct the search for the base, intermediate and amplifier animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 along with important implications for preventing future spillovers.
In this review, we present a summary of the animal origin, inter-species transmission and pathogenicity of HCoV-families.
In particular, we would like to draw attention to this general context and discuss how the parental viruses of the HCoV-family are normally pathogenic in their natural hosts but become pathogenic after entering the body of a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoV where pathogenicity often declines as transmissibility increases.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Various CoV-contains were collected from various infected animals including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs before the first collection of B814 of the HCoV-229E strain from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold.
In the past decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Common cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, feeling sick, and sore throat were seen in patients infected with HCoV-229E, and fever and cough were seen in 10 to 20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was recovered from organ culture and subsequently from the recurrent growth of the virus in the brains of mammalian rats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which cannot be symptomatically distinguished from infections with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and are mainly transmitted in winter climates during the monsoon season.
Typically, the incubation period of both viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
A study of human volunteers found that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Severe lower respiratory tract infections were seen only in some immuno-compromised patients.
" SARS, also known as ""atypical pneumonia"", was the first documented HCoV-related pandemic in human history and its causative agent was SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCoV".
The first case of SARS was found in Guangdong province, China in late 2002.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 cases reported across multiple countries and continents, including 774 deaths.
In addition to super-spreaders, it was estimated that each case with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and with the onset of the disease on the 10th day would increase the number of secondary cases by about two as well as show the final signs of viral load.
In patients with SARS-CoV, there are initially muscle pain, headache, fever, discomfort and after a cold, shortness of breath, cough and wheezing as delayed symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function tests, and increased creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Loss of dispersed alveolar, proliferation of subcellular and macrophage growth were also observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation at a later stage.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can be infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by cytokine disruption which can be fatal especially in patients with immune system disorders.
The virus was first collected from the open lung biopsy of a relative of a cluster patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was collected from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially prevalent in young children, the elderly and in respiratory illness patients with compromised immune systems.
Common illnesses caused by HCoV-NL63 include chorea, eye inflammation, fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the collection of the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is widespread worldwide.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 is identified as causing approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and most cases occur in summer, spring and early winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was collected from a 71-year-old man in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to group-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute asthma.
HCoV-HKU1, similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, has been found worldwide, causing respiratory illness.
All four of these groups-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally unlikely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic disease, although there were accidents of unknown cause, such as the rare case of the highly virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63 that has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs have acquired the ability to effectively transmit and maintain themselves in humans, they also become relatively less harmful or infectious.
In 2012, MERS-CoV was first collected from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had acute pneumonia and respiratory failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases have originated in the Middle East, out-of-state cases have been reported in various European countries and Tunisia, with occasional secondary outbreaks in close contacts.
Another phase II outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
Characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, the diagnostic manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which is unique to MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of stomach disorders such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed cases with a mortality rate of more than 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses for the human body.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients were identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China as cases sequentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 as a public health emergency of international concern and named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
Notably, the fatality rate in Hubei in China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which present as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% are very similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 due to high nucleotide sequence homology, they cluster in different branches of the ethnogenic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be relatively less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported and may play a role in its rapid spread around the world.
Comparisons and comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, the incubation period of the pathogen and the duration of the course of the HCoV disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is mediated by the spread of SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) that infect the population.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are commonly seen during community-acquired HCoV-infections, including non-specific, mild or even asymptomatic presentations.
On the other hand, a small fraction of severe cases of COVID-19 also exhibited symptoms of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat lower.
Third, the SARS-CoV-2 infection family exhibits interesting characteristic patterns of both acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the family-acquired HCoV-s.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether SARS-CoV-2 is less transmissible after transmission to humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Future studies are yet to clarify whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in at least some cases, such as SARS-CoV-2.
It is of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 exhibits seasonal dependence as does the community-acquired HCoV-class.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission in humans will be dominant in the ultimate outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four strains of mild symptom-causing acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be the progeny of the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoV-types that cause severe disease in humans and those that develop severe HCoV disease in humans have been isolated.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient numbers to accumulate adaptive mutations that fight against host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop its transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four strains of the acquired CoV have spread in the human population, and have caused the onset of common cold and cough in patients with normal immune systems.
These viruses do not require an animal source.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and cannot sustain transmission to humans.
They need to be maintained and propagated in their zoonotic bases and possibly seek opportunities to spread to viable human targets through one or more intermediate and amplifying poses.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics that are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least so far, it is highly contagious like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than the group-acquired HCoV-CoV and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and continue to spread among humans without a host or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, basal, intermediate and mutagenic hosts of HCoVs.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host for HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor by sharing superior homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well to the host and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, an Aadhaar host provides HCoVs with continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host prior to or just in its vicinity of human exposure, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can act as a biological source of human infection and serve as an amplifying host to replicate the virus temporarily and then spread it to humans, thereby increasing the rate of human infection.
If HCoVs cannot continue transmission between intermediate hosts, the transmission rate may be arrested.
Conversely, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate hosts and initiate long-term outbreaks.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the host of the natural host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS indicator event had a history of contact with the animal of the hunt.
Subsequent seroprevalence findings indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG in animal traders than in the general population.
A raccoon dog at the Gundogokull (Pyguma larvata) and live animal markets was first identified as carrying a SARS-CoV-like virus that was nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further cases of SARS were reported after the killing of all the stink bugs in the markets.
However, it was reported that masked palm civets from wild or farms without exposure to the live animal market were essentially negative for SARS CoV, indicating that masked palm civets would only act as intermediate enlargement hosts but not as a natural host for SARS-CoV.
Significantly, as 80% of the Guangzhou market contains animal-derived anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also act as intermediate enlarging hosts for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
These are all thought to be one-way carriers of SARS-CoV.
Further investigation of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-associated rhinoceros bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese Horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibody and for the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have provided the basis for the new idea that bats provide a sanctuary for emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none can be collected as a live virus except for one designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV .
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for entry into cells.
Interestingly, the serums of recovering SARS patients were able to inactivate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is a high degree of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 SARS-CoV is not the immediate parental virus and bats are not the immediate ancestral hosts of SARS-CoV.
Philagenetic analyses classify MERS-CoV in the same class as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to gain entry into the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to replicas of bat beta-CoVs identified from Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the immediate hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single-capped camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific attenuating antibodies, just like camels of Middle Eastern origin in multiple African countries.
The active MERS-CoV similar to the virus found in humans was collected from the nasal swab of a camel, which further indicates that camels serve as the true host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have been shown to exhibit high viral shedding (virus shedding) despite generally having mild symptoms.
Significantly, infected camels spread the virus not only through respiratory tract but also through the rectal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS had no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possibly involving human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
Bat CoV RaTG13 collected from Rhynolophus affinis bats has a 96.2% similarity to the nucleotide homology of SARS-CoV-2.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to determine a parental relationship.
This means that bats may not be the direct ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 unless a near-identical bat CoV is found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife sold and killed at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many early cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as the bony parrot (Manis javanica) may also carry ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The nucleotide sequence homology of these novel coronavirus genomes is 85-92% similar to that of SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally associated with RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They cluster in the gene tree two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses, one of which shares a similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although with a higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
An earlier study on ill Bonruai also reported the detection of a continuous sequence of the virus from lung samples, which has been shown to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study adopted various assembly methods and manual presentations to produce partial genome sequences with approximately 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to sequence isolation between SARS-CoV-2 and the related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs, there is currently no evidence to support a direct BONRUI origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the related beta-CoV-clusters of Bonruei SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is not yet established.
While most sequence homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and Bonrouye's RBDs, the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-families, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, share most genome-specific sequence homology.
It is highly hypothesized that the high similarity between the RBD-related beta-CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated evolutionary drift.
A counterproposal is for a third wildlife species to be recombined between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a forest.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among the beta-CoVs.
The direct animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal sources of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Philagenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E originated from bat CoVs, although parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rats.
A bat CoV, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian ridge CoV), identified in North American trilobate bats has been reported to exhibit close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, was genetically related to another bat CoV, Hipposideros/Ghanacovaum/19/2008, although the comellids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the animal sources of known HCoV-families are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2 of the current knowledge.
Ethnic analysis has provided evidence of inter-species transmission events of CoVs in history.
An outbreak of respiratory illness occurred around 1890 when HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
One of them is an alpaca-alpha CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, the shared ecological environment may be due to the contact of bats with humans but not with alpacas.
Instead, the alpaca has a close human contact.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated bat alpha-CoVs are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoVs cause outbreaks of respiratory illness in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wildlife.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas receive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not very surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool for HCoV-229E, but alpacas and one-horned camels can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus in humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of the transmission of interspecies infection from bats to a camel and from a camel to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at the initial identification and further confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bats provide a rich base of viral species for the interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Long life, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong flight skills are the conditions for bats to be ideal 'virus spreaders'.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, was exposed to a camel with a hump decades ago.
It is well adapted to these camels which have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable and natural base host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low transmission rate among these animals.
Its sporadic transmission in humans is an accident and humans remain the last refuge of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be contained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV infection, pangolins are different if they are involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the last refuge for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs similar to the smell-like ones in SARS-CoV.
The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from animals to humans interspecies may need to be included or excluded in future studies.
First, bats may be the host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological niches with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Secondly, bonobos could be one of the intermediate translocation hosts where a SARS-CoV-2 related virus was newly introduced.
People are infected with the virus through the cutting and eating of the meat of predators.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are immune to SARS-CoV-2.
A study in domestic and wild animals has been confirmed for antibodies.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has had contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main causes of viral load are also important in helping CoVs to overcome interspecies barriers.
First, they have a relatively high mutation rate in RNA.
"Compared to other single-stranded (stranded) RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered as ""moderate"" to ""high"" depending on the novelty of the CoV adaptation, and the average replacement rate is ~10-4 replacements per site per year".
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, which results in extreme high variability and vulnerability or even inability to survive.
Of interest, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is known to form CoV copies by inhibition of exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, mutation rates in CoVs are about one million times higher than in their hosts.
Furthermore, the conversion rate is often higher when the CoV-strain does not adapt well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a higher mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate, which indicates a more easily adapted to humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
This is also true for MERS-CoV, which adapts well to a camel with a hump.
In theory, the possibility that genetic drift in SARS-CoV-2 could rapidly render vaccines and antivirals ineffective is extremely unlikely.
Secondly, the large RNA of the CoV utilizes the extra flexibility in genome transcription for genome transcription and recombination, thereby increasing the potential for intersymbol evolution, which is favorable for the emergence of CoV-communities when the conditions are favorable.
It is supported by a number of unique encoded open reading frame and protein functions at the 3′ end of the genome.
"Third, CoVs randomly and often by a unique ""copy-like"" process change the templates while RNA is being replicated".
Strand switching often occurs during CoV RNA replication in the host that acts as the mixing vessel.
RNAs with superior homologous full length and subgenome can recombine to form new CoV-series.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and in animal CoV-families such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interactions related to transmission
In addition to the three viral components described above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies infections.
Among them, the recombination of SARS-CoV was taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection when interspecies transmission occurred.
Based on comparative analysis between the collection of human and coccidial SARS-CoV- populations, SARS-CoV is thought to be able to adapt rapidly to RBD mutation, particularly of S protein, in different hosts.
RBD in the S protein of a CoV typically interacts with cellular receptors and is strongly selected by the response of the host antibody.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is present in the 318th to 510th amino acid in the S1 fragment that binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV's RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors in a variety of animals, including bats, civets, mice, and raccoon dogs, which may cause interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found to be different from the odorless viral isolates in humans and RBD, and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding pattern to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
The Cvet SARS-CoV RBD has K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the likelihood of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the replacement of these two amino acids could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is notable that the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is similar.
The 30% difference between the S1 units of the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV indicates that the tendency of its S protein to bind to human ACE2 may be altered.
In fact, a cryo-EM study suggests a tendency for binding 10 to 20 times higher than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It is also important to determine whether any other co-receptors may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Concerned, HCoV-NL63 is also bound to ACE2 but with a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopoptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be the cause of successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after they have been infected from their animal hosts to the interspecies.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcomes of interspecies infection with HCoV-like strains are also driven by dependence on other hosts and limiting factors.
Splitting of these host proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoV-associated HCoVs such as bats, camels and mice may inhibit interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must take over host dependence factors and destroy host restriction factors for a successful interspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular determinants in this critical area of virus-host exchange have yet to be identified and characterized.
A neutral genome-wide screening of host dependence and restriction for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR may be fruitful.
The rise of novel HCoVs: back to where it all began
The variation of bat CoV-types provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoV-types.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as a gene pool for HCoVs.
Also, rapid mutation and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the ability to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Of the SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were collected but were found to encode the differentiated ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide deletion property of SARS-CoV-CoV has been found in strains collected early in the human epidemic.
This cleavage splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and appears to be an adaptive mutation that encourages shelter switching.
Also, there is a history of possible recombination of SARS-CoV with the alpha- and gamma-CoV-groups, where a large number of small recombination regions were identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recurrence locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the pandemic MERS-CoV passed through a recombination event between different clans, which occurred in a hairy camel in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal CoV-types in genes that are not their constituents.
It should also be cautioned that artificial selection may contribute to unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly as a result of the release of viruses from selection pressures such as the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype formula due to bi-nucleotide removal.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in related bats and camel viruses of HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV appears to be localized within a single nucleotide, resulting in a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selection pressures on their host.
When bats were infected by CoV, they were asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic, indicating mutual adaptation between CoV-like strains and the bats.
Bats have been found to be genetically and physiologically well adapted to the CoV community.
For example, defects in the activation of anti-inflammatory responses in mice effectively reduce the pathology driven by CoVs.
In addition, the activity of the natural killer cell in the bat is suppressed due to the low expression levels of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule.
Furthermore, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the higher metabolic activity of the bat can both suppress CoV's replicants and affect the proofreading by exoribonucleases, thus providing the selective pressure needed to produce the virus strains when exposed to a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also evolve through recombination leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein traits for host adaptation.
Thus, the possibility of three new HCoVs emerging in the last two decades is not coincidental.
Co-Vs cause mild symptoms in non-pathogenic or their host hosts such as bats and camels.
They grow strong without the strong resistance response of the host.
The secret lies in why asymptomatic carriers occur and what causes serious human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to overactivation of the immune response and cytokine storms where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been isolated from the CoV counterpart.
The same tactic of disconnecting the immune response may have a beneficial effect on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in monkeys.
Therefore, type I interferon should be the preferred choice for at least the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
Also, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this reasoning, inhibitors of NLRP3 inflammasomes including MCC950 may be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general principles as those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
On the one hand, a bat beta-CoV was found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, while on the other hand, a bat CoV was found to share 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While commercial parrots and other animals have been reported to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
A curiously homologous Bonroy beta-CoV subfamily has been found with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the Bonroyans may serve as one of the intermediate hosts or that the Bonroyans may contribute the gene pool to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was either intentionally or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have returned to the spotlight again due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoV-families in monkeys and other animals has significantly changed our perception of the importance of animal sources and animal bases of HCoV-families in human infection.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a bat source and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection arises from contact between humans and gander in the market, killing the gander by closing the wet market could have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
By the same logic, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent animal infection in light of the discovery of multiple strains of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, what and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via bats and other mammals is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been present in single-horned camels for a long time.
These camels are important means of transportation and also serve as the main source of meat, milk, leather and fur for the local people.
They are spread across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in the Chinese wild animal market to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a holistic approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
The failure to eliminate these viruses could result in the emergence of new genotypes.
Many animal-based CoVs are found in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs with animal potential are very rare.
These zoonotic CoVs have a high potential to proliferate and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between people and animals.
With the testing of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be a better preparedness and response plan.
Many viruses have been around for a very long time.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have a chance to spread.
Although bats have many characteristics that are conducive to the spread of the virus, the chances of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are made aware to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is required to better understand the CoV community and their natural host ecosystems, which will prove effective in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent zoonotic diseases in humans is to stay away from the ecological niche of the animal virus' natural habitat.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the parental virus of SARS-CoV-2 to bats, it is necessary to see under what circumstances bats and bats may share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats are more directly involved in human infection, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it must be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental transmission should be performed.
If it is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent viruses will be identified in its natural hosts in the future.
Continued findings in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have an important impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the criteria for the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advice guide for the detection and treatment of Novel Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guide provided our experience and made good reference for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
However, as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on the ongoing research findings and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment techniques are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided a completely new diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases, in accordance with the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified, officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advisory guide and it has been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has received a huge response.
Keep in mind that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is also gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued diagnostic and medical guidelines related to COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, a total of seven editions, each with some significant changes in content.
Now that Zhou and his colleagues have commented on our guidelines, they have provided a simple score-setting recommendation based on their clinical experience.
Their work has added new evidence to our guidance and also created valuable references for the global pandemic.
We acknowledge their remarkable work and express our gratitude.
However, their work should also be updated to reflect the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (trial 7th edition) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case, a detailed analysis must have two clinical symptoms with one of the epidemiological historical features, or if there is no clear epidemiological history, three clinical symptoms must be met for this reason.
Epidemiological history: (1) history of living in or traveling to Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (positive to nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city or surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) history of exposure to a small area (or, office, school classroom, etc.) with a fever and respiratory infection occurring within 2 weeks and/or ≥ 2 cases.
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the stage of early onset of the outbreak.
To diagnose a confirmed case based on suspected case, there should be pathogenic or serological evidence of any of the following: (1) positive in the real-time PCR test that detects SARS-CoV-2; (2) high homogeneity or similarity with the known novel coronavirus in the full gene sequencing of the virus; (3) positive in the serum test for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies; or positive in the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies that have changed from negative to positive, and ≥4 times the increase in severity of the serum level of tyranny.
We have found that the second (18th January 2020) and third (22nd January 2020) editions include respiratory nucleic acid detection, real-time PCR test and blood samples.
The pathological detection of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers that rapidly identify a favorable nucleic acid detection kit for the search for blood samples, including respiratory tract samples, which increases the availability of various samples and which helps to bring certain antibody positive results to a definite standard.
Furthermore, there is more and more evidence that reminds us to be careful in patients with and without irregular symptoms.
Therefore, Zhou and colleagues should update the flow list, as they have classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in future clinical practices and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will come and readers will call for their comments.
To diagnose suspected and confirmed cases, we recommend that they be identified and follow the latest guidelines in your country.
Our team will update our guidelines in a timely manner to help.
Bangladesh reported a daily high of five new deaths due to COVID-19.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Institute of Pathology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora said the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two of the cases are over 60 years old, two are between 51 and 60 years old and one is 41-50 years old.
He added that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March.
A hospital official told local news agency Anadolu Agency that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitri Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Highways Obaidul Kader said that public transport would remain shut for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The public transportation shutdown began on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential commodities such as medical, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 infection was reported in Bangladesh on 8 March, between two men returning from Italy and the spouse of one of them.
As of March 19, all three have recovered so far.
Worldwide, the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded one million
The Johns Hopkins University data indicates that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection has exceeded one million worldwide on Thursday.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to the coronavirus, COVID-19.
The milestone comes on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus-related death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the WHO has documented 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the previous 24 hours of 10 am Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, at least 5,900 deaths were recorded, adding up to more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 people in the US died from coronavirus infections on Wednesday, citing Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries announced stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to be paid even if they were not in work by April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted in favor of extending the national emergency for 15 days; the vote passed by 215 votes in favor, ten votes against and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the whole day; the previous curfew was only in effect from 3 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand had planned to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia lowered the limit of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the limit of toilet paper purchases per transaction to two and one packages respectively across all stores nationally.
Also, on Saturday, ALDI introduced the one-pack limit.
These restrictions were posted as messages at checkouts and on the chain's Facebook pages.
Shoppers were reportedly hoarding in fear of COVID-19 if people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited sales of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous transaction-by-pack four-pack limitation that Woolworths and Coles introduced on March 4 and 5 respectively.
On 8 March, Coles announced via its media that the four-packet ban had been introduced in several locations, but that "many stores still sell out within an hour of delivery", calling the demand "unprecedented" and calling it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday to ALDI.
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra was also allowed two packs last week.
To further reduce shortages, Coles orders larger packages from suppliers and increases the rate of supply replenishment, Woolworths orders additional stock, where ALDI makes stock available in advance for a planned special Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions during the trucking period made it difficult.
As suppliers try to meet demand, he expects production costs to rise.
ALDI announced on Tuesday that after previously stocking up, some stores could not conduct Wednesday's special sale.
In a News.com.au report, retail expert Dr Gary Mortimer from the Queensland University of Technology said that stores are stocking up every night.
He commented that toilet paper is a heavy substance, which means that it is in short supply and when it is sold out, the huge shelves are empty and the feeling of shortage is reinforced.
"The Coles and Woolworths view is that if he has a lot of stuff, things like toilet rolls and sanitizer, and it's in sufficient quantities, then maybe that fear will be lessened", Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
Who's Giving a Crap, a producer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that it would run out of stock.
According to a report by News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the makers of the Clintseek toilet tissue and Solaris paper that makes Surbent, insisted that they were working 24/7 to maintain supply.
A real estate site Domain.com reported that some property sellers in Melbourne were giving away free toilet paper to first bidders at auctions, some of which were held because buyers had a long Labor Day weekend.
In this Thursday edition of the NT News, printed daily in Darwin, an eight-page supplement is given for cutting into pieces and used as toilet paper.
A report from ABC Australia on 3 March said that stores were largely reluctant to impose restrictions, saying they had no plans to impose restrictions on their shopping.
Russell Zimmerman also said that other products are in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, sales of Andress toilet paper are limited to two 12-roll packs every Sunday evening at the online British supermarket Okado.
COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, to be an epidemic.
"Although the term ""epidemic"" refers to how widespread a disease has become rather than how dangerous a particular case is, the WHO noted the need for governments to take action:"
"All countries can still change the course of this global pandemic".
"WHO Secretary General Adnanom Ghebreyesus said that if states can identify, " " test, treat, isolate, identify and cluster " " .
"We are deeply concerned about both the alarming levels of disease spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity".
According to Dr. Tom Freuden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published on CNN in February, he said, "Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced continuously from its origin to the world".
Gebrehas shares the same opinion, saying, "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
"He went on to say, ""And we've never seen a global pandemic that can be contained at the same time"."""
The new global pandemic status follows the decision by the WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""The situation is, by the way, going to get worse"."
The Associated Press reported Thursday that the global number of COVID-19 infections is at least 126,000, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Around 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while the global range is from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is usually five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy.Recommended prevention measures include washing hands early, covering the face when coughing, maintaining social distance, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities worldwide have responded with travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and facility closures.
The global pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, with cancellations of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and fearful shopping resulting in further supply shortages.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally across 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asian people, and significantly others from areas where cases of the virus have been found, based on race and appearance.
Due to travel and heavy industry shutdowns, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health authorities in Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to wholesale markets of Hunan seafood and the virus is thought to have an animal source.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronavirus, the Bunnrue coronavirus and SARS-CoV. The first person to be reported as having symptoms was later reported as having fallen ill on 1 December 2019; and subsequently the person had no visible connection to the Wet Market cluster.
The market was found to be associated with two-thirds of the initial cluster of cases in December 2019.
An unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post on 13 March 2020 indicated that a case found to be the first on 17 November 2019 may have been the first, which occurred in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new infections in China had allegedly decreased, but had suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases outside China had for the first time overtaken the number of new cases inside China.
Cases may have been underestimated, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, mostly under the age of 19, and 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, Chief Scientific Adviser of the United Kingdom, estimates that 60% of the British population needs to be infected before the active population acquires immunity.
According to official protocol, a case is the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, had formalised policies not to test only those with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that as of 23 January, about 86% of COVID-19 infections in China had gone undetected, and that these unreported infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was significantly higher than the official figure.
Initial estimates of the general reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4 at the start.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it is likely 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not, the interval between the onset of symptoms and death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common interval being 14 days.
As on 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were reported as COVID-19 related.
In China, 80% of deaths as of February 5 were people over 60 years of age, and 75% of those had pre-existing conditions including heart disease and diabetes.
The number of deaths as a result of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without testing - such as at home, nursing homes, etc.
Some partial data from Italy suggests that the excess death toll during the pandemic has been 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death rate.
"A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know that [the reported death toll] is an estimate below the actual number", a statement backed by reports that the US has no reliable count data. Such underestimation is common in cases of global pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death in Wuhan occurred on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1 and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, more than a dozen deaths have been reported outside of mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, deaths have been reported in more than forty countries and territories on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed since initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health. The ratio of deaths to infections shows the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time frame.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the worldwide death and case ratio was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimated ratio of deaths to cases has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms between 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with first symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other preventive measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from a disease without being diagnosed, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from a disease without being diagnosed (diagnosed or undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case analysis.
Many scholars have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates that the overall mortality rate for the epidemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The calculation of the upper end of this range is consistent with a statistical study of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and the analysis of the test's effect on CFR estimates.
The WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The maximum extent of the outbreak and the final timing are uncertain and may vary by location.
"As the host is removed, infectious outbreaks typically take over and then begin to decay when the disease no longer has a host", said McKeag-Bonnie of Penn State University.
But at the moment it is almost impossible to project any judgment on when that will be.
" Chinese government senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that if all countries were united to follow the WHO's advice to curb the spread of the virus, ""it could be over by June. """
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will probably be around for a year or two".
"According to research led by Neil Ferguson of Imperial College, "physical distancing and other measures are required until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
"William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it is highly unlikely that this coronavirus, because it is so contagious, will disappear completely"" and that it ""could become a seasonal disease, returning every year""".
The severity of the return will depend on the immunity and metabolic rate of the animal.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected individuals may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: breathlessness, production of a breathing foam (cough), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, cold, vomiting, coffee sputum, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, awakening, and blue eyes or lips as urgent symptoms; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present. Further development of the disease can cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of these cases may be asymptomatic with no clinical symptoms, but the test results confirm the infection, so the researchers recommend that people who have been in contact with confirmed infected people should also be monitored and tested to avoid transmission.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic proportion range from a few to 44%.
The range of the general incubation phase (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days; the incubation period is usually five days.For an example of uncertainty, the fraction of people with COVID-19 who initially experienced a smell loss accounted for 30% and those who experienced a smell loss later accounted for 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread primarily by small droplets produced during close contact and when coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact is defined as being between 1 and 2 meters (3 and 6 feet).
The survey found that a single open cough can travel from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some believe the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets of fluid that are formed during speech and remain in the air for long periods of time. Respiratory lacerations can also be produced during breathing, including speech, although the virus is not normally airborne.
Water particles can enter the mouth or nose of people who are nearby, or they can enter the lungs through respiration.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory secretions to become aerosols and consequently spread through the air.
It can also be spread when someone touches any contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Despite concerns that it could spread through feces, this risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of a faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days of symptoms, although it can be transmitted before and after the onset of symptoms.
Many people tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that infection could have occurred before any significant symptoms appeared.
There are only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases, but some countries have detected asymptomatic infections during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was detected in plastic (polypropylene) for three days, 304 stainless steel for one day, cardboard for one day, and copper for four hours.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, just as after touching other surfaces that have been touched by infected humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three pneumonia cases associated with a group of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found in all related coronaviruses found in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap as it breaks the protective membrane of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be the source of a zoonotic disease.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the subgenus Cerbovirus (lineage B) in the genus Betacoronavirus with two strains from bats.
Another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13) had a full genome level of 96% accurate.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that the difference between the virus in Bonrui and the virus in humans is only one amino acid in certain parts of the genome sequence.
A whole-genome comparison to date has found that the Bonruï coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 have a very high 92% genetic similarity, which is insufficient to prove that Bonruï acted as a host in the middle.
While viral infection can be diagnosed temporarily depending on symptoms, it is ultimately confirmed by reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT imaging of infected larvae.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less accurate, and that many of its imaging features are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CT should not be used as a first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test is conducted using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within hours to days.
This test is usually performed on a nasopharyngeal swab, but a throat swab may also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for long-range use.
Serological test developed by Chelex in the United States is approved for emergency use only in approved laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacity and absence of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of images from the tests of confirmed cases.
The PCR has been limited to the identification of COVID-19 without any confirmation for adenovirus and other infections.
A large study in China compared PCR with the results of chest CT and explained that although imaging of this infection is now less specific, it is faster and more sensitive, which suggests that it should be considered as a screening tool in the epidemic-stricken area.
The AI-powered modulation facility has been developed to prepare the virus characteristics through radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, hand washing, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing into tissue and then disposing of the tissue in a trash container.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent infection.Many governments have advised against or restricted all non-essential travel from countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached a mass transmission level in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some people in the community do not know where or how they became infected.It is recommended that healthcare providers who are treating someone who may have been infected use evidence-based warnings, contact precautions and eye protection.It is important for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to locate people who may have been in contact to prevent further infection.
The use of mobile phone location data by the administration for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 organizations issued statements calling for limitations on such surveillance.
A number of mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert teams are working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to others' mobile phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have come in contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive.There are many misconceptions about how to prevent infection, such as rinsing the inside of the nose and gargling with mouthwash.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although several companies are working to develop one.
Hand washing was recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water occasionally for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; before blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Because outside the human body, the virus can be killed by using household soap, which bursts the virus's protective bubble.
The CDC recommends that when soap and water are not readily available, a sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol should be used instead.
WHO advised people not to touch their eyes, nose or mouth with unclean hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with a few solutions (within one minute of contact with the disinfectant in the case of stainless steel surfaces), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorexidein gluconate are comparatively less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in an office or daycare setting, offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people fold their mouth and nose elbows or cover with tissue paper when coughing or sneezing and dispose of the tissue properly immediately.
People who are at risk of infection are advised to wear surgical masks. Wearing a mask can control the amount and spread of water particles released when speaking, sneezing or coughing.
WHO has issued a guideline on when and how to wear a mask.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the tendency to touch people's faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene. " Mask use is also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected".
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have started encouraging people to wear face masks.
In the US, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical face masks made of cloth.China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when approaching other individuals at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or less.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask while travelling on public transport or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to make face masks at home and wash their clothes.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a face mask when entering public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that a face mask be worn by every grocery store entrant.
Israel has asked all its citizens to wear face masks whenever they go out.
Taiwan, which has been producing about 10 million masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and interstate buses to wear face masks for travel on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask when going out and recommended that those who cannot afford to buy a face mask wear a homemade face mask.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes reducing close contact between individuals and slowing the spread of disease to control the spread of infection.
Methods include: quarantining; restricting travel; closing schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can practice social distancing methods from home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, greeting without touching and maintaining physical distance from each other.
Many governments are now mandating or advising social distancing in areas affected by outbreaks.
The maximum size of the gathering, as recommended by US government authorities and health organizations, rapidly decreased from 250 people (unless COVID-19 was known to be spreading in the area) to 50 and then to 10 people.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and people with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and impaired immunity are at increased risk of serious illness and complications, and the CDC advised that they stay at home as much as possible in areas of community outbreaks. Towards the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began replacing the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", explaining that the goal of social distancing is to maintain physical contact while maintaining virtual distance or social distance from a physical contact".
"The use of the term "social distancing" has affected people in a way that has led to complete social isolation rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health for use during the pandemic".
This included advising you to only have sex with someone who lives with you, who is free of the virus or has no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those infected with COVID-19 and those who suspect they may have it.
Health agencies issue detailed guidelines for appropriate self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all residents living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with any person infected with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with high infection rates are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible contact.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment and eradication.
Suppression measures are taken in the early stages of the outbreak, and other measures to control infection are aimed at initiating and vaccinating, in addition to finding and isolating infected people to stop the spread of the disease in the remaining population.
When there is no longer any way to contain the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on healthcare systems and society.
At the same time, a mixed standard of both containment and mitigation may be required.
More extreme measures of containment are needed to reverse the epidemic cycle by reducing the number of initial reproductions from 1 to 1. Reducing the maximum limit of a pandemic is part of the management of an outbreak of an infectious disease, known as the curve-flattening of a pandemic.
This reduces the risk to healthcare by being discovered and gives more time for diagnosis and treatment to improve.
Other ways to control the outbreak other than medication include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantining; public social measures aimed at maintaining physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; recognizing other such means and involving the public to participate in them; and environmental measures, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also adopted a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea initiated mass testing and locally quarantines, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support to those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and increased the penalties for fraud in medical supplies.The efforts of Great Britain and the United States demonstrate that mitigation (slowing down but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (increasing the response to the epidemic) are a major challenge.
While the most ambitious eradication policies have reduced the maximum demand for healthcare by two-thirds and deaths by half, health systems are still overwhelmed with millions of deaths.
Suppression may be the preferred option but it is necessary to maintain it for as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as measures are relaxed otherwise the virus can return quickly.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic are causing social and economic damage.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to test and develop existing drugs.
Over the counter cough and cold medication, fluid intake and rest may help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the illness, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required.
Steroid use can have worse outcomes.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and home remedies" help alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and the acquisition of healthcare facilities for COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a preventive measure to contain the outbreak of the disease in the first place.
ECDC and WHO European Regional Office have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary care delivery centres that require the removal of multiple sources and that include increasing laboratory focus towards testing for COVID-19, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 positive patients and training staff to increase the number of intensive care units and the number of available ventilation and beds, etc.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was found on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased within a month.
Most of them were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from one such animal; in other words, it has an animal origin.A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a 'SARS-like coronavirus'".
Eight of the doctors, including Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Lee Eiphen, was harassed by his senior staff for revealing the danger.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
In early January, several cases of unidentified pneumonia were reported in Wuhan that are under investigation.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled to about one every seven and a half days.
During early and mid-2020s, the virus spread to other parts of China, aided by Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transportation hub and major rail junction.
On 20 January, China stated that about 140 new cases were found in a day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data showed that as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people were already showing symptoms. As of 26 March, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There has been at least one case of infection in about 200 countries and territories.

"After these notices were published, the police warned Wuhan doctors to 'spread rumours' about the outbreak".
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no ""clear evidence"" of human-to-human transmission".
" In late January, the Chinese government launched a revolutionary campaign that was later described by the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, as a ""people's war"" to control the spread of the virus".
"A cordon sanitaire was declared on January 23 to stop travel to and from Wuhan, which was described as ""the largest quarantine in human history"" that was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei and affected an estimated 57 million people in total".
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
The Chinese New Year celebration (25 January) has been cancelled in several places.

For example, Beijing has declared a 14-day quarantine mandatory for all international travellers entering the city.Only one case was detected domestically in mainland China five days earlier on 23 March, in a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said that the spread of domestically infected cases had been largely contained and the outbreak in China was controlled.
Two months after the lockdown was imposed, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei on the same day, except for Wuhan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, and no specifics were given as to when the policy would end.

Screening methods include self-reporting of symptoms in new international arrivals via mobile app, drive-through testing of the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity at the rate of 20,000 people tested daily.
South Korea's program to contain the outbreak has been considered a success, despite not quarantining cities completely.
Many Koreans have signed petitions either claiming the outbreak was officially abused and calling for Moon's punishment or praising his response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest number of one-day cases in a total of four weeks.

A CNN report suggests that a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test as many people as have the virus to date may be leading to a high mortality rate.
The UK initially had the most relaxed response to the virus among affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020 the British administration had not imposed any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government has been criticised for failing to recognise the prevalence and seriousness of the impact that the disease can have on people.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a proclamation banning all non-essential travel, social gatherings and advising people to work from home where possible and to avoid pubs, restaurants and nightclubs.

On 28 January 2020, the US government's main public health agency, the Center for Disease Control, announced that they had developed their own testing kits.
Nevertheless, the United States has been very slow to test, which has resulted in the actual infection rate being reduced during the outbreak.
The test was hampered by the lack of state approval for the defective test kits produced by the state government in February and the private test kits (educational institutions, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and the controlled qualification of people to qualify for a test until early March (after which a doctor's order was required).
By February 27, The Washington Post reported that there were fewer than 4,000 tests in the United States.

On 23 January, WHO Representative Geden Gally commented on the decision of central authorities to implement the transport ban in Wuhan, stating that "WHO has certainly taken this recommendation", and that it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the global pandemic in the place where it is most concentrated", and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health". On 30 January, after confirmed human-to-human infections outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth since swine flu was first declared a global pandemic in 2009.
The WHO Director-General said that PHEIC was due to the fact that "the risk of global spread is higher in low- and middle-income countries with poor health systems".
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for such measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and business" and added that "WHO does not recommend restricting business and movement".

"On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "agreed to hand over the powers of the entire UN system in response".
"The result was the activation of a UN crisis management team, which allowed the entire United Nations to coordinate the response, which, according to WHO, would allow them to "focus on the health response, and other agencies to leverage their expertise to deal with the broader social, economic and developmental impacts of the outbreak".
On 14 February, the WHO-led Joint Task Force with China was activated to bring international and WHO expert teams to China to help with domestic management and to assess the severity and transmission of the disease through workshops and meetings with various key national institutions and to travel to appropriate locations to assess the impact and response of activities at provincial and county levels, including urban and rural settings.On 25 February, the WHO announced that the country should have been better prepared for this potential coronavirus pandemic and said that while it was not considered a pandemic, countries should have been at the level of preparedness at the time.

Mike Ryan, WHO's executive director for health emergencies, warned in a statement that "this is a real test for every government on earth: wake up".
"The virus may be close by and you need to be prepared", the right response could help the world avoid "the worst of it".
Ryan went on to say that the current data does not provide the evidence needed for public health officials to declare it a global pandemic, and said that such a declaration would mean "we have necessarily accepted that every person in the world will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The Managing Director said that WHO "is deeply concerned about the alarming spread and prevalence of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.WHO has faced considerable criticism for its inadequate response to the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic".

Several provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were fired for attempting to isolate people in central China, clearly reflecting the dissatisfaction with political organizations that have been focusing on the outbreak in these regions.
Some critics believe that the move was made to protect Xi Jinping, the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have denied a previous admission that COVID-19 conspiracy theories originated in the United States or Italy, where the coronavirus outbreak first began in Wuhan.
" Donald Trump's US administration has referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"" in response to China's ""censorship that supercharged a virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which some critics have criticized as racist and as an attempt to distract from his administration's "failure to prevent the disease".
"The Daily Beast reported on the US government's conduct that outlined a strategy of communicating with sources at the National Security Council, where the strategy was quoted as being "all about China".

"This is certainly not a good sign for European unity".
On March 22, after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged for the Russian military to send military medics, special disinfectant vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
An anonymous "high-level political source" quoted in the Italian newspaper La Stampa said that 80 percent of the Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
"The source accused Russia of embarking on a campaign to please it "geopolitically and diplomatically".
Attilio Fontana, president of Lombardy, and Luigi Di Maio, Italian foreign minister, rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the US.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "when it comes to helping US colleagues, [Putin] thinks that when US medical device manufacturers get some momentum, they can reciprocate".
"The Defender 2020 NATO military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, which is NATO's largest since the end of the Cold War, will be held on a reduced scale".
"Kate Hudson, general secretary of The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, criticised Defender 2020 exercise: ""In the current public-health crisis, it will not only endanger the livelihoods of the participating forces from the US and many other European countries, but also the lives of the residents of the countries they control"."The government of Iran has been severely affected by the virus, with two members of parliament infected as well as dozens of other current or former political figures".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote an open letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying that the US sanctions against Iran are making it difficult for his country to fight the outbreak due to its limited access to international markets.The outbreak has led the US to adopt common social policies such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of funding for public health, as well as other countries in the region.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect the chances of Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated during the global pandemic.
"After Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-designated location, South Korea criticized Japan's ""ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts""".
South Korean society was initially polarised over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed a petition calling for Moon's dismissal, claiming that the government had mishandled the outbreak, while others signed a petition praising his response. The global pandemic has prompted many countries to enact emergency laws in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow the government to further entrench its hold on power.
In Hungary, its parliament has given Prime Minister Viktor Orban the power to rule by decree for an indefinite period, suspend parliament or rig elections, and punish dignitaries who spread misinformation about how the disease is transmitted and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak is blamed for supply shortages, a global increase in the use of materials needed to fight the pandemic, panic and disruption of factories and logistics.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of drugs and medical supplies due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Shopping was also panicked in several areas, with people buying more essential grocery items such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing shortages in the area.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in the shipment of electrical goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has raised prices twenty times the normal price and delayed the supply of medical supplies for six months.
This created a global shortage of personal protective equipment, and WHO warned that it would endanger health workers.
The pandemic in Australia has given Daegu merchants a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
The activity led to the unavailability of baby formula in some supermarkets and subsequent bans by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, ensuring an overwhelming demand for food items, both areas have been able to keep themselves free from severe food shortages.
Measures by China and Italy against the stockpiling of essential commodities and illegal trade have been successful, avoiding the severe food shortages that were predicted in North America, not only in Europe.
While there has been no significant decline in agricultural production in northern Italy, industry representatives believe prices could rise.
When Chinese government officials released pork that was being stockpiled in order to provide adequate nutrition to the population, even in Wuhan, they initially faced empty food shelves.
Italy has a similar national law that requires food producers to keep food in stock for such emergencies.
The global economy is also feeling the damage in China: China's economy suffered a severe shock in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to slow the spread of the virus, with retail sales down 20.5%, according to a media report on March 16.
As mainland China plays a key role as a hub of economy and manufacturing, the outbreak threatens to create a major destabilization of the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture is revealed on the likely outcome.
In January 2020, some analysts predicted that the economic disaster caused by the pandemic in global growth could surpass the outbreak of SARS in 2002-2004.
An expert at Washington University in St. Louis estimated that the global supply chain suffered more than $300 billion in damage that could last for up to two years.

All three indices were up more than 10% at the end of the week.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock market has fallen again due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many are considering the possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohammad El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the Central Bank and the State.
Central banks are responding faster than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by the governmental restrictions against travel to all places of interest, including tourist destinations, and all over the world.
As a result, multiple airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas cancelled flights for comparatively low demand, as British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the shipping industry has never been seen before.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The Chinese New Year holiday marks the beginning of the main travel season in China, known as Chunyun, when the pandemic began in China.
Many events that could have large crowds, such as the annual New Year festival, have been closed by national and regional governments, private companies have closed their shops, and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong's Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland have been closed.
Many lunar New Year festivals and tourist gatherings, including the Forbidden City and the traditional temple fair, have been closed in Beijing to prevent crowds.
Officials in 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions extended the New Year holiday until February 10 and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, shut schools until March and cancelled New Year celebrations.
In Europe and Latin America, store visits fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
As a result, the number of shoppers in shopping centers in March decreased by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators worldwide imposed additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events.According to estimates from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession triggered by the global pandemic could push 14 to 22 million more people into extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been the case had it not been for the global pandemic.
In January and February 2020, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stranded at home in the hinterland or stranded in Hubei Province.More than 10 million Americans lost their jobs in March 2020 and applied for government assistance.
The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis calculates that the coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million job losses in the US and 32% unemployment.Lockdowns in India have left millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid per day wage/per-hour) unemployed.A survey by the Angus Read Institute found that 44% of Canadian households suffer some form of unemployment.Some 900,000 workers in Spain have lost their jobs since the lockdown in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British employees applied for universal credit schemes.
The German short-time work compensation scheme has also been adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations as well as individuals - both working professionals and individuals - globally.
The institutions of the arts and culture sector tried to maintain their (often government-funded) mission of providing access to cultural heritage in the community, maintaining the safety of their staff and the public, and assisting artists where possible.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres, and other cultural institutions across the world, and to varying degrees, had closed indefinitely, cancelling or delaying their exhibitions, events, and performances.
In response, there has been a stepped-up effort to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The Vatican has announced that Holy Week, the celebration of the last week of the penitential season of the Christian Lent, is cancelled in Rome.
Many dioceses have advised elderly Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches have made church services available through radio, online live streaming or television, and others are hosting worship services without getting out of cars.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square becoming empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious authorities have also canceled services and restricted crowds at churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and Gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and subsequently closed religious sites, and Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as residents of the country to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disaster in the global sporting calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season have been either cancelled or postponed.
"The outbreak has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would ""restart on any date after 2020 but not later than summer 2021"".Casinos and other gaming venues worldwide are closed, and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled".
Reports of significant growth in new sign-ups to gambling sites suggest that this has resulted in many gamblers moving online.The entertainment industry has also been hit as various musical groups have suspended or cancelled their tours of the waterfall.
Many major theaters, including those on Broadway, have suspended all performances.
"Some artists continued to create and share art via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live events, such as live streaming of concerts or creating web-based ""festivals"" so that artists could perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online, countless coronavirus-themed Internet memes have been circulating that are very funny and distract from this uncertain time.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a rise in prejudice, fear of foreigners and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and against people from hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia-Pacific, there have been instances of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Case reports from February document racist attitudes towards groups of Chinese people around the world, claiming they deserve the virus or what is being done to them as retaliation.
There has also been a rise in anti-China sentiment in some African countries.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against based on geographical location.
There was support for the Chinese both online and offline, and for the people in the virus-stricken areas.
People in Italy, who experienced the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak as the first country in Europe to progress to new hotspot countries, may be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseNotComingToJapan became very popular.
Racist attacks on Chinese and other Asians in the UK and US are reported to be on the rise, as well as the level of attacks.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", as critics consider the phrase racist and anti-Chinese".
Ukrainian protesters attack buses carrying Ukrainian residents and returning foreigners from Wuhan to Nabi Sanjari.
Students from northeast India, which shares a border with China, who are studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been subject to harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
"Delipe Ghosh, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why they took revenge against their God".
The Chinese Consulate in Kolkata strongly criticized the comments in Kolkata and called them "misguided". Xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents in China has increased during the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign trash" and labeled "extraneous".
There are some other newspapers including the Paywall that have removed them from their partial or complete coronavirus coverage.
Many specific publications have produced scientific papers related to the phenomenon that are available in open access.
Some scientists favor rapid publication of their results on innovative servers such as Biorextive.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and identify antibodies generated in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including people who were too weak to report symptoms or who were asymptomatic.
The results of the trial can be used to determine an accurate mortality rate of the disease and group immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population until March 2020.
No country had tested more than 3% of its population by 23 March, and there are wide variations in the number of tests conducted across countries.
This difference is likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which in some countries is likely to be significantly higher.
Respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples, can be tested using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with a throat swab is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
The virus may disappear from the throat later in life, but may continue to grow in the lungs.
In case of infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can then be taken from the deep of the respiratory tract by a suction catheter, or a coughing excretion (throttle) can be used.
One of the early PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 at the Charité in Berlin, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and it formed the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test by 23 January 2020.South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-stage PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the common ""E"" gene found in all beta coronaviruses and the characteristic RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States is distributing RT-RPC panels for real-time diagnosis of 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resources".
The older versions of the test kits had unresolved results due to defective reagents in one of the three genetic tests and caused a test blockage at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed per day throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and state and local laboratories were not allowed to begin testing until then.
The trial was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.U.S. commercial labs began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 testing available nationwide on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced; sampling and processing must be performed as per the CDC requirements.
The COVID-19 test in Russia was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in greater than 3.5 hours, thus allowing a machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests over a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a trial on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid similarly received EUA from the FDA for a test, which took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require periodic temperature cycles, the procedure can give positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the US and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day.One test using a monoclonal antibody, which specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus, and is being developed in Taiwan with the hope that it will yield results in 15 to 20 minutes just like a rapid influenza test.
"A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "the early-stage chest radiograph is of little importance in the diagnosis, but the data from CT [computed tomography] may indicate its presence even before the onset of symptoms". "
CT features include a bilateral, multilobard ground-glass opticity with a marginal, asymmetric and retrograde distribution.
The disease develops with subpleural dominance, crazi paving and consolidation.
A study comparing PCR with CT in Wuhan, the site of the current epidemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, but less specific, than PCR, and that many of its imaging features are consistent with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CT should not be used as a first-line test for screening or diagnosis of COVID-19"".
The production of antibodies including IgM and IgG is part of the immune response to infection.
They can be used to detect infection in humans, to assess immunity and to monitor the population from 7 days after onset of symptoms.Evaluations can be performed by central laboratories (CLT) and point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Many essential laboratories will have high performance automated systems capable of performing this assay, but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is commonly used for CLT, although sequential samples may also be used to follow the immune response.
A single blood sample is usually taken through a skin puncture for PoCT.
A collection step is not required before testing, as with the PCR method. On March 26, 2020, the FDA announced the names of 29 organizations that had notified the agency as needed and were therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use approval.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test has the capacity to take hundreds of samples in a few hours, and therefore is much faster than traditional PCR assays of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK learned that none of the antibody test kits they had purchased were good enough to be used.
"Hong Kong has created a scheme where suspicious patients can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", he will spit in it, return it, and receive the test results shortly after.The British NHS announced that they are launching a scheme on a trial basis to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting other people when they go to a hospital, or the need to disinfect it if they use an ambulance.A healthcare professional uses appropriate precautions to sample for suspected cases of COVID-19 in a drive-through test".
Drive-through centers have helped South Korea to have the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.The National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians in Germany said on 2 March that their mobile setting has the capacity to perform around 12,000 tests per day, and that 10,700 people had been tested in the previous week.
When the test is ordered by a doctor, the health insurance covers the costs.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the overall capacity to test 160,000 people a week.
Drive-in tests were offered in many major cities on March 19.
The total number of tests completed in Germany on 26 March 2020 was unknown, as only positive cases were reported.
"A first lab study revealed that a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested up to and including 12/2020 calendar week, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and tested a method to combine samples from 64 patients to test samples together, and only test further if the combined sample was found positive. On 5 February 2020, the BGI opened a temporary emergency detection laboratory in Wuhan called ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, or "the fire eye" in Bengali), which can process more than 10,000 samples a day".
The construction supervision and modeling by BGI founder Wang Jian of the construction to be completed in 5 days showed that without the increase in testing capacity in a timely manner, incidents in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated cost of dealing with quarantine would have been doubled.
Huo-Yan labs in a total of 12 cities across China, including Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, quickly followed the Wuhan Laboratory.
The testing capacity was 50,000 per day in total by 4 March 2020. Open source, multiplexed designs published by Origami Assays have been released that can test a maximum of 1122 patient samples for COVID19 using only 93 tests. These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
By March, the shortage and insufficient amount of reagents had become a limitation to mass testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some researchers to explore sample preparation protocols where samples were heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free RNA genomes for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the UAE is now testing more people for coronavirus than any other country and is on track to increase the level of testing to reach a larger portion of the population.
"This was done by combining drive-through capabilities and the purchase of a population-scale mass production laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to operate outside of China.
Various testing methods have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The German model of producing kits for low-income countries that do not have the resources to make their own kits was adopted by the WHO.
The German variant was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol prepared by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, which delayed the tests available in the US. There were problems between China and the United States over the reliability of the test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to meet the demand and supply enough kits for the recommendations of testing by health experts.
Conversely, experts say that South Korea's high testing rate has helped to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
The South Korean administration has built up its testing capacity over the years, mainly in private sector labs.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increase in testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The increased demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in the creation of several million test backlogs in private US labs, and pressure on the supply of swabs and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
"There were ""flaws"" in the test kits prepared by the CDC in the United States; then the administration removed the bureaucratic obstacles that prevented private testing.Spain purchased the test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were incorrect".
The company explained that the wrong results could be the result of failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall the kits with incorrect results, and replace them with a different kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.The Czech Republic had 80% of the test kits purchased from China with incorrect results.Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
Prime Minister Matovič proposed that they be dumped in the Danube River.Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits Turkey had purchased from China had "high rates of defects" and that they "did not use them".The UK had purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Testing and subsequent quarantine of those who tested positive and identification of contacts of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 resulted in positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vaughan, site of the first death from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted the trial in two phases over a total population of 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Of those who tested positive, almost half had no symptoms and all those identified were quarantined.
The movement controls in the commune have completely eliminated the new infection.
By aggressively tracking people in contact, through inbound travel controls, testing and quarantine, but without any extreme controls such as forcible closure of restaurants and retail establishments, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after a holiday break on 23 March.
Several other countries have aggressively contained the global pandemic through contact tracing, inbound travel control, testing and quarantining, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with high testing rates had much lower mortality rates than those with high mortality rates, possibly because these countries were able to detect patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have limited experience with COVID-19 in national laboratories should send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
"The "Percentage of tests positive" column in the chart below is influenced by the testing policy of the country".
Countries that test only people who are admitted to hospital will have a higher positive test rate than countries where all other things being equal, all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, refers to the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap at certain 'important moments' during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through feces or mouth".
People can also contract respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five important moments of the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's urine or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and before preparing food or serving raw meat, fish, or poultry, and after handwashing.
If water and soap are not available, ash can be used to wash hands.
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or cleaning the toilet that a child has used.
Your nose is stuffy, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the healthy practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medication or medical care can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands clean of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that are harmful or can cause disease.
This is especially important for people who care for or work with food in the medical field, but it is also an important process for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the transmission of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing the infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate during home delivery.
A 2013 study found that improved hand washing habits can drive short-term improvement in height growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, introducing simple behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap can reduce the mortality rate of children with respiratory and diarrhea related diseases.
This simple procedure can reduce the death rate from this disease by about 50%.
Handwashing is a popular practice that can reduce diarrhea by about a third, and is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
Handwashing with soap is associated with a 48% reduction in diarrhea incidence. Handwashing with soap is the only effective and affordable way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI) and is performed as an automatic practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, which is a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age. It kills an estimated 1.8 million children every year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia are the common causes of death for about 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the firm habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half, and reduce deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is integrated with other sanitation measures as part of the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing protects against infectious skin diseases (impetigo) that are transmitted through direct physical contact.
One of the minor side effects of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying out of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, flaky skin known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five key times of day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce infection of the faecal-oral cavity are: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning the child's stool or changing the diaper, before feeding the child, before eating, and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper hand washing techniques should be applied to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or after petting an animal; and after touching litter.
In many countries, the rate of handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that, on average, 38.7% of households are accustomed to hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States had the middle at about 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Several practices of behavior modification are now in place to promote hand washing with soap in times of crisis.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of adequate measures to promote children's health and education.
The main focus of the program is to eradicate bed bugs twice a year, wash hands with soap every day, and brush teeth with fluoride every day.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The addition of soap or detergent to the water increases the removal of microscopic organisms from the skin.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the impedance of the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is ineffective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soils, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning is usually done with a moderate flow of water.
Nitrate soap, due to its reusable nature, can retain bacteria from previous use.
A small number of studies that have looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soaps concluded that the transfer is less likely because the bacteria are washed with foam.
"The CDC still says that "liquid soap that can be controlled without using hands is preferred for application".
There has been a lot of publicity around antibacterial soaps among the health conscious public.
There is no evidence to date of the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants for nature's antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan, which has a high resistance to organisms.
So, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as marketed.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective ingredients, refined preparations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioners (alovera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) as pH regulators. A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health suggested that trichloroquine-based antibacterial soaps are as effective as generic soaps for preventing illness and removing bacteria from hands.
The comfortable warm water for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very quickly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water in removing the natural oil that holds the soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A non-water-based hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic that is a component of a non-water-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand rubs (also known as alcohol-based rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) that are not water-based began to gain popularity.
To reduce the availability and drying effect of alcohol, gel carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) or humicants such as in liquid form or in foam are mostly made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, prepared in combination with a thick component such as glycerin.
The addition of mixed hydrogen peroxide further enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer contains a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol which is effective in killing germs.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (which include HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizer contains 70% alcohol which kills 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to a 35 decibel reduction) after 30 seconds of application on the hand and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of bacteria after 1 minute of application on the hand. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and relatively less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against the norovirus (or norovirus) type of virus, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Adequate hand antiseptic or alcohol rub should be used to wet hands thoroughly or apply aga-gourd.
The liquid, foam or gel is rubbed on the front and back of both hands and between the fingers and the end for approximately 30 seconds until it dries.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands thoroughly with hand sanitizer rubs, especially if the hands are dirty.
Increasing use of these ingredients depends on their ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin if the formula does not include emollients and/or skin moisturizers.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other lotions to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with a softening agent were found to cause significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or disinfectant detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact dermatitis or hypersensitivity to alcohol or alcohol-containing substances is rare in alcohol hand rub.
Compared to hand washing with soap and water, the lower incidence of painful contact dermatitis became a cause of attraction.
Despite their effectiveness, the waterless material does not clean the organic matter of the hands, but only disinfects the hands.
Since pathogens still remain in the hands, this is why hand sanitizers, which are effective as soap and water, are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends heavily on the ingredients and preparation, and has worked significantly less than alcohol and alcohol rub in the past.
Most recently, benzalkonium chloride has been shown to maintain stable and proliferative antimicrobial activity after application of the preparation, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy has been shown to decline after repeated use due to possibly progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities do not have the financial means to buy soap and instead use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than just water, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease instead of reducing it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it produces an alkaline solution when it comes in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends ash or sand as a substitute.
Proper hand washing techniques recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent infection include the following steps:
Wash your hands in warm or cold running water.
Water is recommended because standing basins can be contaminated, but the water temperature does not seem to make a difference.
Rub the soap bubbles on the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails with sufficient soap.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better when using soap instead of just water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing is a process of friction that removes germs from the skin and more germs are removed by long-term rubbing.
Wash thoroughly in running water.
Washing hands in the sink can re-contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re-contaminated. The most commonly missed areas are the fingers, wrists, the space between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and split nail polish can shelter microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent the hands from drying out; dry skin can damage the skin which can increase the risk of spreading infection.
"In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, various low-cost alternatives can be developed to facilitate hand washing, for example, pouring water from a suspended jarcone or a suitable cavity and/or using ash if necessary. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as ""Tap-Tap"" and other low-cost alternatives".
Tippy-tap is a simple technique where a jug is pulled by a rope and a foot-operated lever and a piece of soap are used to pour a small amount of water into the hand.
Drying hands well is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective type of drying in public washrooms.
A growing body of research indicates that paper towels are much healthier than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
A study was conducted in 2008 to compare the hygiene levels provided by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and more modern jet-air hand dryers, produced by the Paper Towel Industry European Tissue Symposium and conducted by the University of Westminster in London.
After washing hands and drying with a hot-air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased by an average of 194% in the fingers and 254% in the palm of the hand.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% in the fingers and 15% in the palm of the hand.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total bacteria decreased by an average of 76% on the fingers and 77% on the palms of the hands. The scientists also conducted tests to prove whether each type of drying method resulted in cross-contamination of the other washroom users and the washroom environment.
The jet-air dryer, which blew air at a sustained speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and remove potential contamination of the bathroom users and the bathroom environment by up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot-air hand dryer spreads microscopic organisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of micro-organisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria have been observed after hand drying:
There are many different types of hand dryer manufacturers and the hand dryer has been compared to the paper towel dryer.
In the absence of soap and water, hand sanitizing wipes are an alternative to hand washing during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer has at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory in hospital settings long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered the efficacy of hand washing in the prevention of disease (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff if they forget to wash their hands.
One study found that they reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand-washing is done for at least 15 seconds and using sufficient soap and water or gel to scrub each part of the hand.
Fingers should be joined and hands rubbed together.
A bristle brush can be used to remove dirt under the nails.
Since germs can be present in hand water, it is important to wash the foam well and wipe it with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water tap (and open another door for exit if necessary).
This prevents contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
"The purpose of hand washing in health care settings is to remove disease-causing pathogens (""germs") and avoid their transmission".
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that in most medical settings hand washing deficiencies remain unacceptable, with large numbers of doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus causing microbial infections.
Studies have shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-associated bloodstream infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a paper demonstrating the standard hand washing and hand-washing in the health care sector.
The draft hand hygiene guidelines by the organization are also available on its website for public comment.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene when regulatory compliance verification is required.
"The World Health Organization has defined the "five moments" for hand washing:
After contact with blood/body fluid
Before the work of disinfecting, and
"After caring for the patient. The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soap) provides the ability to destroy the ingredients in hand wash".
Such disinfection may be desirable before surgery or in areas where antibiotic-resistant organisms are present. For surgical procedures, it is essential to have a hand-scrubbing tap that can be turned on and off without touching with the hand, a handwashing system with some chlorhexidine or iodine, a hand sanitizer to dry after washing, and a brush for scrubbing and other sanitizing devices for cleaning under the nails.
All the jewels must be unlocked.
The procedure usually requires 2-6 minutes of hand and elbow washing.
Hand rubbing is not necessary for long (10 minutes).
During washing, the water from the wrist to the elbow must be prevented from flowing back to the palm.
After washing, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use hand antiseptics.
For the control of staphylococcal infection in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit of hand-washing was from the first 20% of washing, and that the additional benefit was very small when hand-washing repetition was increased above 35%.
Washing with antibacterial soap compared to regular soap resulted in three times the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease to food. Comparing hand-washing with alcohol-based solutions with hand-washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that hand-washing with alcohol-based soap reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile germs from hands. Healthcare environments may involve issues of hand washing, staff education and written and oral reminders to staff about the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs to improve hand hygiene.
Further research is needed to determine which of these enhancements are most effective in different healthcare environments.
Handwashing with soap is recognized in developing countries as a cost-effective, essential means of achieving good health, even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces poses a challenge to achieve universal hand washing habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, there are inexpensive options for creating hand washing sites, but there are rarely hand washing machines near every private or public toilet.
However, low handwashing rates can be due to deep-lying habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advice of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to long-term habit change in the population.
For it to work effectively, it needs to be monitored and evaluated.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in hand-washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of hand-washing campaigns in schools is UNICEF's ""Three Star Approach"" which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic needs".
If the minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars.
Establishing hand washing stations can be a part of helping the hand washing campaign that is being conducted to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to change habits. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the recognition of handwashing emojis.
DYALs have considered several studies on the overall cost savings of hand washing in developing countries on prevention.
However, a review found that promoting handwashing with soap is comparatively more cost-effective than other water/sanitation systems.
"The importance of hand washing for human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations, such as mothers in hospital who have just given birth or wounded soldiers - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
Until then, most people believed that the infection was caused by a foul odor called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and healthcare-related infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important means of preventing the spread of infection.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these types of infectious diseases.
"For example, in Germany, posters with "right hand washing techniques" were hung in public restrooms and near hand washing sinks in office buildings and airports".
"The phrase 'shake hands' means to express one's disapproval of being responsible for or complicit in wrongdoing".
It originates from the Matthew Bible passage where Pontius Pilate waved his hand at Jesus Christ's decision to crucify him, but has become a language idiom with more widespread use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands in an attempt to cleanse the fictional stain of madness by expressing her guilt over the crime she committed and the incitement to which she had led her husband.
It has also been found that people, when thinking or thinking about immoral acts, tend to wash their hands more than others and tend to value hand washing equipment more highly.
"Furthermore, those who are asked to wash their hands after such intentions are less likely to engage in other 'cleansing' compensatory activities, such as volunteering".
Religions prescribe handwashing for both health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic handwashing, using water/water to wash hands but not soap, is a part of the handwashing ritual characteristic of many religions, including the Baha'i Faith, Hinduism, Tewahwahwah and Neotilat Yada'im in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Ozu in Islam. Religions prescribe the practice of washing hands after performing certain tasks.
Hand washing after using the toilet is obligatory in Hindu, Jewish and Islamic religions.
And, before and after every meal, it is mandatory to wash hands in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam.
Control of workplace risk for COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational safety and health practices to control risk to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate risk controls at workplace depend on the workplace and the work to be done, a risk assessment of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual worker risk factors that may be at risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, which is why standard infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, breathing etiquette, and regular cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium risk jobs include those where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but require frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected due to the disease spreading in the community at the place of business or due to international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the public, such as in schools, in high-density work environments, and in some of the busiest retail locations.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include ventilation using air filters of advanced capability, sneeze guard and availability of personal protective equipment in case of encountering a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and those working in the morgue to be at high risk of exposure to persons with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.This risk is increased if these workers employ aerosol-producing processes or collect or handle samples from any confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections through these processes.
Risk controls appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation chambers, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job.
There are many possible effects of a COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, to care for others, or for fear of possible exposure.
The type of business can change both in terms of what products are in demand and how these products are purchased (e.g. buying at off-peak times or through delivery or drive-through services).
Finally, shipments from geographical areas heavily affected by COVID-19 may be disrupted.An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective measures.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from the home and community environment, and personal risk factors of employees such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address the risks and the preparedness plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The objectives of the response to the outbreak include reducing infection among staff, protecting people at risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse impacts on other organisations in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses received.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a framework that is widely used to control occupational safety and health performance.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating workers from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, and this may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes to work-related policies or procedures that require action by the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk of the worker, as well as being fitted appropriately as applicable (e.g. respirator), worn consistently and appropriately, inspected, maintained and replaced regularly, and properly opened, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), work with low exposure risks has minimal occupational contact with the public and other co-workers.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for the workplace include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, providing breathing etiquette including covering the mouth during sneezing and coughing, tissue and litter disposal, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if necessary, encouraging employees to use other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining a routine of cleaning and sanitizing the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step to protect workers, customers, interviewees and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home as long as they are free from fever, signs of fever, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying drugs, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, exposed middle-risk jobs include those where COVID-19 is not known or suspected, but requires frequent or close contact with people who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 within six feet (1.8 m) due to ongoing disease spread in the community at the place of business or recent international travel to a place where the person has had a widespread COVID-19 outbreak.
Engineering controls for this and for high-risk groups include installing high-performance air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing transparent plastic sneeze guards, installing physical barriers, and installing a drive-through window for customer service. Administrative controls for this and for high-risk groups include encouraging sick employees to stay at home, cancelling face-to-face meetings by virtual communication, or changing shifts, and introducing a face shield, and introducing a COVID-19 curfew, providing regular training to people who are not exposed to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or a person who is at risk of exposure to a workplace that may require them to respond to personal health concerns, such as the risk of contact with a patient, the safety of a workplace, the safety of a work environment, the need to protect their hands and hands, and other workplace safety measures, such as employee safety, the use of hand shields, and other safety precautions, and training on how to avoid COVID-19 by regularly avoiding face-to-face meetings or face-shift meetings.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to be on a respirator.
If people become ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect the crew and other passengers include separating the sick person 6 feet from others, assigning a crew member to serve the sick person, and providing the sick person with a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or coughing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when responding to a passenger's call or when touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment should probably be used if the passenger is ill with fever, persistent cough, or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should then be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial vessels, including pleasure ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls include postponing travel if ill, isolating oneself, and informing the on-board medical centre immediately if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In cases of illness, the CDC recommends that the school and childcare facilities be closed for a short period of time to clean or disinfect if an infected person enters the school premises, regardless of the transmission of disease in the community.
When there is a minimal to moderate spread of disease in a population, social distancing strategies may be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, gatherings, and other large gatherings, such as physical education or band music classes or eating in cafeterias; increasing the distance between desks, separating office visitation and vacation times, limiting unnecessary appointments, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When disease is rampant in the local community, school closures may be considered to be further extended in addition to social distancing tactics.The health risks of law enforcement personnel performing routine activities are considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to come into contact with people who are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of personnel coming into close contact during a time of distress, their duty belts and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected using a household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse, and evidence management procedures should be followed to control and dispose of used PPE.
OSHA considers certain health care and death services workers to be at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk occupations of exposure include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who come into contact with patients known or suspected to have COVID-19.
If staff perform aerosol-inducing procedures, or collect or transport samples from patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, these become at high risk of exposure.
Aerosol-generating procedures include tubing, cough-initiating procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and the collection of samples by inserting tests or instruments.
High-exposure, death-related jobs include workers involved in the preparation of the bodies of all people known or suspected to have COVID-19 at the time of death; this becomes very high-exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for people in this high-risk group include isolation rooms for patients known or suspected to have COVID-19, when aerosol-enhancing procedures are performed.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and funeral environments.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 caution.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be segregated into separate waiting areas based on whether they are suspected to have COVID-19.For people working within 6 feet of those who are known or suspected to have SARS-CoV-2, and for people performing aerosol-generating procedures, OSHA recommends respirators in addition to other PPE.
In the United States, a NIOSH-approved N95 or higher filtering faceplate respirator must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program, including health screening, training, and medical testing.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend covers, as COVID-19 is not spread through bodily fluids, but is a respiratory disease.
WHO recommends a surgical mask for entry screening staff only.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown and gloves for those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without an aerosol-producing method.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
In view of the global inadequate supply of PPE, WHO recommends the use of physical distancing such as telemedicine, transparent windows to reduce the need for PPE, and allowing only those directly involved in caregiving to enter a COVID-19 patient's room, using PPE only for specific needs, continuing to use it without removing respirators while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, allowing monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the wearing of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We find ourselves in a unique situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a phenomenon that highlights the global interconnectedness of humanity and our responsibilities to each other.
We have no precedent for the challenges it faces, but we know that our best response depends on the global compassion, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The intimacy, trust and care we have seen in emails, calls and chats among all our colleagues is a remarkable testament to the incredible people we are so lucky to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as my colleagues.
Last week someone shared with me his appreciation for our work.
They reminded me of how much it means for the world to be able to see Wikipedia at this moment and how powerful a symbol it is that this important resource is online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether it's keeping our sites up or paying our colleagues or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
It's a moment where not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant changes to the way we work together from this coming week.
We can also make adjustments in our work schedule.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and to set a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought was the appropriate response to the situation we were facing and the best way to sustain the organization at this time.
Most of us wanted to relieve stress and support our cause for the long term.
If you need to dial back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract workers:
Until further notice, our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work at a more normal time, the mission can use you.
But right now the world is uncertain, and whether you need to care for a loved one or pick up groceries or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not keeping track of your time.
Do not work if you are sick.
It's hard to say, but we're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, please let Brian at T&C Ops know so that T&C can assist and ensure that your situation receives appropriate attention from the authorities.)
People working by the hour will be paid in full.
We have already said, and we pledge again, to honor our commitments to our contractors and colleagues who work as watchmen.
All employees will be paid on the basis of normal hours of work under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people use work as a way to divert their stress from the world around us to a particular direction.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like this.
Again, it's about taking care of yourself.
We want you to keep in touch with your manager so we know what to expect and can make adjustments accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are things we must do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform essential tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all our departments to assess current goals and shift our focus to collaborate on what is necessary for our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, but we will all focus on the most important projects.
You can't hurt yourself if you work slowly.
We are not planning to work double hours after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to complete the work by the deadline, which is not realistic.
We recognize that the situation has changed, and we will work to set new targets and deadlines where appropriate.
What happened to the APP?
In order to align with our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we also want to align the timeline for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
The intention is to propose an expansion of our 2019-2020 plan, which prioritizes essential work for employees, allows more time to prepare budgets to take care of themselves and their loved ones, while also accepting the demands of all those who want or need to work reduced hours over the next few weeks.
This extension of the time limit greatly reduces the workload of the current planning and the stress on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and we will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Office condition, contact and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But out of an abundance of caution, we hired a team of antiseptic cleaners to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiretroviral solution to disinfect every surface and lobby and the elevator banks that entered our floor.
The building is employing its own care responsibility protocol using products that help to protect their tenants.
We are relieved that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and with all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office moved to a fully remote setup in line with instructions given to San Francisco.
Some of our NYC-based colleagues know that we were also discussing leasing a space in Brooklyn.
The talks are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote colleagues know that this can be a compromise, and wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the length of the meeting to one or two hours if it is too long.
If longer sessions are required, consider breaking them up into smaller sessions over a few days.
Make the meeting clear, have a schedule and send the materials ahead of time.
With tools like Google Docs and Zoom, set video as the default to facilitate live collaboration and connectivity.
To facilitate each meeting, have a lead, have someone monitor questions in the chat and keep an eye on the speaker list, and have someone take notes (or collaboratively take notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to tech support.
Use your wellness reminiscence for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your coworkers about shared work.
The HR management team is looking to webinar-based ergonomics instruction to help grow the Foundation-wide distributed work.
This past week we asked all community donors to cancel public events like the Wikimedia-funded Edytheathon until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We inform them that we understand that our request for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed donation process and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying these goals.
In the coming weeks, we will be releasing additional guidance for Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The gloom over the general disruption of the global public mood, but at the same time the ability of Wikimedia and others, to focus on their own public community and the clarity of the relief, seems to have both.
In the coming days, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki, to provide a place for the public to monitor the impact and follow our interactions with them.
Staying in touch with COVID-19 related issues
We will send you an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share additional updates and answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
In this situation, we are all united and we will help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to search for information from this email, and other important information about COVID-19 on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular contact with staff currently living in the significantly affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major work stream or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please don't hesitate to let us know and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide and coordinate as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, please email Bryan Judan, Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a dereliction of our duty and responsibility.
It's more an admission that we may have to adapt our roles and responsibilities in this moment in ways that we haven't done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to work, to provide the support our movement needs, and to deliver the services the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
It is time to support each other and make room for the important work that is coming up in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do that, we need all of you, and that's why we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that when you need care, you can be as healthy as you can be.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Catherine, the CRT team (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Hymie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S) and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Hi V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the cell membrane of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the action of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang ((1-7)), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that is present on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein has an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal colectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose active site in the enzyme is uncovered on the cell surface of lung and other tissues.
The exogenous domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shadesis, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane associated with type II alveolas of the lungs, enterocytes of the small intestine, most organ arteries and venous endothelial cells, and thin muscle cells of the arteries.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counterbalance to ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) from angiotensin II and hydrolyzes it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH) by the following reaction:
ACE2 can isolate several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dyneorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 regulates the membrane exchange of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus responsible for SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike S1 proteins to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and displacement of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes located within the cell.
This entry process also requires priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic. This has led some to speculate that lowering the level of ACE2 in the cell may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continued use of evidence-based ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that ""compared to controls, the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia""".
"In addition, patients treated with ACE inhibitors, especially those with stroke and heart failure, who were at high risk of developing pneumonia, also had a reduced risk of developing pneumonia".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the effect was less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory symptoms.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is about 10 hours and the onset of action is in 30 minutes, and the duration of action (stability) is 24 hours.
Evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be promising in individuals who cannot tolerate first-in-class renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or have diseases in which angiotensin II transport is increased. rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
b'COVID-19 apps are "mobile software applications designed for contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people who have been in contact with an infected person (""contacts"") ".
In some regions and jurisdictions, numerous applications were developed or proposed with official government support.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the development of contact tracing apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that work based on app users' geolocation.
Relatively unofficial access options include the use of Bluetooth signals to log user's capture on other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality of supporting such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has launched an app in conjunction with Alipay that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by local IT groups, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched Stop Corona!, a Bluetooth-based app that aims to detect the symptoms of a potentially infected person and provide a quick response to healthcare authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
The app was pending approval in Google Play Store and Apple App Store from 14 April 2020.
"On 12 April, the government said the Connection Finder app was in advanced development and would be available for operation in a few weeks. Similar apps ("StopCovid") are planned in Ireland and France".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to launch a geofencing app for COVID-19 patients living in Moscow to ensure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and a lack of functionality if the app's acceptance is limited to a small segment of the population.
"Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has set limits on what types of companies can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting it to only ""government"" or otherwise reputable companies".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the implications of monitoring people using coronavirus apps, in particular, whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be terminated once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limitations on such surveillance.
The agency announced eight conditions for the government project:
"The observer must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate".
There should be a sunset clause to increase surveillance and vigilance;
Data usage for COVID-19 purposes will be restricted;
Protect security and anonymity and demonstrate evidence-based security;
Digital surveillance was needed to stop the spread of discrimination and marginalization;
Sharing any data with third parties must be specified by law;
Protection against abuse and the right of citizens to protest against abuse.
"All ""relevant stakeholders"" including public health experts and marginalised groups will be required to participate significantly.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Wöhne Grengenz) (RSF) have issued a checklist".
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the need for tracing processes from the operating systems of these devices.
Some countries used network-based location surveillance instead of apps, which eliminates both the need to download apps and the ability to circumvent surveillance.
In Israel, network-based detection was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrealized location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, all systems on the central server do not require access to private location data; multiple privacy-preserving systems have been developed that use the central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
An app-less system was used in South Korea for contact tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking data from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and aggregated them to send text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available, with some of the information authorized due to far-reaching changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using both centralized and privacy-preserving systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details are yet to be released.
Privacy-protected communication detection is a well-established concept with a practical component of research education dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as recording the proximity of another cellphone user using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that has both centralized and decentralized methods and is not a single code of conduct. Decentralized codes of conduct include decentralized privacy-preserving proximity identification (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka contact numbers, CEN), privacy-sensitive codes and processes for mobile contact identification (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, personally identifiable information never leaves the device and all matching occurs within the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques while collecting and using location or path intersection data to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on a white paper titled Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, which was published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that produces privacy technology that was actually founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace utilizes secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health information with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of their data.
On 5 April 2020, the Universal TCN Alliance was founded by a number of groups that came together to address the issues of fragmentation and enable universal interoperability of identifying and alerting apps, which is a key aspect of widespread adoption, including those with essentially the same procedures and large-scale overriding behaviors that were required.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has an open-source BlueTrace protocol that is being used by its government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms respectively, announced an initiative to find people who have come into contact with what they claimed would protect privacy, which works on the basis of a combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also revealed details of the key technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be available in three phases:
Rollout of tools to enable governments to create privacy-preserving official apps to detect coronavirus
Integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android: Google and Apple plan to solve the take-up and continuous monitoring problem by first delivering the system through an operating system update and then removing it in the same way when the disaster is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as re-purposing, re-profiling, new action, or reversible drug modification) is the use of an approved drug to treat a disease or condition other than the disease for which it was originally developed.
It is a path of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convoluted plasma infections. SARS-CoV-2 has around 66 drug-specific proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
These binding sites provide a reasonable scheme for the development of an antiviral drug that is effective against COVID-19 proteins by analysis.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are the papaya-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphatease.
Husain A., et al. studied several candidate compounds that were optimized and analyzed in their pre-clinical studies for skeletal similarity of candidates by the most similar approved drug to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug to recommend clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine were among the four drugs that would be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State's testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is only approved as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but unable to participate in clinical trials within the European Union.
The CDC said that "the use, dose, or stability of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been proven".
The doctors said they had no choice but to use the drug.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is being conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show Favipirab to be "clearly effective".
At 4 days, 35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative, while 45 patients who did not receive it had a disease duration of 11 days.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half were given fevipiravir and half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence in support of the drug is insufficient and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for stockpiling and use the military to supply the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has proposed to the Trump administration to purchase the drug, which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those who are trying to conceive.
"A study of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs Lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
The drugs were planned to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that would bind to the proteases of SARS-CoV-2.There is criticism within the scientific community about using resources to change the purpose of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
Lopinavir/ritonavir is included in the WHO international mutual support test.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in-vitro against multiple phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and corona-viruses.
One challenge of antiviral therapy is the development of resistance through mutation that can lead to more serious diseases and infections.
Several early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for people with additional severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of vitamin C for intravenous administration to hospitalized and critically ill individuals with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York State began the trial for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a diagnostic trial for Teigen's alveolar coagulant (cyclosetronide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, for the treatment of pre-diagnosed patients with novel coronavirus.
A type of trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients in critical, hospitalized conditions to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The COLCORONA study is looking at 6,000 adults aged 40 years or older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and experienced mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not have an effective method of contraception, are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in 300 patients for prophylactic and palliative medicine was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientific attention has traditionally been focused on reconstructing approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile viruses.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for treatment of COVID-19 according to China's 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially new uses for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tsilizoumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been fully clinically tested, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect an effective vaccine against the virus, SARS-CoV-2, to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, there were five vaccine candidates in Phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak occurred worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using the released genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI initiative was said to be a condition for vaccine development, with speed, production capacity, large scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were working towards research and development in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform objectives that have advanced in the Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The virus-borne vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Cancino Biologics, Adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccinated individuals are in the early stages of improvement, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (according to the Milken Institute, 79) and 37 have been reported as others, but all from little publicly disclosed data (assumed to be planned).
Phase I-II trials conduct initial safety and immunity testing and are typically randomised, placebo-controlled, and conducted at multiple sites to determine a more specific, effective dose.
Phase III trials with a vaccine's effectiveness and control group for disease prevention typically involve more participants, while adverse effects are monitored at optimal doses of the drug.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (as confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been human-based evaluated (still undergoing ""preclinical"" studies)".
Around 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland in Australia announced that it was investigating the possibility of a molecularly bound vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to trigger immune responses.
In Canada, on or around 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-Intervac) announced that it would begin work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies led by Hanneke Schuitemaker announced that they had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is developing the Seva vaccine together with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Bio Solutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the Oncosun laboratory in Romania published a brief on a vaccine design with similar technology used for neon antigen vaccination therapy for cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning trials.
On 27 February 2020, NewGenrex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Genrex, announced that it was starting a vaccine project to develop a LI-K peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to develop a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced their plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On or around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it has merged with Novavax Inc.
To develop and produce a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and Phase I clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they are working on 11 isolation sites and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine, albeit at a rapid pace.
On 12 March 2020, a biotech company in Quebec City, Quebec reported the development of a coronavirus-like molecule, partially funded by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is under laboratory research with plans to be tested in humans in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered to pay Kuryvak a "huge sum" for a monopoly on the Covid-19 vaccine, which the German government protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, which is currently in pre-clinical trials, and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, an Italian biotech company called Tacis Biotech announced that they would have pre-clinical trial results in April 2020, and that their final vaccine candidate could be tested in humans in the autumn.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) in France announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a research consortium for a COVID-19 vaccine, which included Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and Pitt University, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical defence against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian institutions and universities such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
"At the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million for the development of COVID-19 vaccines specifically, and plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of an outbreak of another coronavirus".
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing of a potential COVID-19 vaccine called PittCoVacc in mice, stating that "SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines inactivated by MNA produced a strong antigen-specific antibody response [in mice] that were detected as early as 2 weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced plans for a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
DNA will be engineered using bacteriophages to replicate inside human bacteria to prepare harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, three integrated entities were created by the US government, industry and universities to gain access to supercomputers from IBM, comprising Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google's cloud computing companies.
There are some marker heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Efforts are underway to enroll 4,170 healthcare workers for an additional non-clinical trial in Australia.
There is a possibility that the vaccines under development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research evaluating the efficacy of vaccines in COVID-19-specific animal models such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human mammals indicates the need for biosafety-level 3 controls and international coordination for managing live virus to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective for humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS emerged, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for developing vaccines and immunizations against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed the first clinical trials in humans and three others are ongoing, all of them viral-vector vaccines, two adenoviral-vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents mentioned in various social media posts relate to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other variants of coronavirus, such as SARS coronavirus.
B'coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are mild, in some cases it may progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is spread to humans primarily through close contact, often through small saliva particles caused by coughing, sneezing or talking.
When the saliva particles are produced during exhalation, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than spreading over long distances.
People can become infected by touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching contaminated surfaces.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious during the first three days of onset of symptoms, although it is likely to be spread before symptoms appear and during later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.
Those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers are advised to wear masks.
Recommendations for the general public to wear masks vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others recommending their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
People with the virus may be asymptomatic or may experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Urgent symptoms include shortness of breath, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in waking up, and drooping mouth or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Relatively less common, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were observed with a percentage variation.
In China, some cases were initially only observed with chest tightness and throbbing.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ paralysis and death.
It's called the germ envy phase.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who are symptomatic will show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not everyone who is infected will show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in infection is not yet fully understood; however, early evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who did not show symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were asymptomatic during hospitalization.
On 1 April, China's National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases; 130 (78%) of the 166 infected on that day were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both saliva and saliva can carry a large number of viruses.
Speaking out loud is more spitting than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a mask can cause small droplets to spread up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has indicated that bioaerosol transmission is possible and air collectors placed in the hallway outside the home of the person tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause respiratory emissions to be converted to air molecules and thus airborne spread.
While there are concerns that it could spread through the feces, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when symptoms are seen in humans; it may be possible to spread before symptoms become apparent, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, but one person typically infects two to three others.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on cardboard for up to a day, plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for up to three days, and 99% copper for up to four hours.
It varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents can also be effective when used properly; soap pans break down the virus's fatty protective layer, rendering it inert and releasing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after the start of hospitalization.
Five of the six patients had the first sample showing the highest viral load, and the sixth patient tested the second day with the highest viral load.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three patients with pneumonia associated with a group of acute respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.The original SARS-CoV is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The lungs are the most affected organ by COVID-19 because the virus enters host cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that is abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
"The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called ""spike"" (papelomers) to bind to ACE2 to enter the host cell".
Acute cardiac trauma was reported in 12% of people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe illness.
The cardiovascular symptom rate is higher due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors travel rapidly to the heart and are involved in cardiac activity.
Thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been reported in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and inflammatory infiltrate-containing lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tendency to target the respiratory connecting epithelial cells ACE2, severe COVID-19 patients have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells in COVID-19 patients have been shown to be associated with inflammatory IL-6-removed monocytes and recruitment of severe pulmonary pathology.
The autopsy report showed lymphocytic infiltrate.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The ideal method of testing is using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swab or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be performed, but these require two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate the coronavirus strain and release the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and detect whether a person has been infected in the past) were in the developmental pipeline, but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience in testing has shown only 60 to 70% accuracy.
On 21 March 2020, the US FDA approved the first local nurse test for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend methods for detecting infection based on diagnostic characteristics and epidemic risk.
A bilateral, multilobare ground-glass opacity with horizontal, optismal and retrograde distributions is common in early infections.
Subpleural predominance, irregular peving (lobelar septal enlargement by changing alveolar filling) and agglutination may be seen as the disease progresses.
There is little information available on the pathophysiology and microscopic lesions of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung consolidation (water retention in the lungs) and pulmonary edema. The patient is in the hospital, but the patient is not in the hospital.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large-sized atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation including lymphocytic infiltration and the formation of multi-nucleated demon cells
Severe pneumonia: Damaged dispersed alveoli (DAD) with dispersed alveolar secretions.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia curano: organization of secretions in the alveolar cavity and interstitial fibrosis of the lungs
Blood: diffuse intravascular clotting (DIC); leukoarytroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and practicing appropriate respiratory hygiene and not touching eyes, nose or mouth with the hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing, and using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is found.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public to partially limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies are designed to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, limiting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing instructions also include people to keep at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known drug that is effective in preventing COVID-19. As no vaccine is expected until before 2021, the key part of COVID-19 control is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, known as ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or if their hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol if only soap and water are not available. WHO provides two formulations for local production in places where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
The antimicrobial activity in these preparations is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not an active ingredient for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a humicant.
People are driven by supportive services, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and other critical organs that are affected.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of carrying the virus wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory impairment, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to enhance immunity.
Supportive care may be effective for people with similar symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the United States have organized treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen for initial use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of viral transmission, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures such as intubation or hand ventilation that can produce airborne particles.
For healthcare professionals serving people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be kept in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using evidence-based, contact and airborne precautions.The CDC has outlined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE gown, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Respirator (instead of face mask) is recommended if available.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments but the FDA has approved masks for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but effectiveness against specific organic materials is not guaranteed for label-specified uses.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face coverings or homemade masks as a last resort.
Most cases are not severe enough for COVID-19 to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a few hundred cases are severe.
Types of respiratory support for hospitalized people with COVID-19-related respiratory failure are being actively studied, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these will lead to the same benefits for those who are seriously ill.
Some doctors choose to put invasive mechanical ventilation through it when available because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have sufficient hospital beds per capita, limiting the ability of health systems to deal with sudden increases in the number of cases of COVID-19 severe enough to require hospitalization.
A Chinese study found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical assistance for ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 in hospitals end up in ICU.
COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as oxygenation becomes increasingly inconvenient.
Pressure control mode and high PEEP-capable ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery, while reducing the risk of ventilator-related lung injury and pneumothorax.
High levels of PEEP may not be found in older ventilators.
The research for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are under clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
While new drugs may take until 2021 to develop, several drugs under development are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in efficacy and safety trials of potential treatments.The FDA has provisionally approved convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment where the person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to identify 'close contacts' and consequently potential risk of infection using surveillance data.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
The app not only recommends self-quarantine when potential risks are detected, but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to monitor infected people and people in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor mobile phone data of individuals suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to protect those who may have come in contact with infected citizens and to enforce quarantine.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed integrated phone location data to the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency for the prevention and research of the spread of the virus.
Russia used facial recognition technology to identify quarantine breachers.
"The Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Galera said that mobile phone operators told him that "40% of people are wandering around".
The German government hosts a 48-hour weekend hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Also, Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called for creative global solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
People may feel ill due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of self-infection.
"Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and economic downturns are the perfect catastrophes to damage people's mental health and well-being", the BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying.
Similar to other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, this disease can progress mildly with few or no symptoms.
Mild cases usually resolve within two weeks, but severe or life-threatening cases may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data from COVID-19 is lacking.COVID-19 may cause pneumonia in some humans and damage the lungs.
In most severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which can cause respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ disability.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidney, and liver.
In 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, abnormal blood circulation, especially prothrombin time, was observed, while abnormal kidney function was observed in 4% of this group.
Transaminases have been reported in about 20-30% of people with COVID-19.
According to the same report, the time between onset of symptoms and death, including five hospitalizations, was ten days.
However, patients transferred to ICU had a seven-day interval between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full six- to 41-day period.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China found that the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of autopsy samples of the lung showed diffuse alveolar damage including cellular fibromioxide leakage in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in the pneumocytes were observed.
The lung is similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Among the 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, cardiac arrest or damage to the heart due to increased troponin levels was identified.
According to the U.S. National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as of March, 89% of those hospitalized had pre-existing conditions. The socioeconomy of a region and the availability of medical facilities can also affect mortality.
The calculation of the morbidity to mortality ratio varies not only due to the regional differences but also due to the methodological difficulties.
Counting fewer cases of measles can lead to overcounting the death rate.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past infections means that the current mortality rate is being underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital authorities noted a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans indicated organ damage.
It can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether past infections confer effective and long-term immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is highly likely based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported to recover from COVID-19 after a positive test result for the coronavirus at a later stage.
These cases are suspected to be due to worsening of persistent infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and of animal origin, through spillover infection.
The actual source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A review of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 was published in The Lancet in January 2020, with the first date of onset of symptoms reported as 1 December 2019.
The first onset of symptoms was reported by official publications from WHO on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time elapsed since initial onset, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.
In late 2019, the WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to deaths due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.2 to deaths due to clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on statistics from Johns Hopkins University, the worldwide death-to-case ratio was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics do not have a specific timeframe and follow specific populations from infection to diagnosis.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
The epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Casiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, has already seen 80 (1.7%) deaths.
In Gangel, the disease was transmitted through carnival festivals and among younger people, causing relatively few deaths, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
Moreover, the German health system has not been disrupted.
In the Netherlands, blood donors can have antibodies of about 3% as assessed.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The pandemic and its impact on mortality differ for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
Men are at highest risk in their 50s, and the gap between men and women closes in their 90s.
The mortality rate in China was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The exact causes of this gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioural factors may be involved.
Gender-based immunological differences, the relatively low prevalence of smoking among women, and the development of co-morbidities in men at a younger age than women, such as high blood pressure, may play a role in the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
The US government has not been monitoring gender-related data on COVID-19 infections since April 2020.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the disease will be officially named "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI is the virus, D is the disease, and 19 is when the outbreak was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to specific geographical locations (e.g., China), animal species or human groups, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent name-calling.The name of the virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"In public communication WHO additionally uses ""the COVID-19 virus"" and ""the virus responsible for COVID-19"".
"Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as ""coronavirus""".
"During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory illness as provisional names for virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines in terms of the use of virus and disease location.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in the standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers are printing parts for healthcare components such as nasal swabs and ventilators.
In one example, an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, but the supplier was unable to deliver it in the required timeframe, so a local startup tested the manufacturer's product and produced the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and rumors about the source, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
It is believed that humans are capable of transmitting the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find any evidence of replication of the virus in pigs, chickens and chickens.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO began a "mutual support trial" to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise for efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several companies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, whether inactivated or dead, is aimed at eliminating the immediate immune response of the human body to a new infection by COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study targets the S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (DNA or RNA vaccine, an innovative technique for vaccine development).
Experimental vaccines must be tested from one of these strategies for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began in Seattle with four volunteers.
The vaccine contains the harmless genetic code from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent growth has been indicated as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active diagnostic trials are underway since April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most of China's research is being done on the use of antiviral drugs for different purposes, and nine phase III trials of Remdesivir across the country are due to report by the end of April.
A dynamic review of clinical development of COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was prepared in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19 including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
There is experimental evidence of efficacy by Remdesivir as of March 2020.
Diagnostic improvement has been observed in patients treated with the investigational drug Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, the pillars of the research need to be reviewed.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a dose of one gram per day, notes that twice this dose can be extremely dangerous and fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorizations for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine based on the considerations of physicians treating people with COVID-19.The Chinese 7th Edition Guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir in the context of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribahvirine are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitzaxocyanide has been recommended for further vivo studies after demonstrating suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Studies have shown that entry of SARS-CoV-2 is required by interaction with the ACE2 receptor, which prepares the primary spike protein by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that have prevented the medical community from accepting these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine breakdown can be a complicating condition in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-rapid-release properties. Tosilezumab was included in the medical guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing Phase 2 non-surgical trials nationally in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
Blood testing with serum ferritin to detect cytokine disruption means preventing the progression of the disease, which is thought to be the cause of death in some infected people.
In 2017, CAR T cell therapy was approved by the FDA as an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a past-concerned case study for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tosylizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Refined and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 are being explored as a non-vaccine method of inactivating vaccination to those who need it.
The technique was tested for SARS with uncertain results.
Viral inactivation is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may mediate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of generated monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Production of convalescent serum, which consists of liquid blood taken from recovered patients and can be grown to rapidly organize specific antibodies to this virus.
Coronavirus diseases, a class of closely related syndromes
