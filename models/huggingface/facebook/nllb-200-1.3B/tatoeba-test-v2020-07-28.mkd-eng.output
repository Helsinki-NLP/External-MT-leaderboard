It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old dad.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
It's going to take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I want to walk.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
You like the wheel?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't helping me enough.
I'm not going to use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
We were out of water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom has already left.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this? What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7:00 to 9:00.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it all.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good wife.
Dan has shared his racist views publicly.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves have taken the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We're going to make it.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever shot a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a free card.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they been doing?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston. I'm not from Boston.
They're suing the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
How about tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is fierce.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he hasn't been a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love the honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's cheeks were a little warped.
Nobody cares about that.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would definitely answer.
I have to help him.
He's critical of himself.
You'll find out when the time comes.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom swallowed the gum.
I really like your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
We didn't evolve from apes, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything in particular you'd like to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too much of a pussy for me.
I'll do that, if you don't mind.
Tom is right.
You're being kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one judges you.
Stop calling Tom names.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
- Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He wants ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat. I'm not fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you give your best?
Mary's rewriting the movie.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
It was personal.
I better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take your hat off.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London. I'm not going anywhere.
I won't be alone here.
He asked me to look at it.
We better not go out in this storm.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really gonna have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you reverse that?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
You want to sing?
You are lucky.
My nose always runs when I catch a cold.
We met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you understand.
Everyone is looking for luck.
Did anyone else get into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was terrible to me in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat that still had the price on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would have loaned you money if you'd asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he'd be here.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
You don't make a man with a hat.
She tried herself.
Get out of here!
Is the delivery paid for?
I want a beet.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass is breakable.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You haven't seen one of these, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'm going to be fine.
Mosquitoes are the carriers of malaria.
You've been putting this off too long.
I don't know.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's the matter with you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We take checks, too.
The newspaper is a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You hit one.
Macedonian has four verb forms: expressed, conditional, ordered, and superimposed.
They're not gone yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The still surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right on.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We are the champions.
She scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the floor.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I've been trying to find him.
Our court is big.
It's a child's game.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Tom threw me in the fuckin' motherfucker.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
He made a scandal out of standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
It's running out of gas.
Tom is a tramp.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want any ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Be careful not to get dirty in the lime bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary did not wash the dishes.
We weren't expecting them.
Are meals included?
That would follow.
You want to play tennis?
It's going to be fine.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day they will try to escape.
They're all going crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why are you working for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom is gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom may be playing chess with Mary right now.
You're probably right.
Don't talk about her.
How weird!
Isn't that why you won't help him?
Tom has a room to paint.
There are no survivors.
She should have shut up.
I'm not like you!
It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees. Then why are you still alive?
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a spatula in his face.
Tom isn't alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll work.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king had particular difficulty in giving speeches because of his severe speech impediment.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
I licked myself.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
It is worth quoting a famous passage from his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is careless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by man-eaters.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Hey, take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to give it back.
Pull the clamp.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
What, we're not dating?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
So you didn't want the reward?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're pleased.
They're not sincere.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get on the line.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short dresses.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Booty, Albert, your theory is a blunder.
We went broke.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
Tom gave it to me.
There's not a single high ground in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm such a retard!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
A power grill heats the ceramic tiles on the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the chimneys.
Let's forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get it?
Hey, you guys.
I'll just sum it up.
I don't know.
I couldn't take it at first.
His sleeve is stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
- Shut up!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone's gone but him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I insulted you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die, you know.
They knocked on his door.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've examined the situation thoroughly.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here right now.
I'm willing to do that.
The water was up to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to let Tom go.
What a shame!
Don't get too excited.
Sylvia really enjoyed the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How are you to blame?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
- Do you mind?
When does the show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn.
Tom talked Mary into donating money.
I've got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You are weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling too good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold him down!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-step process.
I have a little present for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's your turn to ask, Tom.
Tom isn't shy at all.
Tom ran through the barn.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
It's really hot in Sanfo.
We advertise our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I auditioned a few times, but I didn't get the job.
That was almost 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go soon.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They blocked it.
Tom is tortured.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says his last dentist told him he'd get his nicotine stains removed if he quit smoking.
Do not expect everyone to share your views.
Tom was the one who suggested it.
It just seems wrong to me.
Tom is a smart guy.
Curry is a mixture of many spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a rough night.
Tom drove through town with the brake lever up without noticing.
Yeah, I know.
You want to go camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's going to be there?
We didn't want to take Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm a little bloated.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher must be turning into a grave now.
People often complain about being treated unfairly, failing to recognize that their own behavior is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want to bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right about that.
I've been robbed three times a month.
Can I come with you?
Do you need a break?
I want to work out.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a sound.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me a scumbag.
What's the difference?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up on the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How different you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very active.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used rude language.
Coffee gives you energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big miracle for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is a good writer.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom is really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all perceive her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose line is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you scream?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to pitch our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can accomplish anything.
You'll have to ask him about that.
He gave his word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
I want to travel. Me too.
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I was the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom may be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear, and ran to the window.
I know your family.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is suicide.
The hard-winged, the butterfly, and the swan are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's make a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scraped his knee.
Where do pinos come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I see the menu?
He's a smart guy.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came on, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't succeed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda. I'm not a drinker.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize a guy.
Help me, Tom. I need your help.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're making a spiced-up pepper.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so whatever it is, it's fine.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking on a whim.
I know what it sounds like.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling considerably better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry, you know.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stood up suddenly.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a bug.
Put the bottle down.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept quiet.
I'm hooked up.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He always boasted about his English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
No part of the pig fell off.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticking.
What happens next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom is packing his bags.
What good is that?
That's very helpful.
Tom had his phone vibrating.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
Turns out you're a little unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be shiny.
I can't open the drawer.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear you.
Tom laughed at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
It's not a big priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your beautiful eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom skated on the ice.
I will never surrender.
I hope you're up for the challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first frog I've seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was at home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom isn't very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch your back!
Linda had a seizure and suspects she's pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of painful.
I'll do what I know how to do.
I got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom has recovered.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't be shy.
It's not safe for me here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a whore dress.
I'll say whatever you want.
I hope it's helpful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get this over with.
Beekeepers remove the sap to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I will never forget it.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem very possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This is not blue. This is purple.
Who was he with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before they are one year old, and they eat humans.
Can you get the arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times not to overreact.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on, you know what?
The book is heavy.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The hotel rooms are obviously very bad at soundproofing.
Are you scared?
Please, feed the cat.
We're going to be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn't help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.
Tom is going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is a ride.
Who saw me.
Tom is approaching.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did it come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That worked.
These goats are pale.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't think for a second to try to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's have a party.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
We may be related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is sound asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your folks about it!
She was standing in front of it.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen cloths.
I'm safe now.
Your cheeks look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven't had time to write that report yet.
I can do without it.
There are people who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
Get dressed up.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom could not be stopped.
I love to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
You gonna take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to open the door.
Get down there.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, you should listen to him sometime.
Do you know how to whine?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm going to use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to study.
Hand over the compositions.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered in blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We're having Italian cherries at noon.
Tom is from Boston, too.
That's a tough bull.
I'm going to take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk. He's not going anywhere.
I need sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
I'm good for the evening.
They were traveling east.
Tom is pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The tiles that fell from the roof were shattered.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the tub.
Stop by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom is not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
It's an emergency.
You better go.
Tom slammed the exit.
I have two cameras.
What'd you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game's not over.
Tom dropped his drink.
My wallet was stolen on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to have a hard time understanding what I'm trying to say.
I'm no use to you here.
- Is anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoeba is a parasite.
You do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean Tom is dead.
The waves are made by the wind.
Get a clean glass from the cupboard.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill you.
I left a message.
That's all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "boubamar".
The lift can lift 20 tons of concrete.
You look lovely.
I think it's too risky without any help.
You good at that?
We're pretty good at this.
The pork is chopped into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love to travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice of you.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom is here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
It's actually pretty boring.
You're feeling guilty, aren't you?
I coughed up blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a napkin, your nose is running.
Tom was dating Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were farmers at first.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything you're gonna regret.
I'm excited about this.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wasn't gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
I'm pretty healthy now.
Tom was still in his pajamas and a banjo when I came up on the left.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're in the back.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I tried.
A broken tree blocked the road.
Don't interrupt Tom, please.
There were no more boxes.
Tom has a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
He's the best at math.

Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the wine this morning?
Tom believes in weird things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary that he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me a scumbag.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom is vain.
Some fish can change sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think you've been lied to.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom is downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's got us working too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the best man at every funeral.
Tom is probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's at home.
You want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Humid climates are not typical of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
You can like us on Facebook.
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are really happy don't write down their happiness.
I still don't know what we should do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.

I'm teaching him English.
What usually causes the pain?

This box is made of tin.
She failed the test for a reason.

Just try it.

Is Tom interested?
Here you go.

I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never been surfing.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work outdoors, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's precious stash.
That cake is high in calories.

Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom is alive.
I'm covering for Tom.
We'll be able to seat you soon.

Where's the phone?
We'll get paid well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not a helper.
I may die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So, these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Should we wait here?
You come out naked like that, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say something?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the shops are closed.
You've been doing white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom finished with the pots.
That's not what happened.
Be a man about it.
It's a lot of unnecessary drama.
We believe in the Lord.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go by myself.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom get along with the coworkers?
It smells like cassava.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you a little advice.
Whatever you do, always give your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
What's a short?
Thanks for coming back.
We're being deceived.
The wounded soldier could barely walk.
The sun has just risen.

I'm not fucking with you.
You can ask Tom.

The police threw Dan in jail.
Get back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You missing something?
To sit down and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked through the trees.
I'm going to do it anyway.
I knew you'd side with Tom.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to his prophets.
Tom was acting like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You are so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you guys fight.
I should have been polite.
Keep Tom entertained.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This is perfect.
He was pouring his guts into his bathtub.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is don't give Tom any presents.
Tom was hardworking.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to learn.
He went down the ledge.
Shall I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The European wants to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debt.
She knows the most important capitals.
What's under the blanket?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's all about the drinks.
You ready to go?
Tom obviously went crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to come with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't mean that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her vagina.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough.
First, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had indeed sunk.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did Tom drink?
My work hurts.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, all right?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's really pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was completely wrong.
Please, ask me what it was.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom is under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How do you look?
Tom is a wonderkind.
He walks to school.
It's starting to get in our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what should we do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Don't make a sound.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lived across the street.
I think I can.
Tom is forgetting.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Weave a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never let you in that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
Animals are in danger.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me out to be a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom is ready.
We have to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has enormous potential.
Dan's messages were outrageous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so nervous tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're overstating it.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are outrageous, and they get better as he drinks a few beers.
You have such kind eyes.
You're not good at business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, it will be... when the willow bears grapes.
Tom is a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
He insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when is there a fire?
Tom may be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you.
I didn't give anything away.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one, including me, has been able to answer, despite 30 years of studying the female soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
The peasants are harvesting.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the breach?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom is not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
With each division, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is that what I'm saying to you?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They are vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody is up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Keep my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I got things to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's just enough air in here.
She married a nobody.
The wind is blowing.
Nothing has changed.
You shouldn't wear anything creepy.
The old man broke down before he died.
I don't like that book.
Luckily I got him.
Why would Tom want that?
The sun is one of billions of stars.
I got the spit-pots.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty common.
Did you Google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't worry about it, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom admitted him to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's what I'm doing.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
He who can hear butterflies laugh knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will surrender.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They're drawing lots to see who goes first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There is no hope.
Ifthar is not for you to eat like a commodity!
But if I was in Brazil, I'd be much more afraid.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
You forgot that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just finished my shift.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I'm sick with the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food is cold, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to our right.
Tom isn't an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
He's a bandit, you know.
Tom might have seen it.
Tom is a little knock.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How do you find the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom isn't drunk, but he has been.
I'm very pleased with your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the plug.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a species of mammal.
Dan waved at Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
- Did you like his music? - No, did you?
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to turn.
This will make our job a lot easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave?
He took over the business.
You don't even want fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm here on holiday.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying to ourselves.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Shake your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm good at that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, and myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
It was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every people has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's going to get colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it is.
His legs were bruised.
Tom picked up his keys.
It's all stopped.
Maybe Tom is drunk.
Sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom piss you off?
This is my latest look.
I haven't been well for two days.
The gut is waste.
We don't think that way.
I think Tom is rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're waiting for her.
Going out in the rain is out of the question.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got a stash.
There was no one in town.
I think you know who I am.
It's been a while, boys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was hitting Mary with a fucking egg.
We're all safe now.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of this that's happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't give up hope.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom immediately became worried.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was unable to swim across the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
Enjoy your meal.
The old lady has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely made it.
Did they hire you?
There's gas leaking.
Tom could see Mary was texting.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise all year in Hawaii.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and touch her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We wrapped the carpet.
Let's have a vote.
Tom is sedated.
You can't do what you want.
Sorry to wake you.
Should I continue?
He was breathing.
I'm a patient man. I'm not going to lie to you.
That's not happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was clear.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull is divided into several watertight sections.
Considering what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave it at that.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your shape.
He has false blinkers.
I'm not going to wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I'm not waiting for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
Are you mad at me?
He's not the shy boy he used to be.
- You got it?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We got a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's too simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys in groups, some playing with hammers, some playing with boards, some playing with balls, some riding on wheels or on wooden horses.
Suspicions are what destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both should go.
The pain that love causes is softer than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You need to go home.
Come this way.
I just finished my homework.
Let's stay married.
We're going to find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You banged your head.
We're stuck in the middle.
Give me the seat back.
What is his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom is getting a little bit upset.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad at you.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
I'm having a hard time making new friends.
It's strange how people in the tropics eat spicy foods like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
You're not going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants, because it's pointing both ways.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is real love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false lead.
Tom was struggling.
I said he might come back.
I need you to open the door.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone is singing.
Do you know how to fix a blindfold?
You go.
I forgot his address.
You're going to lunch?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her suit has a pin on one side.
Let's get something.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing well.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had a deal.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom will get out of prison one day.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
It's milky sour.
We ran out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we'll need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they're on our side.
You up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I just lay in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean. I'm not clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard me right.
Tom has a headache.
Oh, my God.
There's no one there.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a greedy man.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
Mommy's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom is a little bit of a jerk.
Tom is not listening.
They want everything you said you'd give them right away.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is that necessary?
Tom stayed.
I'll never cut you down.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask for help.
Maybe you should call them.
No. Some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
We were 18 at the time.
I make thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli but I hate cauliflower.
I get a little cranky when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep it up.
This is repulsive.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already told you, I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
You got drunk.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should pick her.
You're in the right place.
You are gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it up.
Tom gave Mary a rough look.
Tom was wearing a duffer.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It doesn't burn.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if I can.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I've been a lot worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom has a broken heart.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm looking for.
There's so much to do.
You are a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
They're all in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling you as soon as I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they caught me.
I know Tom's address.
What's your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is false: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who is Dan talking to?
We were framed.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom isn't exactly a hard-ass.
It was after midnight.
That is outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom looked around, not expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a big pessimist.
You're entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's get back to the house.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'm gonna tell you a secret that's gonna change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to get hurt.
Their friendship quickly turned to love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm going to stop.
I turned on the light.
Tom wasn't joking.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine the party like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to come with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom made his toast with butter.
We got work to do.
I heard it like a whisper.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I wish I was your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on the ridge.
I'll take anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Christmas is coming up.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, that is an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to this kind of trouble.
You'll be all right.
It was so easy.
I'm sorry, I poured coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom is healthy.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right and the losers are always guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating vibes is quite difficult, if it can be said to be possible at all.
This has been a wild day.
I have some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome the weakness.
How many squats do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Do you have a key?
Let's be realistic about this.
Tea and lemon, please.
Tom has no job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about it.
When he came and found me, he was covered in alcohol.
Tom is getting high.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small stake.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You're too tight when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come after you, Tom.
He won first place in the competition.
I just want you back.
Dan's smoking pot with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You are a pervert.
Everybody got down on their knees.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
He dropped the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
Maybe it seems weird.
No one can escape death.
That's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody get the door.
- Is this yours?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy is about freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a card to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that what we need?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an ear ache.
Dan hit him on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of the night.
Now's not the time.
You're out of alcohol.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a couch.
I didn't get a response from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do this.
Tom became famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom up to?
A mother's advice would be better than a friend's.
We're not out of danger yet.
Tom is furious.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a moose.
Dan's wanted by the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom is waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I got him.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom's seen worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting my feelings.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop yelling, it's giving me a headache.
You're not gonna tell me what to do, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful view!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get your fill.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm going to get stronger.
This elephant is adored by little children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on some caramel.
She has a picture.
The art of swimming.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very upsetting.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, now!
We're sorry about that.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this place clear?
Bring him to his attention.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
No one wants to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you kept quiet.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy.
I was a traveler.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the melody on the trumpet.
An unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom is a fool.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
It's complicated.
Check the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the jelly.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I was in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human company.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirt so aggressively that women end up running away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, just by chance.
Did you talk to Tom?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is going to hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure is rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has been driving that car for three years.
Can you use peppermint in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the leader.
He saved Tom.
You haven't solved your problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom is very angry.
What situations would you use it in?
Can we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're going to have to do this on your own.
We are all in danger.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom what he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's gun from him.
Look around.
Tom hasn't been back for three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's worried about getting lung cancer.
He studied me a lot.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got a quality one.
Did you find someone to babysit?
I'm not saying anything.
He was chasing the thief.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom giggled in his voice.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not saying anything.
That would be nice.
It's quick on foot.
Tom is very dirty.
I just said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda out of there safe.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm gay. I'm not gay. I'm not gay.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what Tom has prepared for me.
I saw him myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you want me to do.
Tom seems nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There is no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where none exist.
My sister does her hair in the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Rainwater evaporates when it's warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be at school.
I never say anything, even if it makes me nervous.
You're below his level.
I'm not afraid to hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom could recruit Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, air the room.
Tom is still trying to convince Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me get Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay more than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
What are you so upset about?
I think I know how to keep it from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You are a faggot.
What are you up to?
Why are you so mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I'm not afraid to help.
Nobody did anything else.
Sorry to barge in like this.
Books are new.
Thanks for having us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
We got him.
That gave me an idea.
The clock's spindle is broken.
I was asking about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Everybody, follow me.
This is a good parking spot.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't exactly old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do that somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to protect the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
They're a little bad.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's really good.
Let's have a skate.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always gives me a lot of energy.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me. I'm not a cop.
How many gallons of oil does he collect in a storm?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The pear is green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go and find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom was upset.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm going to scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom brushed her hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to be married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just about to start.
His brother's more patient than him.
No one could prove anything.
What's your hobby?
So I'm being serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Do you want me to give you a signal?
You're going to have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you note.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom has returned to Boston.
The light went out.
- What?
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp over.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - it is acquired.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when it's washed.
Truth is the goal, not the destination.
I'm covering for him.
You ever heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I skipped class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it's going to be hard for me to catch fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupted.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol lowers the inhibition.
Tom needs both of us.
I'll tell him to leave right now.
Tom seems confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as a chasm.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little bit more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
- That's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear the air.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom is healed.
Please repeat.
You're being very dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She went to school.
They say Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family begins where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
That's cool.
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You're too busy.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
They voted him mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm really hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's gonna tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come with?
The more I eat, the more my appetite increases.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a dizzy.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this myself.
They've probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me over thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't made of diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What is the answer?
Did I say I'm finished?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd of people gathered.
Is this a better time to talk?
I'm concerned about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is volatile.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm hot. I'm not hot.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it that way.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between Tom and me.
I'm irreplaceable, you know.
Give him a second chance.
I almost cut the sandwich.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the toilet.
I met your girlfriend.
You are my luck.
Take Tom's advice.

I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was thoughtful.

There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
I wouldn't want you to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I've never tried to be anything other than what I am.

I'm going to be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.

I don't want to talk about the weather.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls were teasing her about her clothes.
You're going to be confused.

How are we today?
There's your wife.
He came back at six.
Let them go, people.
Tom didn't blink.
You are a good son.
I'll arrange for you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The lamp has caught her.
I have to turn off the phone.
The weather's good.
This was misinformation.
No one wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to a stranger near the restaurant.

Do you remember what happened last year?
You're coming with me, and that's it!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
It went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
We're doing the best we can.
I'll pay for it.
It's possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit.
Read this.
I got here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
It's blackmail. You know what?
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
Jealousy is a sin.
All the children are strangers.
They shot me.
Tom is not prone to drama.
I finished 25 projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't get out to look through the keyhole.
The tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?

I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?

Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You're the one they're after.
Let's go down the street.
There was no one in the parking lot.

I've got a few minutes left.
Just a little more.

There's no shortcut to the top, only to the break.
Tom is pretty skinny.
Its surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom is getting paid a lot.
It was pathetic.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked everyone.
Automated cars are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there is a problem...
Tom carries chairs.
No matter what you do, you gotta give it your best shot.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The Org was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making a cocoon.
I like the color blue.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography in it, it will be made.
I've been calling for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play the accordion?
Nice pick for her.
What's all this?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a privilege to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little bit of a dick.
The girl ran away from home and freed herself from parental control.
Tom is a waste.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
There was a census in 2005.
I forget where to put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
She's undressed to take a bath.
A river of sweat started to run down my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just knock it off.
I'm teaching math.
The keyboards are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you move?
Movies are a great pastime.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me like the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
They all laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was canceled due to bad weather.
If the universe is the answer, what's the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world is lit by the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get down here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly right.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad company.
The airfield is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom isn't scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The tap is not coming out.
Tom committed suicide.
Tom promised to watch over Mary.
Mary likes hot coffee, and Tom likes soft coffee.
I gave you a fake address.
I'm in my room.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane will come.
I'm such a lazy man.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It matters to me what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom nodded.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What's a lawyer for?
The girls are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom shop?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get out of here.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is, can he or can't he?
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls who were shorter than you.
I have to tighten my belt.
Tom almost collided with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What's upsetting you?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please be on time.
The Germans have a less-than-nothing attitude to nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister is asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Isn't that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they buried his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you take tips?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I was out of luck.
His body was shaved with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in there.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always liked mystery characters better.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic. I'm not going to lie.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I was gonna tell you.
What's the hat scene?
Tom is one of America's greatest songwriters.
It can't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wishes he'd never come back here.
Nobody likes crybabies.
She was crying about a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom is really freaked out.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary a lot.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do better.
You're a fast learner.
We had a very good meal.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one of those.
Look out the window.
Mary bought some stinking trash bags.
I have asthma.
He's used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport is expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How could you make such a mistake?
You have a good memory.
Can he do anything he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Can you give us a lift?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood was robbing the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the boat?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
You've been a great help.
What do you usually do in your spare time?
I'm coming to rescue you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I never lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was bone-brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for my arms.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We just started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't you talk.
They may need our help.
I got some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
Get out of my sight.
It was too late.
I live on the ground floor.
The girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We have to call Tom.
They're going to hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's give him a little time.
I never wear a suit.
The grail is broken.
He's gone. He's been here.
His clientele is mostly poor.
Neither of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's awful.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do that, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People die all the time.
He's got a perfect fit.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He drew his sword.
I can't wait to get to Boston.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom seems a little more left-leaning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where she was.
Tom kicked the bucket.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did he ask them for money?
Keep your voice down.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is abhorrent.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
- Give me the garlic.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking this opportunity to thank her.
Tom isn't very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a loser.
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is complicated.
Tom didn't want to fall.
Tom was suspended.
They were getting confused.
She's going to be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like some pickled fish and seafood.
I was terrified.
Tom looks devastated.
Something is weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that stopped us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're a mess.
He's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom was furious.
It's work.
We'll get through this.
Praise encourages students to work hard.
Tom isn't very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
All right, I'll have it.
We'll work it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two.
Tom weighed himself on the scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked up.
I'm just really proud of you.
At that time, the title dama was only used for noblewomen.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose only one?
I came to feed Tom the fish.
I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My fucking uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger stuck deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be more certain.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
He used to be so funny.
Could you stay a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking about my accent.
You're very specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom is pretty thin.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don't mix work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
He put the crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you to him.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your patent is revoked.
This is one of mine.
Nothing is stopping us.
Tom is sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss off Tom.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not true at all.
The rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done with this.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a bad headache.
As soon as I raised him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank lent the company a million dollars.
I have much more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do everything in my power to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive it myself.
I must have had too much to drink last night, my head's killing me.
Tom was checking out.
Tom said he couldn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna get to your baby.
That was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book I could borrow?
Tom moved cautiously.
Just get in there.
A sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've said my piece.
You are ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When do I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than us.
It's going to be fine.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm really scared.
Dan is furious.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
Here are the rules.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I better call him back.
Tom isn't very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I blew a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where you visited Mary yesterday.
You overreacted!
He has a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show is going to be cancelled; they haven't sold a lot of tickets.
Tom is coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laugh.
Tom paid me.
I like to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom seems silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their own ways.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What do you see here?
I feel like it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You already got yourself a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You are awful.
Where does he live?
Mary is a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a little bugger named Cookie.
Tom is on a business trip.
Tom said he'd water the bathroom.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunder.
Tom wants tea with cinnamon.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom seems nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom knocked him down.
This betrayal will never end!
The glasses are in the glass tray.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to bathe with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet when you ride a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
What do you mean, you're still awake?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to do that again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I burned the trash.
We both saw it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics, there are only two seasons.
I think I made a good statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this wonderful?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just do this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What is Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he could play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Have a seat.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
Here we are looking for them.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would have returned.
She always does the work.
What country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting with Tom.
I like dogs better than cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
It can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any broken money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I made this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it like that.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'm gonna bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
I guess we'll just have to work harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I'm not allowed to tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston, Mom?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to bother him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
They were all talking.
How proud of you.
Tom was looking for drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get you through this.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
- I'm not going to.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was repressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I may be ready to leave soon.
Tom doesn't know how to empathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The crap was getting on my nerves.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm so excited that we're going to get to Pluto soon.
"I see", said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like this?
I have trouble with my sinuses.
I had low expectations for him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom is taking water.
Esperanto does not belong to anyone.
She's a good saw handler.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They've scrapped the plan.
I don't want to lie.
Time is not money. Time is life.
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very nice.
The police are looking for me.
Tom isn't that tall.
It's been raining for a week, more or less.
He's recovering more slowly.
I want a spinning top.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the attic.
Her face was smeared with semen.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you. - Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating an apple.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm really confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything you'd say.
Tom is aspiring to be a teacher.
Have a great week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why are you blaming them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
I don't even know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what he started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
The tire is punctured.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'll get her to mow your lawn.
Tom is good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You are Brooke.
Your boys are pretty handsome.
I know what it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We had lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They've been through the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
It's so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I'm not getting any use out of it.
It's still not raining.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
If this happens again, call me.
Was he sincere?
The jar was empty.
Don't say a word.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I did my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is in jeopardy.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom is wrong.
She hates me running.
I couldn't call you.
Is that true?
I know you're mad.
When I passed by the house, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I take a hot shower, the bathroom mirror gets blurry.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I'm afraid I don't have enough money on me right now.
Are you a vegetarian? No, are you?
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They gave me another raise.
I'm never going back there.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What are we doing today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know how to walk.
I'm making a contribution.
It was a disaster.
Tom is good at his job.
I figured it out.
I'd like to know why they took my name off the list.
Tom set all this up.
I'm not gonna give it away.
The flowers attract bees.
The water's fresh.
Before that, there was no vegetation in this sky.
You're incompetent. You know what?
What was Tom's answer?
You'll do as I say.
Who's going to believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom is very far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, what?
I'm very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not used to it.
She has tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom isn't telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
- Will they arrest me?
Unfortunately, that's breaking all the rules.
What are you doing here, Mom?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura on the line.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's basically right.
I know Tom hasn't been playing fair.
The wound was leaking pus.
No, and it's not under the chair.
I'm a little drunk right now.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be lonely.
What did you search for?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm studying art history.
I don't exactly agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're foreigners.
It is the translator's moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left in the language that produced them.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom's permission.
You look so good.
Think what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal to you?
You want to eat?
I need a box of razors.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems anxious.
It was a sit-down.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun varies constantly.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deeply in the eyes and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- You did?
I can touch the floor with my palms without bending my knees.
Tom is white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You should have found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom is home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We could have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're going for a walk.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom is a schemer.
I just cut my finger.
I'm going to ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive nature.
It's possible someone followed her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in itself.
We went down the coast.
I don't want you to harass them.
It's up to you.
It's feasible.
Tom reacted badly.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
Tom was targeting you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was delighted to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
It smells like flowers.
Tom got fucked.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the master.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
She's good at tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She's slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're the right people for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So, we had a deal, right?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your argument is illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I will never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer is jammed.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom lifted the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You were wrong.
We're so glad to see you.
You may go now, sir.
Maybe it was him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen is green.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
What about evidence?
When we woke up in the morning, we were confronted with terrible news.
The knee wound is now rotting.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom is a farm worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered heavy casualties.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What else are you eating?
You promised to help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They will.
I'm gonna have to stay the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get off here.
We are paranoid.
This is not silver.
A blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare car keys do you have?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy guy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a sea nut.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it's best if I stay here for a while.
Tom reread the note.
The kids were drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering why you've been so long.
Did you get a response from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at 26.
We've already cleared that.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to realize what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you deliver today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to show off the magnificent chandeliers she has in her house.
I'm not a local.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm studying the piano.
They need the money.
She swims well.
You won't find us.
I've been in touch with her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me all the time I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
You think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom mad at me?
Triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read.
Tom is arguing with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary, open the carpet.
Oh, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll have the talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone is waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
You gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me as soon as they're separated.
Mr. Gorbachev, bring down the wall!
Tom looks stunned.
Tom got stuck.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's going to be hard.
I'm not happy about retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are deserted.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter was never meant to be sent.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom will have much to fight for.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for the abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince has inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for a fact.
I've never felt so loving in my life.
I can't control her.
She drives me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll get it now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I haven't gotten a response from them.
Tom doesn't really like me.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will come.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom drives to school.
Did you see it?
I'm gonna have to think this through.
I'm going to buy a calendar.
Everyone is talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
You write the proverbs?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
That's why I do it.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You just gave me a hard time.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night, trying to figure out a plan.
Tom is furious.
Tom will sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
Today is boring TV.
Oh, that's great.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive us too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We stood up to say hello.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be examined.
Where did you get that scar?
You are nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds perfectly valid.
It's the law!
Water penetrates through the rock.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any complaints from customers.
I like challenges.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very much like Tom.
Tom isn't my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom was cuddling Mary all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I dream about you all the time.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not telling anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's get the soul together.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam soon.
We're headed for Boston.
Tom is a good father.
Stay here, all right?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately on the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three cans of bug spray.
It was gross.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these medicines for my dad.
The kids love cake.
He was pretty restrained.
I can handle Tom.
Tom is nervous.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, which number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary saved Tom all the money.
Enough of this bullshit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to howl.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got off work early.
We have everything.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You've been right all along.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments do you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are probably fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unchallengeable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
Tom and I are engaged.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom woke up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak eye.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't shoot in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
- Is it ready?
Everyone wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe wasn't too happy to have a peacemaker.
Open up.
Put your coat on.
You could be wrong.
I baked a cake anyway.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what subjects to take.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom right now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Does Dan know what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room below?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do that so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice guy.
I never change my sleep schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, get in here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something into Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I saw it happen.
We're going to miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're being very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or is it just me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom is probably in the kitchen.
Tom is back.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We are mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I have to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was exciting.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They pitched their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on that spot.
- What?
You want cheese?
I'll call her.
He gets tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not bright at all.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them kill you.
Secure is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay well.
Tom probably went out.
We didn't fight.
Tom stood inside.
You're both heavy and light, and pleasant and hot; I can't live with you or without you.
Let's just say for now you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's warm in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom is a backward.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget about it.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a blanket.
Tom will kill you.
We should both get some sleep.
I always confuse those two names.
Tom is wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very fuzzy.
You should help them.
Tom didn't cry.
She wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom rolled the dice.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about that, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more regrettable than stupidity and indifference.
Everybody's pissed off.
Tom didn't protest.
What are websites made of?
Vampires live forever. They're not supposed to die.
They both laughed.
What's that in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're very sympathetic.
I hate the patties.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon he won't be able to get out of bed.
You want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
How far is it to Boston?
I'm paid to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the lid out of the bottle.
Tom will be there, too.
There's a guard coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't keep me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the pole.
The roses symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You are a traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enja's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now that's over.
I'm going to sleep.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a link between personality and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom is a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing a computer game.
You may be right.
What do you got?
This is a men's product.
We've been looking everywhere.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Push the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
You got the keys?
Tom tore up his car.
You have to overcome the obstacles.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
He's going to do something.
I think Tom is rude.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You seem disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see the situation.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30.
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions can't tell the difference between colors.
That wasn't right.
The answer is messed up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're so far from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look this way.
I want my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are now married.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can imagine you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that his wallet was gone.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm running pus in my right ear.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We are in real danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to learn.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What kept you up last night?
They put a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be so funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter thanking her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turtles live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom is very sound asleep.
Are you helping him?
She looks drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I can feel it.
Did you drive here?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's over for us.
I'm sure you will.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call?
The question is who's going to make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start it again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the egg to the underground.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for the crazy.
Why would I help him?
Tom lightened his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I bothering you?
End the violence; fight for peace.
Watch me do this.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hold on to it, Tom.
That's very kind of you.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They'll be very fond of that.
I'm a faggot.
I'll see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should check.
It's time for dinner.
I'm going after him.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax. I'm not going to lie.
Tom had one daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sneaking up on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in, you.
Is there someone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses every month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're overstating the problem.
Have you paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom sharpened his face.
What good are you to me?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when she wears that dress.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
It wasn't funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They live on the floor below this one now.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't budge.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a species of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is smiling at you.
I think I'm gonna go out to eat.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit his baby.
I underlined the word "Alice" to emphasize it.
Third chance.
We should get going.
This is airy pasta is popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
To pursue the virtues and renounce the vices.
You're the smart one.
I'm against the project.
- You weren't tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm the one who's a zombie!
I was too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is pretty harmless.
There are reports to write.
It hurts here.
You're scaring Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just stomping on you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You hit a button.
Diseases often come at the most inopportune times.
A dog stared at me like it was going to eat me.
They were beasts in human skin, and they weren't real people at all.
The man is hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
It's all fleeting, but the good memories stay.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What was Tom thinking?
It was really nice.
Everyone dies at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We like beauty.
I think about her all day.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous structure.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it so much!
Is this in English correct?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like a peacock.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not being rude.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom backed off.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are rusty.
Maybe we can find something.
You look really good.
You made Tom unhappy.
Heat it up.
Tom seemed to be resentful.
What else can Tom do?
I want to become stronger both physically and mentally.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to walk.
Do you have a map of Boston?
I hope you didn't fall off.
I got a nine on the chemistry test.
You were lucky to survive the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was talkative.
How was the game?
I'm a student.
I'm going to be all right.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm going to take Tom for a walk.
I don't like being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your wheel unturned.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I didn't ask you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do something.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Headlines should capture the attention of the reader.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than surrender.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French movie with English subtitles.
Tom laughed at Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illnesses are false.
Dan had a turbulent relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us back.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which would Tom choose?
The hospital there isn't very big.
Most people have to work to make ends meet.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We're going to stay.
I don't bother their dog.
I didn't sleep well.
I don't want to and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys at the age of eleven to twelve.
It's on.
Tell Tom he mustn't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will soon be clear.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I'm not allowed to tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was gifted.
Epton was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door locked?
I got a big propeller.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants rebelled against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't back down when you get home.
Tom taught me to sing.
What book are you reading?
You burn the car.
That gun is not a toy, boy!
Half the species are female.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't you dare speak ill of me.
I want to do community service to make up for all I've done.
Tom tied his laces.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in several different ways, which I should have taken into account in the translation.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are the wasps poisonous?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying to yourself, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a college party.
Mary was very supportive.
Tom is in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're being a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom doesn't care.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who picked Tom.
Tom knows Bunton.
You've seen what I can do.
We got a lot of money.
Does it look age-appropriate?
Can I have it?
It's not all honey and milk in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom got carried away.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is poor.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
Hawks have a sharp eye.
I wrote that for them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom was honking.
We need a new rug.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom politely smiled.
The teacup is pretty messy.
You need to get some sleep.
Tom took off his helmet.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather on his mother's side.
I want specific information.
Friendships are magical.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How's that gonna help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The little island looks like a turtle from a distance.
Do the oysters bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop being such a dick.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait up.
You don't know how long.
The dog was barking.
Let's go to the movies.
Happy women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He knocked him out.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what's upsetting Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom is a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
It's not a problem.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom is unnecessarily shy.
You deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking figs.
You think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the words?
It hurts like hell here.
I hate carpet.
I'm a little sick, you know?
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm going to get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's not natural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom is replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
But you're smart.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's pissed off.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom was my friend.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're wasting your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The death is coming back.
Tom filled the bucket to the top.
Choose your weapon.
They've elected a new government.
I'll wash the dishes. Okay, I'll wipe them.
I would buy it.
He's the one who's dragging himself behind.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom is wet.
They tried to raise their wages.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was going to be here?
The earthquake started the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't eaten, I'd really like to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would've said something.
The grill has stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon.
- See you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
It's entirely possible.
I don't know how to do that yet.
It's like a subterfuge.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom thinks we don't want to go.
We believe in democracy.
- You got it?
My day was full of activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's got the flu.
I'm not waiting too long.
Just look at you.
This is great.
It's missing an empty space between the two points.
Tom lives on this street.
You should see a dentist.
The soldiers were firing.
Tom can't stand that.
The store is closed.
They listened.
Tom went outside.
This is all I can do.
He's sticking to his principles.
Tom is upset.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They broke it.
Tom is a great quote.
Can I put this here?
I didn't see anybody.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm asleep now.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
He's throwing himself like a jackal.
You have to pay your rent in advance.
Put all the garbage in the stove.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's about time.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
- Are you going to change your mind?
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at a desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't speak so fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off your mask.
That's one option.
You can go anywhere.
I blame myself.
I like the way you dance.
I need you for a while.
We were tricked.
Tom is the one right there.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate.
Now you've ruined it.
She's white.
You're sitting down.
Iron is harder than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
The condors are teasing me.
Tom didn't say anything about it.
That's probably true.
We had to walk home after the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Every color has a meaning.
The old house was in a bad state.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom wasn't sleeping well.
I cried.
He called me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go and wake Tom up.
How am I supposed to find him?
The ice is melting.
I spat out blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
That must be a relief.
I never got caught.
I love my country.
I haven't learned to write.
They're stopped.
Tom can handle that.
Don't be a witch.
Tom is comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They look at themselves in the mirror.
I'm not born to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom sent Mary to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two are all against me!
I've never worn a sleeping bag in my life.
Don't sleep in the tub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm studying music.
I didn't go that bad.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you count us.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'm going to send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's nice to be home.
It's not that bad.
They're flying away.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand it.
It's sunny today, but cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary have been on our asses since day one.
Let's get out of here.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
You're not gonna eat the spinach? I'll eat it later.
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off his helmet.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom isn't that tall.
She wears a leather belt on her collar.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom greeted Mary.
I'll go and look for them.
Tom came in spite of the rain.
I don't want to use a dildo. I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We play on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
The only way you can stay is if you keep quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom beat me up.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
He's not fighting.
I'm expecting your help.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only got A's in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are pure.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
It was great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The dentist installed a temporary seal.
Tom actually laughed.
Tom is allergic to pollen.
They've contacted local politicians.
Tom takes notes.
They gave me this map.
We'll have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I have the apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom is weird.
That was very nice.
My dad gives me a $10 a week allowance.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe. I'm glad you're not in the middle of this.
How long have you worked for them?
I need to help Tom.
Tom may know French.
Tom is silencing me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with your elbow, isn't it?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over to our place and help us move the keyboard.
Tom used to be shy.
It's all cool.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I'm not going to lie.
I'm looking for you.
You want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is biting itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of brown sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The scarf has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I suspected so.
Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What are you cooking for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little bit?
I'll leave first.
Tom is now thirty years old.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a grandmother just a few days before her 99th birthday.
Did you search everywhere?
It's important to remember that nobody is ever 100% anything.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm really happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1633. However, because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who laugh more often live longer than those who are run over by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom cut down the tree.
The land is still watered, and the sword will probably be dropped.
I was having a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog followed me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom left.
She's working her way up to being an actress.
My plastic bottle is broken.
Is this our cabin?
Let's get this thing going.
We're too sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's brilliant.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little red.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We have to help her.
Tom stood silent.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
- You live here?
This room looks like a brake.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom is a fussy businessman.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to leave and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
The peaches are soft.
It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
The muskets fall from the tree.
Do you have a band?
You can wait here.
Gained an A in French.
I want the class to shut up.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
What's the fastest way from here to the post office?
I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
You still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you gonna wear a mask this year?
I'll do whatever you want.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door is closing.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I long for him.
She's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember.
Tom noticed how Mary was looking at him.
You're really pushing me.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice guy.
The eagle is king of birds.
I'll call you back.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's have a chat.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky is excited.
The noise will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not exactly something a man should be preparing for.
Tom and Mary are playing rummy.
I made my decision.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call for security.
You think Tom would prefer a son.
How did you get here?
She picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to do that.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
He's got an appetite from the long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom had a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom asked me not to.
They both laughed again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strongly.
The meeting has already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the look of your hair.
Is it cold out?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest boy in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in the paper today?
I just don't want this to happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased a long time.
We can't go into that now.
Why are you blaming me?
- I'm not going to.
I'll try to make it in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking muddy water can cause illness.
We're pretty much ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bought them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
He's not comfortable with me.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the lid off.
I helped him unpack the table.
I had a slice of compost last night.
It's better for your health to walk up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is disgusting.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't be asking you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at 2:30.
Tom is sleeping.
I slept in the gutter.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Don't you feel cold with short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any bad Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was originally slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them a cake.
The fingerprints on the knife establish her guilt.
Can I wait for them here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go and find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded the schedule you sent me to Tom.
It's not expensive.
It's such a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have had a lot of fun if we'd gone to the party.
Save the bell.
He hit me in the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems distracted.
You're slowing down, you're getting younger.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
What do you mean, you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
The meat smells bad.
So I should know you?
Tom cleverly covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing without a clue.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just cleared Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell a dog if it was taller.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son is a big fan of rockets.
You need to hurry.
They all talk.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a jerk.
We despise her.
You got there before them.
Here, brother, half of it.
Tom put on the table the new fly he had just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is a bit of a jerk.
The scenery is magnificent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't go in there.
We should test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to keep it together.
Autumn has arrived.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
It only takes three minutes to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the intent?
Tell me where to find him.
You are drunk!
It was just magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer that question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in a spirit of common humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
This soup is too salty.
What, you're not going to pick it up?
Tom continued to practice.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Is that a yes or a no?
Tom fired into the tunnel.
How can you be my friend?
It looks familiar.
I envy you.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
There are limits to everything.
With all the noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, cloves, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We are lazy.
You're a very insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I'm not getting paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I can keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm flattered at least.
I'm working out.
She may have lied to you, but she didn't lie to me.
Let's just catch the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They bit me.
Tom reached into the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a dump.
It's just to solve this problem.
They need to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's really fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
This weekend, if you can.
I know how likely that sounds.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good to go.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to be stung by a catfish.
We import grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom is gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help with the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem like a good idea to ask Tom.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the composted beans calorie-dense?
They'll get it soon.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the rope.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go and ask him.
You're lucky I didn't keep you waiting.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I want to make a face.
I waited outside.
You are impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was throwing a rock at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's Tom so mad about?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last.
They were standing under the curtain outside the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I should break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice coat.
I like your coffee.
They're all split.
I still think about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called The Russians Are Coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary missed school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Is Tom still unable to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying for it.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at this.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
You got enough?
Gophers are carriers of plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom is a little bit of a jerk.
I start tomorrow.
I wasn't honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I'm not that good at writing.
The King did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm pissed off at Tom.
I want roasted bones.
What was Tom doing here?
He fell asleep driving and caused a traffic jam.
We were strangled.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was just wonderful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's all right.
Tom seems concerned.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't overdo it with us.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so wonderful.
I don't understand English, and I don't understand German.
It'll take us about three hours to get down the mountain.
I'm just starving to death.
I was disqualified.
Are you finished packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You care too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you that book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be a dessert.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds pretty cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this the place?
You want to stop?
Watch your step, Tom.
Tom tied his laces.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America did not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom is not listening to us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is that what all the excitement was about?
Tom decided somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm went off.
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm going to stay here.
I wonder why they picked him.
That's a fact.
- Is that good?
Watch your step!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a good man.
Tom frowned a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom gave himself up to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
The survivors are a species of mammal.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll test his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the bull going?
I wiped my wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You're going to be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took out a scraper from the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the screen.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do whatever I can.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was remarkable.
I like life.
Tom isn't in his bed.
This whole thing was my idea.
I don't want any riddles.
This book will help you write.
This area is in a valley.
You really want to stay till Monday?
I thought you'd be free.
That's not so bad.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
Please, air the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary on the left.
I'm really making my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on the planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom threw out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's excited.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Watch the count.
I'm impressed with your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom choked himself.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hey, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'm going to take the shield off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have a theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you, too.
I wonder why we got married.
What good is that to us?
I'm with the man I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see much.
How are you?
Mary was a wonderful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Hold on a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a rhetorical phrase.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll figure out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We did nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want the spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has many good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom is not good at sports.
Shouldn't we help them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to make amends.
It's a hand job for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom raised the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not on your side.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not friends.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He's got the dog with a rock.
Tom stared persistently.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
So you wrote that book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be fancy.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must dig it up.
Tom isn't feeling well today.
We're not watching.
Mahmoud is not a dengue.
No one listens to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for it now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are torn.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make it uncomfortable for you.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I said yes.
Tom admitted to pouring the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
You ever heard of us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little further up.
I think about him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I haven't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just grab my arm.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get involved in that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very thorough in his work.
Come on in the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I have to do a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and see a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You have very piercing eyes.
Does that not make sense?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom go back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty good.
You going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Just smoke and get in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems reliable.
Do you want a drink of water?
Tom is not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four angles.
I kept working.
He's become addicted.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and remained silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary threw herself at her mother.
Pick one of them.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the Mass.
Tom wiped the knife blade off his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your nails bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer crayon on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gives me a seductive look.
Don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Are you coming down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda convinced Dan he was cheating on her.
Why would that stop them?
Let's not bother Tom.
The scar is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave yourself.
I need to get us out.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It just went over my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression at various times in his life.
- Can I grab your wrists?
I'd trust it with my life.
I'm kind of hungry right now.
I'll give it a shot.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is wild.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called the Slasher.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move your ass.
I'm not speaking fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom is not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town outside of Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did he mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She's studying English.
With a dream this big, he'll either be a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They start beating her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even speak to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We came to apologize.
We're going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom licked the chewing gum.
Let it be my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for having me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to get into bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won't pay the money back.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she became interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think would know the answer?
What's next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
What do I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad about this.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do as he pleased.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary is Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn the lights off.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a pain in the ass.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom has a neck injury.
Grab the day.
What's that, Tom?
He's very handsome.
Beware the buyer.
Tom often runs away from classes.
Now it's time for a payback.
Most virgins have a hymn.
You can get out of it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I feed the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was delayed, we waited for a long time for the rain.
You'll be all right.
Is there a dog?
I'm tired of it.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he really did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the lecture. The speaker should have spoken slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Just relax for a second.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
The bread is moldy, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fushersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked nervous.
Please, tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm the one who decides, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's working fine.
Tom got really sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait for him here?
Enjoy your day.
Tom just got disconnected.
I prefer goat cheese to cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy products in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was the plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was awful.
The carpenters are cutting wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I need.
Where were you born?
Go all the way.
Same-sex couples shouldn't be allowed to marry.
The cow forgets she was once a calf.
Let them take a picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm really confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister take the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out the cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's that girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign or voice from Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me around.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's have a talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies lead to more lies.
I don't have any more money.
The table is plastic.
Sunlight is supposed to be the best disinfectant.
You're getting a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're all tied up.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
You lifted me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
Tonight, after lunch, we plan to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light's on.
John's at the airport.
Tom should have been ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
It's the first snow today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulating through the body.
I'll get him to go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where are we coming from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a scarf?
Tom is baking for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, much less Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really think about that sort of thing.
There's a wind.
I'm just messing with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.

But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm 12 years old.
I'm focusing.

You were right, boys.
It happens.
There were no other injuries.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you can handle it.
Are you eating at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.

She didn't show.
I'll give it to you.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems by keeping these tips in mind.

Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin it.
You're very passionate.
My headache is gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handcuff.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?

What are you up to?

When's my turn?
Tom failed.

The baby is asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.

Tom seems pretty proud of himself.
Nobody really knows.

Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was three corners away.

It was a tough test.
It's hot in hell here.
I saw that.
This is your doing!

It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was at stake.
I wish I hadn't.
Let me help you with that.

Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
You enjoy it?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you at the trunk.
It's nice of him to bring presents like this.

Visitors are welcome.
Could you describe it in a few words?

I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.

Put it down.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?

Well, it's not a rush.
Tom won't know what to do.

You would have done the same thing if you were me.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't you talk to me like that!
I smiled at myself.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I've been happy for days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop lying to each other.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.

Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.

It's written on his face.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done that without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
Dan spent the night getting drunk at a butcher's.
I'm in there.

The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom practices the violin for at least half an hour every day.

I use this.

I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to sunbathe yourself.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely audible.
Don't be such a dick.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom is guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom is good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I'm telling you to lean in.
The real story is a little different than what you told me.
It was your mistake.
The balloon was slowly descending.
Who wants bugs?
It sucks.

My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew immediately that something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures mean nothing to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.

I'll go and ask them.
Tom doesn't look like his brother at all.
Tom was different.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
There's no way Tom could have done that by himself.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.
I have a chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.

It doesn't look much different.
It's all over.

You better let me do it.
This house is better than the other one.
Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm at the end.
Marry me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun shines at night.
No one's getting fired.
There is no one else.
On my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on the bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught a mist.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
The one who pays the bills has the right to be the master.
You are very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedy happens every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm getting it right.
Give me those papers.
You can have mine.
Tom won't like that.
All comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them help?
Tom rubbed his mouth.
It smells like cheese.
Tom is not deluded.
The patient is suffering from hallucinations.
Why is it so important that we be there today?

We know him.
I've been sitting there for hours.
Tom had a drink in his hand.
What a pair.
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have been troubling me.
I'm not wearing anything.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I guess you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom is quite talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom is crazy.
I'm going and that's it.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom is cooperating.
The snow is a foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom has been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's licking the fuse.
I'm going to go find Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This should do it for now.
They should talk.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It's not that you weren't right.
Tom obeyed immediately.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without hardship.
You got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me an asshole.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open to page nine.

Don't whistle or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the ends of the earth.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely happy with Tom's explanation.
You're probably right.
He ran away from being caught.
You know, you mean nothing to me anymore, Mary!
Tom is still not back.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?

Love me a little, love me a lot.

Tom is not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Are you panicking?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom is sensitive.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big.
We're going back.
Is there anyone else?
That's good news, though, because it means that not all people are bad.
Isn't that exciting?
Tom came to ask for help.
They're easy to talk to.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of punctuation marks is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.

That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had woken up already.
You want a ride home?
That house is built of bricks.
We've come to no conclusion.
Tom arrived about 2:30.
Doesn't sound like much.
Tom tried to escape.
I have a cat flu.
The crowd was clapping.
I leave the pieces to grow on the stripes.
I think Tom is mean.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'm gonna make a few calls.
What are you looking at now?
The garbage is broken.
I was too tired to continue.
Everything has a sound.
What the doctor thinks is wrong.
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't joking.
It's written on his forehead.
I got a call last night from a guy named Tom Jackson.

How negative you are.
We still haven't found Tom.
I need the Internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.

You beat her.
The stars have appeared.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I play volleyball a lot.
Where's that shirt I bought you?
That'll teach them to order.
I have to sit down.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like this.

You look beautiful.
Wash yourself.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I get something to eat?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent. He's going to be fine.
I won't bother you.
Stay here and watch her.
Wouldn't you start getting your hair cut from that?
How are you gonna escape?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg is broken.
How will you accomplish that?
I took Tom to lunch.
We are Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd be interested to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these from my grandmother.
I have no problem with drinking.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I wondered who it was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's not right.
It's in great shape.
I grabbed Tom by the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard all about them.
I have to help them.
How far is it from here?
I can't die in here.

I think I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have had so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.

I'm late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?

Tom might need a little help.
He went to church every day.
Tom was a teacher.
He would be broken.

Did the dishwasher work?
Tom is a married man.
Like Tom said, the soup is too salty.
Did I miss much?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a fan?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That is huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What's this about?
You're gonna have to study part-time next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are algae in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
No one likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
- What?
I should have asked them first.
Tom may be a little fat.
I'd rather die than do what you want.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?

I'll send you the prescription.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Pick the one you like best.

They got addicted.
I just want money.
I don't say mean things about their kids.
I want to know why you and Tom aren't getting along.

Let's do it now and that's it.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mom put your collage in the top drawer.
You got in a traffic jam, but you'll be fine.

Who broke it?
The line is short.

I want to take you somewhere where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't believe I bought this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier in the morning.
Get up for once, you lazy one!
How long ago was that?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd avoid Tom for a while.
I'm not gonna wait to find out.
Let's continue this conversation outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.

I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did you wake up?
I'm in love with you.

Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him. She hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom is already here.
They seem busy today.
I'm sure Tom has never been to Boston.
I think I should call Tom.
Just give it your best shot.

Tom is suspicious.

It's good training.
This capital is peculiar.
I should have said no.

I've lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my lib.
I know you did your best.
Tom shouldn't have written his password on the inside of the notebook cover.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should feel sorry for them.
I'm not cutting myself.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guests.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is a bullet.
I want to live in Brazil.

Keep Tom busy.
They're just words.
There was a brief silence.

I'm with the plan.
Justice is expressed by deeds.

Sorry about yesterday.
Go while you still can.

Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner in the square.
Didn't anyone tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of the tree.
Tom told Mary that he never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you catch a boyfriend.
It was extraordinary.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm on my way.
I was half asleep.
Do not expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom will get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something's biting me.
Don't you ever suspect anything?

You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran for the moon.
Let's go have lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend home was fully equipped, with a pool, a stall, a soccer field, and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you around.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
He was annoying his sister while she was eating pizza.
We should have given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
Why are you doing this?
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heating.
We're all the same.
I want to be with you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
This sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to bend over.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I'm not gonna get in the way.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom is in bed talking on the phone.
These are great.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We are lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need a carrier to move them.
The noise has disturbed the whole town.
A man who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This is not a fuck-up.
They blinked.
You are evil.
Did you give Tom the note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was there an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Tom was stuttering.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears a suit.
Tom was the boss.
That is ugly.
There may be discussions about that.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem. This is my problem.
I took three cold pills before I went to bed.
Tom may be wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom is acting like a spoiled brat.
It's too bad you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First, you're not allowed to jump to conclusions, and second, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems bored.
I raise cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you around.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom in on it?
The thief has disguised himself as a policeman.
We'll let Tom try it.
That would make sense.
I'm going to wash my hands.
Pick one of them.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and rejected.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom is no longer visible.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park by herself.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They've completely renovated the building's facade, and when I drove by, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll work on this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's only fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children sat in circles on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It will not be easy to accomplish this without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
Give him a sedative.
This is not relevant.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing can happen to us.
There I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm going to get a divorce.
That dinner.
My pressure is leaking.
You're going to get a mustache.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser spews hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
Belkim, you're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I have no home to return to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want that.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he'd buy himself a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be nice to older people.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother first.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
What brought you to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're a lot of chicken.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take my picture.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had lunch in a hurry.
Tom remembered things that no one else could.
You can tell them apart easily.
I'll go and look for her.
Of all the languages I learned, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Keep this.
Should I go?
Boy looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a pity?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have fried goose with pickles.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
You're being specific.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to both of you.
I'm going to lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We're not drinking enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'm going to be fine.
I ran into something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a wonderful catch.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Was he home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'll go and find another one.
I'm starving to death.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make a spider.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom doesn't always have to believe what the other person says.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom is funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom shudders in pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're in a jam!
I think that's the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'm going to do when I retire.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we eating?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound fades.
Who did your hair?
I don't really understand myself.
Tom is a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
That's a police car.
She knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom is a good friend to you, isn't he?
Say you understand.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom going to get in?
There's someone at the door.
Tom wasn't going away.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think I can nod.
- You're on your way.
Peter might need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom likes to swim.
I'm going to scream.
I'm not your bitch.
What's our status?
Do you want me to hold it?
You're such a man-eater.
Boston is a beautiful place.
Who's responsible?
I'm serious about this.
I think we better not drink this water.
No one is talking.
What made you contact them?
There's nothing to be done.
You got anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want to be treated differently than I was before.
They should be fine.
I followed the rules.
Tom is a widower.
I think Tom is heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already did.
You were poor.
Give me another shot.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He wore a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He entertained himself by listening to music.
Try on your shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom did not accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he was going to start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan did a very good job.
My legs are still hurting.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
I may have passed out.
It's hard to judge his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to anything.
I used to watch you.
Stay where you are.
Are you cheating on her?
She likes music, doesn't she?
The barber is silent.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm going to get lost.
The nurse gave her a flu shot.
Did you try talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why do I never win?
Tom fell down a ladder while cleaning his toilets.
You got anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the songs were good except yours.
I don't think Tom will be in school tomorrow.
This way, please.
We will wait patiently.
Tom is a little pale.
Next year, my birthday is on a Sunday.
They all laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote the messages?
Tom makes clams.
Tom was breathing deeply.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been in a cave?
Dan didn't want to go back to an orphanage.
We can start tonight.
He is a liar.
Tom is waiting outside.
It's nice to feel needed.
You'll never know.
I still think about him.
I thought I was being punished.
Tom seems lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing looks more like a lunatic than a drunk.
Take Tom with you.
Tom started to undress.
I know Tom is suffering.
It looks good.
We stayed in Boston.
This is almost working.
I can't concentrate with all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
They're smiling at him.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't that wait?
They will pay for their arrogance.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions for you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you help.
I heard him.
We're searching the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me that he'd like me to visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm going to miss them all.
This is where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years and got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
Do you want to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom is listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together again.
After the fire, all that was left was ashes.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write poetry.
We're going to take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm willing to make it up to you.
Humans cannot perform miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to expel him from their company.
Those who confuse the verb endings -θ and -θ have a special place in hell.
What happened next?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
It seems to be everywhere.
I didn't count on it.
I was careless.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to cut myself.
Tom started cleaning.
We are very angry.
Tom isn't that old.
Everybody knows how to drive.
Tom found two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom left a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I've decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish phrases for the entire month.
That was awful.
We're glad you're here.
You earned something.
It's really gross.
You want some cheese?
They say that the sweet potatoes contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is pure and godly.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'm going to be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join you.
Tom jumped forward.
Tom keeps his car in good repair.
You are interesting.
This time I can win.
All people on earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right, sometimes I'm wrong.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set up.
You need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Tom doesn't go shopping.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What is that?
Can people really be so brilliant as to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks a Caucasian language that has no common phonemes or letters with English, can master English completely in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our efforts were in vain.
There's so much I don't know.
He had a breathing problem.
Tom is good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the crazy one.
Tom was laughed at.
Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.

Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work on the weekends?
Which one's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is the right guy for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't he fix the pump?
Isn't that a lovely sound?
This isn't Tom's first time being late.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students have gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to get rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Clean up the mess.
Blood is flowing through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom is bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not a musician, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned the hard way.
I showed my friends the fake.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you here alone?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that forest?
Tom is too emotional.
I'm too short.
I'm sorry about that.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm fed up.
He was eating lettuce.
I'm going for a run.
Tom chews something.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck in the water.
Tom never visited Boston.
I like being independent.
Tom is quite popular.
I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you came back.
I'll get the ice.
Come and see.
Do you think you're attractive?
Innocence is often a blessing rather than a virtue.
Tom's pulse is elevated.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That's a very common mistake.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She kept on talking about how the boyfriend was kind, compassionate, brave, and I don't know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go and eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom believes in Mary.
It's a busy place.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom is watching television.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
It's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in the '80s.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I'm getting a little uncomfortable with the heteroregulatory propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold out much longer.
A merit is a reward in itself.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We should advertise on TV.
Tom nodded inaudibly.
They're not gonna help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing is right.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This candle is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
I've got all this stuff waiting for me.
Is it a real diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems much more sleepy.
I made mushroom cookies yesterday.
I hope he succeeds.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in the science!
Although the rain worm has both male and female reproductive systems, it needs another individual to reproduce.
Failure embarrassed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
No smoking in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The surface temperature of the sun is thought to be about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd is going crazy.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him up.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'll have Tom test it.
It was a disgrace.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
Tom may have gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom is very smart.
Where did Tom want to eat?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom turned him down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was awful.
This must be yours.
We're just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are adult cigars.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavalier would never do something like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
Sorry to have wasted your time.
That was unconscionable.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't play the Toshi.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check in with you later.
Is there any food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I would say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant then.
Tom never gave up hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
Under what circumstances would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold.
Luckily, the hole is stable, otherwise last night's storm would have knocked it down.
I heard they caught her.
Tom has it all written down somewhere.
There is no good news.
And who are you working for these days?
I'm going to quit.
Maria's eyes lit up with pleasure.
It's bad to whine.
I only have a minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom is conservative.
How are you guys doing?
I'd like a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaining.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's being mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom is going to Boston.
I have dinner plans with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple thing.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and came to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Do you want to go out to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
It all seems so pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why aren't you singing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn't know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was an honor to be asked to give the talk.
Tom is not a sports fan.
I'm worried, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Announce your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I love trying new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom is not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll make it quick.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a taxi.
He worked miracles.
The glands release chemicals into the body.
It wasn't my idea.
Tom is resting.
Don't run around.
You better not talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was helping.
Music is what unites.
This is just a simulation.
It's good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's being overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get in here!
You could have said no.
Why don't you let me help?
It's going to happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here, get me out before I suffocate.
It's gonna happen what it's gonna happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom was going to say.
Is Tom alone there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Julia.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was decent.
I guess I'll just have to wait a little longer.
You can either leave or stay - however you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where's the meeting?
Let's play truth or dare.
His conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I passed out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom isn't very nice.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you to be in danger.
I'm fat. I'm not fat.
How much time do you spend on the computer?
My wife is sick of the daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amphibians are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You are crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more resilient.
I'm all right.
He was walking in front of me.
Give it back to me.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not fair to me.
It's possible someone followed them.
Tom may go to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a safe.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come over?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
She just left.
The kids were so excited about the party they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was harsh on her adoptive father.
An international language would be very useful to mankind.
I was helping them.
Have you decided yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's a good person.
What time is it?
Have a great weekend.
Do you want some soda?
Tom nodded to the girls.
We were having a terrible time.
Tom seems different today.
Throw them off deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's very upsetting.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the monasteries.
Don't be such a pervert!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your pay.
Sorry, I'm calling the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom has small hands.
It's bothering me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included math, physics, and chemistry.
Tom laundered money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
So you said you could swim, right?
Don't put any pressure on Tom.
I was betrayed.
And he takes the paper.
Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving your speech.
This sentence has five words.
She had lamb chops, pickles and mushroom soup for dinner.
We waited outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom is doing right now.
It's her.
That's not an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You are a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor is examining the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
Smoke rises in the air.
The printer's not working.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom is a bully.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We could order a pizza.
Tom is much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We drink water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the competition.
Tom doesn't like a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm the only one.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'm going to kill you.
Most people have a strong resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I was watching Tom.
Who's in there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing is good enough for Tom.
Tom went mad.
It wasn't very good.
The mechanics should know about oils and lubricants for engines.
How was yesterday?
You have to learn the value.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's get to work.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They beat you, didn't they?
I totally forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at 10:30.
I don't know where it went.
A boy came running to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I made it.
Tom stayed calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic building blocks of living things.
They're keeping her entertained.
I should go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbabu died the day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
I'm claustrophobic. I'm not going to lie.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
For all you know, I don't care.
No, I'm still a fighter.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is the job we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you imagine when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I totally misjudged her.
It'll be ready in a minute.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom Archy.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the seed.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They painted the windows yellow.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad you did.
I feel like I've screwed up.
We have to wait here.
Are you all right?
Does that sound familiar?
How much do you want?
Tom is losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
No one talks about them.
Has Mike stopped drinking?
You and I are flying the same plane.
Tom is not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom is not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does it start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour to the event.
You were amazing.
I'm not gonna give up until I find out who's responsible.
The alarm went off.
The bird picked up the branch with its claw and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom is not the same man he was three years ago.
Everyone smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom is pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow morning.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom struggled to break free.
What am I going to be?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
Now's not the time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
Tom ran past Mary.
I got scratched by a cat.
Tom is not an old man.
The question is how did Tom do it.
I swear it was them.
Did he have a bathing suit?
His nose is his best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's a powerful one.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question of who.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I'm feeling guilty.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is a snorer. In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're a lot of talk.
We want more money.
You can't lose it.
Do you get along with your folks?
Tom wants something done.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
You don't trust us, do you?
I pay my respects.
Have mercy.
Let's follow the others.
I listen to music before I go to sleep.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Did you have a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Let me see your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should make it a habit to brush your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom collected the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the King's most trusted adviser.
Did you buy this for her?
Go and change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where did you get that?
Tom is an excellent doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I getting?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept going up.
Tom might be able to burn your car down.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He lied to my face.
I'm going to go find her.
I wanted to leave.
They listen.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
They'd only get in Tom's way.
Maybe I should help her.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I memorized it.
I have nothing to give you.
They found a secluded beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on the street.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's about you.
That's a very contradictory explanation.
Walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, I could easily read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
No answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's as simple as that.
I'm coming for her.
Tom had his shirt on the side.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was great!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, division is not.
I'm getting cold feet.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
It's draining our oil.
I don't think Tom is going.
Whose manuscript is this?
Did you see what was in the papers today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom giggled loudly.
It was Better.
Tom started to cry.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a while longer.
We keep two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Tom may be dead by dawn.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was crazy.
The lime is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why were you pretending to hear about Tom the first time?
Tom relaxed his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The money's got my glasses all blurry.
So, no, it was not.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all waved for her.
Didn't you see the lead flag?
- You need to relax.
I told you it would be hard to do.
I think I found one.
You're going to try, aren't you?
Tom went without food for a week.
I don't understand you.
Though I am a godly man, I am a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so mad at me.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing what Mary is doing.
We have to test something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are your breasts?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm shot!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary silenced him.
We met in the meana.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
The nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom is not a member.
It seems our job is to keep that from happening.
Why is the universe black?
I got it wrong.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
I baked you eternal bread.
The marzipan pigs are not burying us.
Tom came to.
Tom pissed off Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at that.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't distinguish between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't knock me out.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do this one time.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got up there at 11:00.
You can ask me anything you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it's from another dimension.
They bore me.
What's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't get her joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom dead?
Did you find out his name?
It doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me give Tom a message.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We are not criminals.
The bread is made from wheat.
- Get your hands off me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'm going to go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's get back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'm going to eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are so cute together.
You look so beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
I may very well be wrong.
What is luck?
Dan hurt Linda's dog. He was a little bit off.
You chewed your collarbone playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show is over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
You really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was impudent.
This is not an easy decision.
It fulfilled the prophecy.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom follows a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom moaning.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you didn't know how to play the piano?
It's time to close.
Let me take care of him.
The stone was pushed down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom is absolutely crazy.
Let's do it again!
It's not breaking his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin is very cute.
You're such a dick.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was fine here.
They look stunned.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never leave the house for socks.
I think Tom is a clapper.
Pain from a terrible infection and her ovaries leaking.
I don't need advice.
This is not worth it.
It's not an option.
Tom is heading for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's been acting weird.
We would have hung them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list from her.
That was very stupid.
How did it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're a force to be reckoned with.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cabbage cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is so relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the point.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
That's it.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom will want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We got everything.
How much for a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, alive?
This was on top of the cup.
I'm done with this.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He is an atheist.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we took a dump.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's warm enough for a decembrist?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm all wet and shit.
Do you stare at him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling you.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people does he have in this room?
I've thought about it.
I'd do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've got your ass sewn up.
You still there?
You're a good one.
I was a little bit of a dick.
