Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but it provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called a rachis, but do show other features of feathers  beards and bearded feathers  researchers have inferred that rachis was probably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or display. The researchers suggested that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not the plumage of a chick.
Scientists say that while the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals plumage belonging to an adult, not a juvenile, individual.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
As far as magnetic inversions are concerned, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was thought to be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations in a rather strict way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to assist at every step of the process, and in the evenings, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said:  We arrested five people for raping the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop. 
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused persons had their faces covered when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted for the murder of her son by the Sheriff Court of Edinburgh.
She is in police custody awaiting her arraignment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish law works differently and the courts have found that the publication of photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that "journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is handling the prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics included the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a period of five years only.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was controlled and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first shooting campaign were properly trained and instructed on safety guidelines.
Martelly inaugurated a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) yesterday with nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth ECP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous PCE as part of a package of measures to set the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been made aware of 27 accidents involving these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry reacted by calling it "very unfortunate" that Apple postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 am local time (21:00 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released prematurely, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a physician.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or  black boxes) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated:  Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman. 
Dustin  Goldust  Runnels commented that  Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even more so... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's in a better place. 
A poll of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of those polled think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her complaints, her fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome his pain, as these are prohibited within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supply for Earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political chatter and nonsense".
He's thought to be running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, rather than the ground-based radar systems used previously, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more detailed information.
There is no additional transport and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and there are no car parks and relay parks on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation has created the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the teams' fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migratory cone-beaked finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be drawn from fine wire, which can be twisted and braided, and it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called  illuminated manuscripts .
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in the pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call a person who is thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite picks up the call in space and then sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below are the larger cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelope and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much larger numbers of smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special task given to each cat, preventing it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herds are made up of one to three related adult males, as well as about thirty females and young lions.
The women are usually very close to each other, their family being composed of a large number of sisters and daughters.
The lion troops act like pack wolves or dogs, animals remarkably similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (although sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is a member of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but rather like a phrase whose words would be shouts and roars.
Ocelots are fond of small animals, and they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by sniffing, sniffing their way across the ground.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they also move very stealthily. Ocelots track their prey by blending into their environment before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it was in before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor compared to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process  speciation , which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce food from the sun by photosynthesis and provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the super predator of the time, it feared nothing but the other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an extra set of teeth in the palate, so that anything that crossed its path could not escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate food that we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive foods, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to host banquets together where they rested on their sides while they ate.
Ancient Roman meals could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a principal temple that was considered the dwelling place of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, to which only the priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were just open counters facing the street.
Since there were no large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was very expensive.
In the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder when he found Greenland and named it so when travelling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is  Scandinavian , there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words  Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776  are found on the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence the large parchment (about 29 by 24 inches) was stored in a roll.
So it's likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion known as Operation  Dragoon .
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term  civilisation  is derived from the Latin word  civilis , meaning civil and is related to the Latin words  civis , meaning citizen, and  civitas , meaning large city or city-state and also indicating, in some way, the size of the society to which it refers.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government  with Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it left it to the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or from those on customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an  archipelago .
The earliest record of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European navigators passing through Taiwan referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been reconstructed to offer tourists a better glimpse of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for photography in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the digital camera's image sensor format.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest of the whole number ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple directive that encourages dynamism and protects the image.
It indicates that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was being challenged.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the European states together despite their differences in language and customs.
Its pervasive power affected everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money has led many people to question whether this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
As this tactic elicited only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from recurring in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous employment) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a volatile age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era which ran for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce struggles were fought between many members of the nobility who contended for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
So after the Revolution, the trades were opened to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranking of the armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond the confines of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as  Hira' on the mountain of  Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived to this day, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
Above, you can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or  Necropolis of Giza , in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol  push  looks like a V and the symbol  pull  looks like a knob or square with the bottom side missing.
The top means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start at the top (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An upward bow usually produces a softer sound, while a downward bow is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own markings in pencil, but remember that the markings of the archers are for musical purposes and should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of shopkeepers.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and the queen.
The king and queen were forced, by the crowd, to have the windows of their carriages opened.
At one point, a member of the crowd brandished the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expense and interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the superprofits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events occurred in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages  the period of history in Europe running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the destiny of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place through a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies that is intrinsically rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass car ownership also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new techniques in the field of health care to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism featured an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to Romantic theories, geography shaped individuals and, over time, geography-related customs and culture emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a centre of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders came back with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 13th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the West.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could be 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great advances of the period, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging to a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some feral children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child was suffering from.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman species, feral children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a learning method but rather a way of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new programme or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a form of support, but the little man in Microsoft Office is also a form of support.
The virtual scaffolds are built into the software and are intended to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the student to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide range of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in a host family is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and rewards.
For example,  learning  and  socialization  are considered to be major factors in promoting Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement  and  ongoing relationships  were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied the public's reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
One claim is that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause the variations between the two basins to alternate with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant resources.
In addition, failure to react has serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termit, eggs) are easily digestible and provide a large amount of protein containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that the chimpanzees of the savanna do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so as to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before bedtime (such as water or tea, which are known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is, and each person has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity, and it is through the visualization of different deities that energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awakened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real-life clashes, through surrogate armies, on battlefields as far afield as Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain as it has done for the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them nearby for easy access to milk, fur, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often tended by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar term for shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
Crossings were introduced early enough to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more effective if they were fitted with an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans started walking standing up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus ( upright man ).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as they usually did.
Bipedal specializations are found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in greater harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and turn it off.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances made by humans, and problems have become more serious because of mankind's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a manuscript draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as  Dunlap Broadsides .
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap leaves that are known to exist are the oldest known copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive.
Not many people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have scaled, clawed feet, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like T-Rexes.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general that immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for the first-aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term  insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects well suited to parasitize humans.
Bedbugs, like bedbugs, are nest-builders, meaning that they are adapted to live in the nest or habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may feel that it is not in their best interests or in the child's to become involved in the education of a newborn.
These couples may choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is the guiding principle of most scientific research.
But it's not the only way, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to cycle for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to either mark the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is an activity that is aimed at people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information on the ecosystem are examples of on-the-spot activities.
For example, you can go and see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns by car to go to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its stable state that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and particular vehicles between two points, and the interactions they exert between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate way.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) throughput, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemers.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought he was right: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 kilometers wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent state and the least populated.
Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
Citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they are found in nature in crude form and are fairly easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything in the universe is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that these would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
Alloys are also found which contain a small amount of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the advent of new writing styles has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to less frequent uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpen.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next new thing comes along.
The fission bomb works by the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of myriads of protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like driving a heavy cart up a hill, by splitting the nucleus again, and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break apart with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of stones and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are about finding what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates people to want the things they do and what in their environment motivates them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the boss of former colleagues: one end of the spectrum being to try to remain  the good buddy  (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things in his/her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The  invisible team is the management team to which each member is accountable. It sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to take on the time-consuming process of creating a learning structure?One of the objectives of putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, of shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
The neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus help to narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain disease and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, injury, tumors and trauma affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technology allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly connoted in science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The aim of research in artificial intelligence is the automation by machines of tasks requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnostics and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been featured in several home computer software and video games.
Excursions are an integral part of any school classroom and oftentimes a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus journey is not possible.
The solution is technology in the form of virtual educational field trips, where students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in a trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and to share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year that is dedicated to their visit to the state's capital, and each year the website is updated, but the old versions are kept online for album use.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often attempt the blogging experience with a poor grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes the situation better.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer began to work on improving her writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging  forces students to know more about the world around them . The need to arouse public interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that fosters collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs 'can enable students to strengthen their analytical and critical skills: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their own views with those of others and express their own views on specific topics' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a wealth of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka region and its surroundings of pristine natural beauty.
All these and many other measures make Ontario what foreigners consider to be the quintessential Canada.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a population comparison that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the mainland and this religion has been widely spread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape route linking Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should state that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advised to wear a ring (which should not seem too precious.
Women need to realise that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours which they consider to be harassment, as it is common for women to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca after destroying it, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, one can easily find places where to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, maroquinery, narguilés and trinkets of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be researched to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for hiking trails for mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility,  Tombouctou  has become a metaphor for distant and exotic lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on Henry Louis Gates's PBS show  Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, with its style being more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each one containing a specific fauna.
It is one of the best known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It may be beneficial to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to certain South African parks, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings that mark the skyline of Hong Kong has been likened to a sparkling bar chart, which is revealed by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the north shore landfills.
So this seems to me to be a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest belt of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however, but also some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marsh areas.
The Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find about 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 in the morning.
Inter-district buses are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese cabot boats.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge overlooking the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres; it is 378 metres long and has two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group inhabiting what is now western Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes inhabiting the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, relied primarily on fishing, hunting, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo courts.
In addition, tournaments and smaller matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Malvinas is the Malvinas Pound (FKP) which is equivalent to one pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the neighbouring islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Malvines money outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely dropping below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer says.
There are no seasons  rainy  and  dry : rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are used to seeing humans, these are still wild animals; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, the bison, the elk, the lynx, the bear, and almost all the other large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, be aware that the odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong odor and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is centered on two harbors, and the most popular are found in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour District) beaches are found on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is the  Number One , a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing.
There are many French wines to taste, but perhaps New Zealand and Australian wines will travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a  café crème  is foreign. A short black is a  espresso , the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April in the northern part of 1770, box jellyfish are found near beaches and estuaries, and they can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveller peace of mind in knowing that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents needed for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be a part of the musical event, you'll have to get there early to find a well-placed campground.
Please note that while the musical performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue late into the night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as the ice crossing can cause unbearable noise in the most exposed cabins.
The cruises to St Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos generally make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers, and rarely have windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests happy and to keep them there.
Some sites offer free drinks, but drunkenness affects judgment, and every serious gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to block you.
Other limitations of visibility may be snowfall or powdery dust or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
The safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable moment for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term  safari  refers to an excursion to the African land, and especially to the savannah, with the purpose of witnessing the breathtaking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and can be observed with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, walking safari or walking safari) is a form of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021 with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the Games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be faced with a tricky situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have a iron and ironing board that can be borrowed, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not want to wear socks that have been ironed, you can try using a hair dryer, if one is available.
Avoid overheating the cloth (this may cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests unknown to them in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered to be parasites.
In some localities duty-free shops provide an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most difficult to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind - steep slopes, narrow roads and tight curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict adherence is even more important than before.
On the other hand, the mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastry is a common feature of the region. Apples are baked and baked all year long, while cherries and plums are popular in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berliner, also called Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, and is accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be  solid  or  liquid , depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia is made up of 17,000 islands, and Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further qualification, the term tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem, as the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.To minimise this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.

Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing.
It is similar to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practiced on rough terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions you can cover a little more distance than on foot, but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on rough tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so in normal circumstances, travelling through several countries requires multiple visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this respect.

Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 16,050 feet [4,892 m].

On some routes, the big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for the small companies, there was a problem.
If they had sent cargo by air, on some routes, it would have taken days to clear and clear customs.
