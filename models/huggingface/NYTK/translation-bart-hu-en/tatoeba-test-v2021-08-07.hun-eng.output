I talked to Tom a few times .
It 's up to you .
It came out of nowhere .
It 's better with your sister .
It comes with the love I feel for you .
It cost a lot more than I expected .
This is a two - euro price .
There could be a problem .
It 's expensive .
It would be a shame to see all that work go to waste .
He definitely freaked me out .
It 's not broken .
I was n't sick .
That did n't help much .
It did n't stop snowing .
It did n't stop snowing .
I 'm not gon na let you come .
Do n't mention it .
No matter who started it and why .
It does n't seem that complicated anymore .
That does n't seem right .
I teach Chinese .
It 's like they poured it on me .
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him .
It was snowing the other day .
Thank you for coming .
Thank you for your trust in me .
It happened early last week .
This happened on our wedding day , honey .
There must have been a reason for that .
It was sudden .
This happened when he was out .
It happened to me several times .
Sometimes it happens .
It happens to everyone .
It does n't taste good .
He has his own value .
It 's been raining since Tuesday .
I think all fat people should be on a diet .
I think everyone 's hungry .
I do n't think he can help you .
I think he 's gon na be fine with his neighbors .
I find your novel boring .
I think some of the film cubes are out .
I think I can do it .
I do n't think I could kill .
I do n't think I could kill .
I do n't think I understand you .
I feel better .
I think I have the answer .
I think I 'll buy it for Tom .
I think I 'm dying .
I think I 'm losing my mind .
I think I 'm ready to change .
I think I need more time .
I thought I saw a rat .
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here .
I think it 's better that way .
I think it 's fair .
It 's very unlikely , in my opinion , that you can do that on your own .
I think he 's leaving .
I think it 's time for a career change .
I feel like it 's time for a break .
I think it 's unfair .
I think it is .
I think Tom was the one who helped Mary .
I think you should leave now .
I think my idea is better .
I think my neighbor might have died .
I think he 's gon na be fine with his neighbors .
I think there 's someone at the door .
I think something 's wrong .
I find spiders cute .
I think he 's at home right now .
I think my idea is better .
I think he 's coming .
I think Tom said something else .
I think we should forget about that .
I think that would explain everything .
I 'm thinking , so I 'm drinking .
I 'm thinking , so I exist .
I do n't think there 's any point in trying to convince him .
I think you did a great job .
I guess that 's exactly what Tom wants .
I do n't think that 's gon na be enough .
I think this medicine will do you good .
I think time will solve this problem .
I think Tom 's been there before .
I think Tom is arousing .
I think Tom 's still unemployed .
I think Tom must be hungry .
I think Tom might be older than me .
I think Tom needs more .
I think Tom wants to do it tomorrow .
I think Tom will be able to help .
I think Tom wins .
I think we can handle it .
I think we should be patient .
I think we 're in the wrong direction .
I think we should be careful .
I think we 're safe now .
I guess you 're all just chatting .
I think you 've dialed the wrong number .
I think you know him .
I think you know the rules .
I think you know what Tom 's girlfriend 's name is .
I think you 're gon na approve .
I think you look great .
I suppose you 'd like it .
I think you misunderstood .
I think you should go in person .
I think you 're the most beautiful girl I 've ever seen .
I think you 're the only one who needs help .
I think you 're doing a really good job .
I think you smell nice .
I feel like you were n't convincing enough .
I think you were right .
I meant Tom .
I thought if we went out to eat , it would cheer you up .
I thought I could trust you .
I thought I was going with him .
I thought I knew him .
I thought it might be worth something .
I thought it was clear what I wanted .
I thought my head was exploding .
I 've thought about my future .
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat , but it was n't .
I thought Tom was still living in Boston .
I thought you trusted me .
I thought Tom was coming .
I thought Tom was still at home .
I thought you were her .
I threatened to kill the neighbor .
That hurts !
It hurts . Stop it !
I 'm under the influence .
It was a big influence on me .
This is an accidental hazard !
It 's a historical play .
It 's hard to put into practice what we talked about .
It 's hard to please everyone .
It 's hard to please everyone .
I have doubts about whether it will work .
It 's getting really late .
He 's gone .
We 're half an hour after midnight .
Some people are hard to understand .
It 's about time you started a new business .
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way .
It 's basically your fault .
He 's in the kitchen .
Wonderful !
It 's noon .
This is my bedroom .
We must prepare for the future .
You need a good rest .
It 's never too late to learn .
It 's good to see you again .
It 's not easy to solve the problem .
The smoke alarm ca n't be turned off .
This is not the best way .
This is not the right solution .
It 's not too much to say that he 's a genius .
It 's not a secret .
I 'm not the one Tom has a problem with .
It 's not that expensive .
This is n't the 19th century .
It 's not the 19th century .
It 's not working .
He could be lying .
It 's not polite to talk with your mouth full .
It 's snowing .
He 's still moving .
Wow , the weather is really bad today !
It 's so expensive !
Thirty meters long .
Time to go to bed .
It 's too easy for him .
It 's up to you .
It 's a useful piece of information .
It 's hot at night .
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby 's diaper .
It just did n't work .
It 's gon na be dangerous .
It 'll be dark when we get home .
It 'll be ready when it 's ready .
It 'll be ready when it 's done .
It 's gon na take a while to get used to wearing glasses .
He 's gon na be gone soon .
It 'll work if I change the polarities .
Consequently , it looks bigger .
Looks good .
It seems I 'm not needed here .
You need a shave .
You do n't seem to be feeling very well here .
It seems like you 've thought of everything .
That makes me sad .
That 's what matters .
This could be a long time .
It could be a trap .
This could save your life .
Maybe we 'd enjoy it if we tried .
I may be late .
You have to wash it .
It has to mean something .
It must have been love .
It must have been stolen .
We need to fix it .
He never existed .
It should never have happened .
I lied to her despite not wanting to .
I told him I would do the best I could .
I told him to come .
I told Tom not to give up .
I told Tom where I bought my bike .
I told you , but you did n't listen .
I told you , I 'm fine .
I told you not to walk .
I told you three weeks ago .
I told you you 'd like Tom .
I have a question for you , too .
I took a long bath .
I was in the tub for a long time .
I 've arranged it .
I was on 58th .
I was sure you were on our side .
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday .
I took off my shoes .
I totally forgot .
It 'll probably be cheaper elsewhere .
It was raining yesterday morning .
It rained yesterday .
It rains a lot .
I work out two hours a day .
I 've traveled all over Russia .
I 've traveled across the United States .
It actually works .
That 's really sad .
I tried everything to keep her alive .
I tried to forget .
I tried to help Tom .
I 'd trust him with my life .
I 'm trying to keep my eyes on things .
I 'm trying to get my mind together .
That 's a nice flag .
Big cat .
It 's a little early for a drink , is n't it ?
That 's a boring word .
It 's a delicate situation .
It 's a dictionary .
Good plan , on paper , anyway .
A gray stone building .
It 's a guard dog .
It 's half an hour before lunch .
It 's a hot day .
It 's a kitchen knife .
It 's dark out there .
It 's all mine .
It 's all right now .
This is nice and good in theory , but will it work in practice?
It 's all your fault .
It 's 7:00 .
It 's already in progress .
It 's 10:00 in the evening .
One of my dreams was always living by a stream .
It 's always the same song .
Environmental disaster .
It 's a nasty business , Watson , a nasty , dangerous business , and the more I see it , the less I like it .
What a shame !
Too bad I 'm late .
Too bad Tom 's leaving .
It 's a big , big , furry pole .
It 's a rumor .
It 's cold .
It 's as art as science .
It 's all in the past .
She 's in school .
It is a very dangerous sport , where a small mistake can lead to serious injury .
It 's a very old book .
Waste of money .
Strange question .
That 's terrible .
It 's been a crazy week .
It 's been a long day .
It was an amazing trip .
This day is exhausting .
Tough day today .
It 's happened before .
It was n't just a week .
It 's been two years since she left me .
That 's better .
Better watering the garden at night .
It 's hot .
It burns .
It 's cheaper to take a bus .
It 's Chinese to me .
It 's closed on Sundays .
It 's closed on Sundays .
It 's closed on Sunday .
It 's closed on Sunday .
It 's cold in here .
It 's cold . I 'm goose bumps .
It 's cold outside .
Why do n't you get a sweater on yourself ?
It 's common knowledge that bears love honey .
It does n't matter whether Tom did it or not .
It 's perfectly normal .
It 's okay now .
It 's dangerous here .
It 's deep here .
This is delicious !
It 's done !
It 's easier to start than to stop .
It 's easy to be brave from a distance .
It 's easy to understand why Tom does n't love Mary .
It seemed like forever to me .
It seemed the bus was late .
That sounds ridiculous .
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together .
It seems nothing has changed .
It looks really weird .
It seems so .
He seems to be lying .
Looks like Tom 's in no hurry .
Like you do n't want this to work out for me .
You seem to me like you 're honest .
You seem wrong to me .
It seems we 're going to have an extraordinary guest .
It 's embarrassing to be late for a date .
That 's exactly what they want .
Expensive .
It 's fair to get paid the same for the same job .
Not nearly perfect .
It 's far from ideal .
This is for you .
You know , it 's funny .
He 's getting upset .
It 's getting serious .
We 're gon na have a rough winter .
It 's not gon na be easy .
It 's lucky to see a shooting star .
It 's good to be gay .
It 's good for learning .
It 's great that you could come !
You 're gon na laugh .
It 's hard not to come to that conclusion .
It 's hard to believe that all this time was clear and sunny .
It 's hard to describe .
It 's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on .
It 's hard to put into words .
It 's hard to say .
It 's hard to steal a thief .
It 's spooky pretty .
He 's got a big head .
Tall .
The kids should be in bed by now .
Stop throwing money !
It 's warmer than usual tonight .
It 's illegal .
It 's important .
It is important that parents are on the same page when it comes to raising children .
It 's important to help the people in trouble .
That 's impossible for me .
You have to drown in here .
You ca n't breathe in here .
It 's impossible to meet your expectations .
It is impossible to fulfill your conditions .
We do n't know what tomorrow brings .
Unbelievable , you know ?
It 's inevitable .
That 's inspiring .
Just a hunch .
Just a little bit further .
It 's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again .
It 's just a phone .
I just do n't want to die today .
It 's kind of hard .
That 's pretty important .
It 's really nice of you to take me home .
It 's nice of you to say that .
It 's late .
Today is laundry .
It 's like a field in the field of the field , and turtles , they found and sharks above it , like flying creatures .
It 's locked .
It 's me again .
It 's me again , Tom .
It 's me !
That 's me .
Pathetic how he lives .
It 's too cold to swim .
This is my horse .
This is my life !
This is my life !
That 's my problem .
This is my suitcase .
Now it 's my turn .
It 's never too late to be what you were .
None of your business .
Not a bad idea .
This is n't a bank .
Not as grumpy as it sounds .
It 's not complicated at all .
That 's not enough .
This is not going to happen .
You do n't have to change Egypt .
This is n't mine .
It 's not my fault .
It 's not negotiable .
It 's not that far .
It 's not that simple .
This is n't the 19th century .
It 's not the 19th century .
It 's not what it looks like .
It 's not what you do , it 's how you do it .
It 's not worth crying about .
I was n't talking to you .
I was n't talking to you .
I did n't tell you .
There 's no point in confessing to the priest if you do n't show remorse .
There 's no point in bitching about the past .
It 's snowing .
It 's obviously broken .
It 's definitely impossible .
Obviously weird .
Obviously , it 's very painful .
It 's okay if some people think I 'm a farmer .
It 's okay to be gay .
“ It ’s been three months , and Tom already says he speaks French fluently . ” — Yeah , it ’s at the top of the stupid one . — What peak?— Dunning - Kruger effect .
It 's only three days .
It 's on the other side of the park .
Sounds good !
It 's over , is n't it ?
It 's over .
It 's personal .
It 's pouring like a vat .
He opened his wings .
It 's quite amazing .
Quite convincing .
It 's pretty simple .
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these mythical theories is manifested in the disgrace of the working class , exempting imperalism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it has caused , and in the idea of the core of the idea that the innate aggressive tendencies of infinite wars are the causes of man 's innate .
It 's urgent .
It 's raining in my heart .
There are few large gardens in Japan .
It 's real , is n't it ?
It 's a big deal .
He 's over there .
It 's rude to ask someone how much they make .
They say Czech girls are beautiful .
They say they 'll be leaving Tokyo soon .
Shit !
It 's just disgusting .
It 's snowing here .
It 's snowing in Boston now .
It 's so nice to stay home !
He 's still moving .
It 's suicide .
Technically , it 's possible .
This is the best book I 've ever read .
It 's the least I can do .
It 's theoretically possible .
It 's the same for everyone .
Same old problem .
That 's something you have to answer .
It 's time to pick up our tent tree .
It 's time to get out of here .
It 's time to go .
Time !
Time to fix the problem .
I should get my hair cut .
Time to rest .
It 's time to tell the whole truth .
It 's about time we did something about this .
Tom 's birthday is today .
It 's Tom 's decision .
Tom 's word is against Mary 's word .
It 's too dark to play ball .
It 's expensive to me .
It 's too hot for that now .
Too late .
It 's too late to worry about that .
It 's typical autumn weather .
Cold is a shitty thing .
It 's ugly , it 's a shocking yellow and it does n't harmonize with anything , but at least they do n't run off in the dark !
It 's under the table .
Maybe he 's not as stupid as you think he is .
It 's unlikely that anything serious will happen .
It 's up to them now .
It 's up to you whether we go there or not .
Very attractive .
It 's very boring .
It 's very cold in this room , is n't it ?
It 's very disturbing .
Very entertaining .
It costs a lot to live here .
That 's very kind of you .
It 's very white .
It 's hot .
That 's what we agreed .
It 's your only option .
A language requires about 10 thousand hours of learning to learn .
You have to be bold to succeed .
It took me almost three years to build my house .
It took me almost three years to build my house .
Everyone was unexpected .
It took me exactly an hour .
It took me a long time to write this book .
It took me over a month to heal from the cold .
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes .
It took a long time , but eventually , we managed to find it .
I turned into a small alley .
I 've been flipping .
I 'm turning left .
It was a beautiful summer day .
It was a difficult time .
It was a friendly competition .
It was wrong to do that .
It was fun .
It was pitch black night .
It was a challenge .
That was a silly question .
It was a stupid idea .
That was a tragic accident .
It was a really good meal .
It was a waste of time for all of us .
It was awfully weird .
It was a wonderful day .
It was a wonderful evening .
It was chaotic .
It was definitely very enjoyable .
We had a good time yesterday .
It was hard at first .
It was hopeless .
It was hot and wet .
It was hot , and the weather was humid .
It was just a trip .
It was just too easy .
I told you .
I wanted this .
It was almost pitch black .
This was soon before John had an idea . John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations .
It was n't a very interesting novel .
It was n't easy for me .
It was n't easy keeping my promise .
That was a low blow .
It was n't interesting .
I was n't the one who slammed the door .
It was n't my fault .
It was n't intentional .
It was n't our fault .
It was n't so bad .
It was n't the first time they did this .
It was n't Tom .
It was a joke .
I only found out his true intentions when I met him .
It did n't hurt .
It rained last night .

It does n't take much time .
It worked beautifully .
It works perfectly with your iPhone .
It 's dangerous .
That would be different .
I 'd have a hard time getting out of here .
It would be pointless .
That would have been better if it had been arranged .
That would n't be brave , that would be silly !
It would have been better if we had n't done that .
I underestimated Tom .

I was here , but you were n't .
I was here at 10:00 sharp , but you were n't .

I sat in a chair in Bern at the patent office , when I had a sudden idea : if a man falls freely , he does not feel his own weight . This shook me up .
I sat next to Tom .
I could n't speak .
I stood by him .
I was home then .
I was in traffic for 30 minutes this afternoon .
I was surprised by what I learned .

I woke up .
I woke up tired .
I was wondering what Tom wanted .
I was wondering if anyone else was wondering as much as I was .
I 'm thinking about how I can do it even better .
I wonder how much that costs .
I wonder how this works .
Time will clear tomorrow ?

Is there a man named Tom here ?
I wonder if Tom will be here tomorrow .
I wonder what happened to Paul .
What did the painter want to express ?
