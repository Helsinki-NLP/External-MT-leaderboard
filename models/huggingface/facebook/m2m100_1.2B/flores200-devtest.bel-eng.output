About the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galápagos is written in a study, which was published in the journal “Novuka” on Thursday.
According to a report by researchers from the University of Princeton (USA) and the University of Uppsala (Sweden), the evolution of a new species took place in just two generations, although earlier it was assumed that this process takes a lot more time. The emergence of a new species became possible thanks to the intersection of an endemic terrestrial york (Geospiza fortes) with an untouched cactus terrestrial york (Geospiza conirostris).

Below are cats of medium size. Their harvest is also of medium size — they hunt both cowboys and antibodies with deer.
In addition to all this, a lot of small cats (including domestic animals on a free hike) catch and eat a lot of small prey — insects, rodents, squirrels and birds.
The secret of their success lies in the fact that each occupies its own niche, i.e. has only its function, and therefore does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are some of the most sociable cats: they live in large herds known as prades.
Pride can include in its composition up to three adult males, who are relatives, as well as three thousand females and twelve.
In most cases females are close relatives, forming large families with sisters and daughters.

The tiger’s whisper reminds of a faster whisper, which consists of sharp and loud words, than the equally loud lion’s whisper.
Acelots are used as food for small animals. When there is such an opportunity, they catch ants, rodents, snakes and birds. Nearly all the animals on which he catches are significantly smaller than acelot.
As scientists assume, acellots pursue and find harvest by smell, smelling traces on the ground.
Thanks to night vision, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. They burn acellots, combining with the surrounding environment and from hiding attacks their harvest.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) departs from the primary population from which they originate (i.e., when moving through a river or mountain, or when such living beings migrate to a new island, so that it will be quite difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from where they came from.
In this new environment different resources and competitors, so to become the strongest competitor, the new population will need different features or adjustments compared to those that it had before.
The original population has not changed at all: like before, the city is still unadapted.
Over time, as a new popule begins to adapt to a new environment, the animal all reminds of the main popule, which has departed.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass and sooner or later these two populations will look to such a degree that no one will think of bringing them to the same kind.
This process we call discovery, which actually means the emergence of new species. Discovery is an inevitable outcome and a very important stage of evolution.

If you watched the film "Treasure of the Nation", then you can think that on the opposite side of the Declaration of Independence was a map of treasures.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is really written on the opposite side of the document, this is not a map of treasures.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, were written: "The original version of the Declaration of Independence from 4 July 1776".
Who wrote it, nobody knows exactly, but it is known that a large pergament document (29 3/4 inches to 24 1/2 inches) at the beginning of its existence was folded to preserve.

Thanks to the landings in Normandy and the next battles managed to liberate the north of France, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was under the rule of the “vishists”. It was those Frenchmen who in 1940 entered into peace with the Germans and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragon began — the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the forces of "Free France" in only two weeks liberated southern territories of France, then headed to the side of Germany.
Civilization is the only culture of a large group of people who work and live together in society.
The aforementioned term “civilization” comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., “citizen”. The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin nickname civis, on the other hand, “citizen”, as well as to the nickname civitas, or “city” or “city-state”. All this, in turn, so or otherwise says something about the size of society.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge through generations, equal distribution and a sustainable cultural footprint.
A few small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full meaning of the word, because they disappear, not leaving after themselves significant historical testimonies.
During the War of Independence thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the House on the formation of a confederation of thirteen states. The composition of this government included only Congress.
On the introduction of taxes Congress did not have powers, and, since the national executive and judicial power did not exist, he expected to ensure the enforcement of all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not set to interact.
At the same time, Mr. A. Toh, in his absence of powers, has introduced state-owned tax laws and tariffs.
According to the House on the formation of the confederation for the introduction of changes needed a unanimous agreement of all the states, and the states were so unconscious of the central government that their representatives were often absent.

The history of Taiwan began back in the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European marques passing through the mima, as "Formosa" — this meant "beautiful islands".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern territory of Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive breeding practice. For the processing of rice and sugar plantations, the company employed few Chinese workers.
The dynasty of Qin (1644-1912) in 1683 captured western and northern Taiwanese territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qin Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Simanasex Treaty, according to which Japan was transferred the right of sovereignty over the island, and the last economy was in Taiwan until 1945.

Thus, the world’s most popular photo format for immovable frames is the 35mm format. At the height of the analogue photography era, this film format prevailed.
Such a film is produced and now, however, the more important, the ratio of its width and height is now used in digital camera matrix formats.
This can be slightly shattered from the pants, but in fact the 35mm format has 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
Accordingly, it is believed that the side ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Such same or similar side relationships have many common formats (for example, the APS format family).
The Trident rule, which is often subjected to attacks and laughter, presents simple commands that provide dynamism and at the same time maintain a certain degree of order in the image.

In ancient China there were unique ways to identify different epochs. At each stage of China's history or in each family under rule there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, periods of dynasty rule were divided by periods of disunited provinces when instability reigned. The most famous of them was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jing dynasties.

Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the boundaries of worldly life. In order to engage in meditation and weighting, he frequently visited the cave on Mount Nur (translated as "light"), known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has endured the trial of times, gives a very bright picture of the spiritual establishment of Muhammad.
The north is isolated from the rest of the world — it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if anyone knows about its existence. Inside the cave you are in complete isolation.
With the clean beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains you will see nothing. From the cave very little of this world can be seen and heard.

The two common ideas are characteristic for most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technologies itself in a considerable degree goes beyond the boundaries of cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, make their own only (and not socially implicit) influence on society.
At the same time, there is a fact that there is a reason for the use of antioxidants to reduce the time of the day.
Nevertheless, if the number of cars will be small, the general national network of motorways has no economic sense. For this reason, the development of new methods of production is underway that will allow to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
Because of the large number of motorists, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new techniques in the field of health care, which allow to treat various injuries.
The great element of cultural determinism, influenced by works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of romanticism.
When we talk about the Romantic era, people were heavily influenced by the geography of the presence. Over time, traditions and cultures associated with it emerged. They were better than lawfully enacted laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and position occupied by society.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the European capital of fashion in feudal times.
Approximately in 400 AD the city becomes known as the epicenter of luxury and retains this status almost until 1100 AD.
Thro the XII century its status as the capital of luxury furniture. This occurred mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, among which were sharp spices and silk, and they were valued significantly higher than offered on the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople entered the title of the capital of fashion Paris.
The flowering of the Gothic style came in the period between 10 and 11, and also in the 14th century.
At first a strong influence on the style of clothing showed the eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles can be delayed by 25-30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people, as a result of the crusades, began to use hats to squeeze clothes, became one of the greatest events of that time.
In natural rural farming is produced such a color of food products that provides exclusive needs of the landlord and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of seeds preserved proper to a certain ecological region in combination with sewage or other not-complicated methods. The goal of all this is to maximum yield.
Many farmers have historically grown natural farming. Now many countries of the third world are still practicing this.
Subcultures bring together human beings with similar views, who from the position of social norms feel themselves divided in mind, and allow them to develop in themselves a sense of self-existence.
Age, ethnicity, class, location and (or) gender of representatives may be distinctive traits of subcultures.
The definition of individual subculture can take place on the basis of various factors — linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style in clothing, manners of behavior and jargon.
As an illustration of that which is a socialization of itself and as much as it is important, most often lead an example with a child who has not had the chance to grow in an atmosphere of gardens, occupation, different nights of noises and abrasions and whom adults did not socialize in childhood.
Such children are called "dick". Some "dick" children have been in captivity for a long time (usually they were treated by their own parents); in some cases, the absence of parental concern was the result of the parents' reluctance to observe serious physical or intellectual violations and disabilities in the child.
To that end, as they were leaving these escaped, the dwarf dwarfs suffered seriously by the dwarf of the dwarf.
Others, for instance, raised animals; according to rumors, some lived independently in wild nature.
If a child is fully brought up by animals, his behavior almost in all (including physical restrictions) reflects the behavior of an animal-educator: for example, such a child can be afraid of humans or be anybody to them.
While the goal of project learning is to make the academic process easier and more interesting, scavenging in this regard goes even further.
Scopoldding is not a learning method, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experiences in learning. This could mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants are both a teacher and a small vaccine in the Microsoft Office program.
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed to ask questions, make suggestions and explain procedures with which the student or listener is difficult to understand independently.
There are many reasons why children can find themselves in foster families. This can be both harsh treatment, and invisibility, and even compulsion.
It is not possible to allow children to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, does not raise them or engage in their education, but this is all happening.
In our view, the system of receptive families is for such girls a safe zone.
It is thought that thanks to our system of welcoming families careful will have reliable medical services, safe ladies, good and caring educators and stable education.
It is believed that a pleasant family must provide all the needs of the twelve who did not enjoy in the house where he was taken.
The Internet is a means not only of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communications.
Thanks to the special features of the Internet are additional possibilities for its use and satisfaction of the needs of the audience.
So, for example, the opinion is expressed that such concepts as “education” and “socialization” are important motives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of “personal participation” and “stable relationships” have also been identified by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience reactions to internet sites.

Claiming, in particular, that the correct interpretation of microscopic words can help determine, deceive a person or say the truth.
In his work “President’s Speech” Oliver Sacks pointed out what image people with a brain impairment, not understanding the speech itself, can, nevertheless, accurately assess honesty.
He even speculates that animals — for example, domestic dogs — can also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
The results of research of the twentieth century testify to the fact that there are two foundations of genetic degeneration, namely, obvious and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutations emerge new genetic variants, and with the help of selection they are removed from the pool of identified.
With each subsequent generation, the segregation and recombination mix the variants in these two pool.
In savannah available plant resources cannot satisfy the need for primates in amino acids, when their digestive system is similar to human.
Moreover, if they don’t, then the consequences are serious. This is both malnutrition, and depression of growth, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins, which can be found in buds and leaves. However, if they are not properly cooked, then organisms of primates such as us are difficult to assimilate.
On the contrary, food of animal origin (morrow, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of proteins, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily absorbed.
Thinking about it all, it is not surprising when it turns out that our ancestors solved their own “protein problem” almost in the same way as chimpanzees in savannah in our time.
Under sleep interruption refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and recovery after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm that will wake you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you are shifting the clock in a dream, try putting it at the other end of the room. Thus, you will need to get up from the bed to turn it off.
In accordance with other options based on biorhythms, before sleeping it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (in the first place water or tea, the well-known macerator) - this makes a person get up at night to wake up.
The inner peace of a man is opposite to the tension of his body and spirit.
The present life force is the more stable, the lower tension. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
The foundation of Tibetan Buddhism lies in the teaching of the Buddha, which was complemented by the love of the Mahayana and a number of methods of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It unites meditation, Kundalini-yoga and love to all mankind.
Followers of Kundalini yoga claim that in order to awaken the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment), you need to practice certain poses of yoga, mantra and visualization, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a major part of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualization of different gods allows you to clear energy channels, open chakras and enlightened consciousness.
During the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the US began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial and cultural conflicts led to conflicts between countries.
Two years after the end of battle actions began a cold war — the earliest allies turned into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and it was truly fought by armies of friendly countries. Battlefields were located in different regions — from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was defeated by 17 September 1939, with the withdrawal and re-grouping along the Romanian positions remaining the only hope.
Nevertheless, only one night these plans lost meaning, because over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army in the composition of the Belarusian and Ukrainian Frontiers entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga peace treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Carriage of cargo by ship — apparently the most effective way of transportation through the ocean of a large number of people and cargo.
Traditionally, the military-maritime forces were treated so that their country was able to transport the people and the goods, and in the same time the workers could not be able to transport the people and the goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Britain, Americans tried to transport people and materials through the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, using for this, mainly, submarines.
Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain in the same way as it would have conquered the rest of Europe if the allies had failed.
It is similar to the fact that goats were first delivered in the Iranian mountains of Zagros about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to always have milk, hair, meat and leather at hand.
Usually domestic goats grazed in herds that wandered in the hills or other walks. Often they were cared for by bodies — children or teenagers. The latter performed the role of shepherds. So the animal is grazed in our time.
In the 16th century, the road was built in England.
Although crowded roads and represented themselves only parallel wooden boards, they allowed heavy horses to move with greater speed and to pull loads with greater weight than on existing uneven roads.
The rails began to be used to keep rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that traffic on rails would be more effective if they were covered with a iron strip.
This practice became widespread, but due to the presence of iron wooden wheels of cars quickly worn out.
After some time, the wooden circles were replaced by iron. The first fully made metal reiki appeared in 1767.
The first known means of movement was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "man walking"), people began to walk in a vertical position.
Asterisk, their predecessors, usually not straight.
Moving persons of australopithecans have been identified in acromelasts, the age of which is 4.2–3.9 million years, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago the sachelantropus had already walked on two legs.
It can be more consciously attended to the surrounding environment, can be a participant of the ecological movement, can even become an activist, so that in the future mentioned packs do not find themselves very strong.
Sometimes this looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a timely solution, then we have to find and destroy the root of the problem.
It is clear enough that due to the technical and scientific advances of mankind the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and the wasteful way of life of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the Declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4, its handwritten copy, signed by Congress Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson, was delivered to John Dunlop's printing office, which was located several blocks away.
Thro the night, 150 to 200 copies were produced, now known as the “Dunlop’s Archives.”
On July 8, John Nixon first publicly read this document in the Independence Hall.
6 July George Washington received one of the copies that he 9 July read to his troops in New York.
To date, the first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have arrived. The original manuscript has not survived.
Many of the modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has managed to survive and that they even exist until now, only we call them birds.
Because of the feathers and weakness of flying, many people do not think of them as dinosaurs.
But the birds to this time have a lot of agave rice with dinosaurs.
They have caps and shells on their legs, lay eggs, and, like Tyrannosaurus rex, walk on their back legs.
Practically all modern computers perform operations with encoded in the form of double medications.
The composition of double numbers can include only one of two values — 0 or 1, and these numbers are called double numbers, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, irritation is a rather common symptom, making it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
Internal poisoning may first be attested by an open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals.
Instructions by acknowledging Termine's medical aid for this particular poison is unnecessary to look at the label.
In order to identify this group of insecticides, an entomologist uses the "Clock" in the formative sense.
This is because the people are well aware of the fact that the human body has been transformed into a human being, and that the human body has been transformed into a human being.
Both dwarf valves and dwarf valves are nesting parasites, they are accustomed to living in nests or in the house of their master.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) have been registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is the main among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the head and spinal brain, as well as the optic nerve.
According to the results of research, it was established that Jews twice as much as men suffered from the hell.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not correspond to their interests in those interests that they already have.
Such a couple can give their daughter a baby.
During the adoption of the parents of the children refuse the rights of their parents, to grow and educate him might other relatives.
The main goal of science is to illuminate through the scientific method the way the world works. In fact, most scientific research is carried out using this method.
There is, however, not only him. The experiment (this is such a test that is carried out to exclude one or more possible hypotheses through questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Most attention the philosophers and naturalists paid to the classical texts. In the first place the speech goes, including, and about the Bible in Latin.
Generally accepted views at that time were considered the thinking of Aristotle on all scientific questions, including medicine, in the sphere of psychology.
When the number of people who mastered the Greek language decreased, the West was found to be devastated by its scientific and philosophical crowns.
Many biorhythms that can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals are largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, periodic rhythms have been recorded that are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even when the call signals do not come, the mentioned process continues in the form of independent freely running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses that claimed that DNA is a genetic material was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA in the bacteria Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments, during which through radioactive phosphorus marked the DNA of the bacteriophage or through the radioactive sulfur - the protein of the bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells embedded by it are cells of the germ line, the mutations can have very different consequences.
Inherited can only be mutations in germ cells. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who have an interest in visiting different natural zones and territories, because they want to enjoy the general nature and landscape, including enjoying observations of flora and fauna.
As an example of that, than you can do in nature, you can bring fishing, fishing, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystems.
As an example, visiting, studying and photographing the orangutans on the island of Barneo can be taken.
Every morning people drive out of their cars from small provincial towns to work. On the road they are passed by other people who work there, from where they have just left.
In this dynamic transporter turnaround all have this different touch to base on the particular vehicle transport system and support it.
Scientific data testify to the fact that the modern high-carbon economy violated the stability of the biosphere, which in a significant degree contributed to human evolution throughout the last two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who participate in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries you would like to hear such a lot of complaints about falling masters or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly stop working? Is there a cause in insufficiently competent transport engineers? Is there something more significant happening?
The concept of "transport movement" involves analyzing the movement of individual drivers and transport vehicles between two points, as well as studying how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of the transit bikes presents a complex problem, because it is impossible to be sure of the prevailing behavior of the cylinders.
Drivers, on luck, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, as a rule, transport flows are characterized by a certain rationally determined sequence and can be approximately described with the help of mathematical models.
In order to more fully and qualitatively show what constitutes the movement of vehicles, it has been established as linked between three of its main parameters: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps the planner and design of road vehicles, and also works with their operators.
The first of the animals in the air arose insects. The ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more effectively, as well as finding partners and food.
On the other hand, the wings of the wings fell apart from the whole body.
Thanks to this, they can get killed in different small places, to hide there in hell.
Strawberries and flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings.
One man, named Aristarchus, several thousand years ago claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some have argued that he was right, but many have adhered to a different opinion — that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
It’s smart, because it’s a hard-to-do, hard-to-do, because it’s a hard-to-do, it’s a hard-to-do, isn’t it?
The Amazon River ranks second on Earth by length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times more than in the river, which ranks second.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
The Amazon is a source of no less than 20 percent of all water that enters the oceans from the rivers of the planet.
The Amazon River, into which water flows from thousands of smaller rivers, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although the construction of the pyramids with the use of stone continued until the end of the era of the Old Kingdom, in terms of size and technical excellence of the building nobody and never could surpass the pyramid of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the period of the New Kingdom came to captivate their forefathers of monuments, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
The Vatican has only about 800 inhabitants. It is the world’s smallest independent country with the smallest population.
In the laws and official messages of the Vatican is used Italian language.
Most of those working in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (such as gold, silver and copper) are found in nature in a natural form and they are relatively easy to extract with the help of primitive work devices, people knew about them back in antiquity.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed that the composition of any thing includes one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas-like and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can be transformed into other substances to eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or several metals. Keep in mind that the regular table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. In fact, there are also such metals as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, the composition of which includes a small number of non-metallic components. Such non-metallic components can be, for example, carbon.
From mathematics is made everything in the Universe. All matter is made up of small particles — atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that in the point that stands at the end of this word, their place is a trillion.
As a result, when the allure appeared, he became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the significance of the novel and the number of its modifications decreased and the appearance of new metaphors.
People in our time write messages on the screens of computers, and the message is not needed by anyone.
We can only guess what fate will hit the keyboard when it comes to change something newly.
The principle of action of the plutonium bomb consists in using the energy of nuclear synthesis when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It’s like riding up a very heavy wheel. The second division of the core will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they have a tendency to break down with slight external influence or at all without it.
The surface of the Moon is made up of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the curve on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side - about 100 km.
Under the monthly marriages the moon is thinner, and under the height is thicker.
Monthly seas may be more on the nearest side of the month, because here the thinner curve, and accordingly, the lava of pigs was to rise to the surface.
There are many different types of theories that focus on what these humans are doing.
The aforementioned theories originate from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires that they transform inward and which give a subjective character (i.e., internalize) during becoming.
The aforementioned theories describe what exactly causes individual people to desire what they are doing, and what facts in their environment can affect what they will do certain things.
“Theory of Hierarchy of Needs” of Olov and Herzberg’s “Two Factor Theory” are two authoritative theories.
In essence, when leaders lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior can occur. At one end of the spectrum there will be attempts to remain “your boyfriend” (or “your girlfriend”).
A manager who relates to this type can experience difficulties with assessing the effectiveness of work, adopting unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibilities and attracting the culprits to responsibility.
Another extreme is the situation, when a person changes to unrecognition — feels the necessity to change everything that the team had done to the doge, and attribute this to themselves.
In the final outcome, the responsible for the success and failure of the commander is the leader.
This kind of behavior ends with quarrels between leaders and other members of the team.
Standards of excellence for ordinary teams should be followed and virtual teams, but there are small differences.
Usually virtual team members perform for the corresponding real group the role of a contact center.
Considering that such teams can encounter independently of the time zones, they often have a greater freedom than members of traditional teams, which may be incomprehensible for a local governor.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of leaders to which each member is subordinate is the so-called “invisible team”. It defines the standards for each member.
For what reason can an organization want to go through the ongoing process of creating an educational organization? Innovation is one of the ways to apply organizational learning concepts to practice.
Creativity and creativity can appear when in functional departments of the organization all available resources are used effectively.
Thus the process, which is used by an organization, the employees of which are trying to jointly overcome some obstacle, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process, satisfying customer needs.
The leadership of the organization should create a culture that is characterized by awareness, knowledge exchange and organizational training. Only after this can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006) continuous approach represents a method by which organizations can higher efficiency.
The theoretical approach to the study of knowledge is supported by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the area of research is narrowed and made more accurate.
Results of studies that received scientists confirm the presence of a close relationship between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that different types of cerebral trauma, eye damage, formation, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain affect behavior and change some mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and therefore unknown processes in it.
Thanks to this we receive a huge amount of materials and data for the construction of simulated models, which in turn help us understand the processes that take place in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually causes associations with science fiction, in fact, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which studies behavior, learning process and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves attempts to make machines automate tasks, for the performance of which it is necessary that machines behave intelligently.
As an example, you can bring planning and control, the ability to respond to requests and technical problems in customers, as well as recognize faces, voices and whispers.
They came out in individual breathing pills that learn things from a real life and offer a rainbow for them.
At present, AI is frequently used in the economy, medicine, technical and military spheres. In addition, it is a software component for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school teaching. Sometimes a teacher drives students to such meals that it is impossible to get to by bus.
With the help of modern technologies it is possible to organize virtual tours. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or admire the beauty of art. And all this without leaving the class.
Joint participation in virtual excursions also represents a very good way to weigh over trips and share experiences on activities in the future.
Students of Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, about their trip to the capital every year form a website, and every year it is revised, but in the network in the form of an album remains the old version.
Additionally, keeping blogs can improve students’ writing language. Though initially keeping a blog grammatics and spelling in them often “falsifies”, this usually changes to the better due to the availability of audiences.
Considering that students are usually the most intriguing audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve his style.
In addition, keeping a blog “helps students to better understand the world around them.” The need to maintain audience interest inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interesting (Tota, 2004).
Blogging promotes collaboration and encourages students to learn more and more, and offers a traditional school approach.
When students use blogs properly, they will be able to “develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active response to online materials will help students define their own stance on what other people have written, as well as express their own views on individual problems” (Orovets, 2002).
Ottawa is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find many art galleries and museums that give you the opportunity to get to know the country’s past and its present.
The Niagara Falls lies further south, and in the north is Lake Muscoco, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
That’s why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Antarctica a typical Canadian province.
On considerable parts of its territory, which are far north, lives quite a few people, and some and in general represent themselves almost as uninhabited desert.
For comparison, the following fact can be brought as a surprise: the number of Africans in the United States is higher than the total number of Canadians in the United States.
East African islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. If you talk about living nature, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all the islands of smaller size are either independent states, or relate to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and to the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese researcher Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around Cape of Good Hope, the beginning of European influence and policy of colonialism relates.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western border is the Atlantic Ocean.
Jews: Tourist-wives advise the day before they say they get married, even if this is not the case.
Aaron Toh, may be useful to wear a ring (so that Ian didn’t look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences they can encounter behaviors that fall under their characteristics. Local residents can often go tourist, catch hands, and so on.
Resolutely reject men and boldly defend their views (despite cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca in the 10th century BC was founded by Berber fishermen. Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids used this city as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755 they left this place.
The Moroccan Sultan restored the city and named it Daru l-Badjiya. The name Casablanca the city received from the Spanish traders who created a trading base there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Next to the Old City of Medina you can quite quickly find a place where they trade traditional Moroccan products – products with leather, handicrafts, tadzhin, cakes and various cakes, but they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Homa is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near the border with Rwanda, which enjoys popularity among tourists.
In 2002 Goma disappeared from the face of the earth lava from the volcano of Niragonga. It buried under it most of the city streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Homa is sufficiently safe, in order to go beyond its boundaries, it is worth to conduct a small investigation to find out whether it is carried out at a certain moment by warfare activities in the province of Northern Kivu.
In addition, the city plays the role of a base for climbing the volcano of Niragonga. Here are also offered very inexpensive services for amateurs of observing the mountain gorillas — more attractive prices in Africa is difficult to find.
To get around Goma, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative inaccessibility of Tambuktu, its name began to be used as a metaphor to designate distant exotic meats.
Despite the reputation of tourist attractions and the availability of the airport, today Tsimbuktu is the city that governs the gallery.
In 1990, due to a threat from the desert sand, it was included in the list of objects of world heritage that threatened danger.
Henry Louis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city in the program of PBS channel “Wonders of the African Continent”.
In comparison with the rest of the cities of the country, the city is even more outstanding, because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPC) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. In the east it borders with Mozambique, in the north - with Zimbabwe, and through the river Krakow passes its southern border.
The area of the park is 19,500 km2. It has 14 squares, in each of which different animals live and different plants grow.
It presents itself one of the most interesting places of the country, and is also considered the most significant of the National Parks of South Africa.
As in all national parks of the South African Republic, in the park daily take a fee for entry and collect from visitors an ecological collection.
In addition, it may be advantageous to acquire the so-called Wild Card – a subscription that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The name of the country Hong Kong borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is the center of attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, shaping the architectural face of the city, are compared to a shiny column diagram, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be comforted if you leave the island and head to the opposite coastline of Cowloon.
