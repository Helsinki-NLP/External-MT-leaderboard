28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
But the victim's brother says he can't imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting, "At last things were going well for him."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department says the death has been classified as homicide and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that operates as a close-knit family and he will be sorely missed," the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently "things were finally going well for him."
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was always to cook us a dish, to cook us dinner, "Luis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who was swimming with the tide.
"For all the bad things that happen to this world, it was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Churkin said that the UN Security Council meeting on Crimea was useful.
Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said that the recent meeting of the UN Security Council on Crimea was useful, Interfax reports.
"I think the discussion was good for us, and we provided them with information about what happened," Churkin said.
He explained that, at closed consultations of the Security Council, he provided member states with information about incidents on the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read out a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, which "expresses concern and indignation over the attempted terrorist attack and sabotage on the territory of the Republic of Crimea."

Italy's public debt rises to record levels
The size of Italy's national debt exceeded 2.248 trillion euros in June 2016.
The country's central bank said that this amount is a historic high, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
Back then, public debt stood at €2.228 trillion.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy's debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier, it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy's national debt amounted to 132.7% of the country's GDP.
Meanwhile, Italian Minister of Economy and Finance Pier Carlo Padoan predicted a decline in this indicator in 2016 to 130.9%, and in 2018 to 123.4% of GDP.
141 victims of the terrorist attack at Domodedovo received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the Aviation Fund, which was created by the management of Domodedovo airport to help the victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to airport spokesman Alexander Vlasov, two more applications are currently under consideration.
"The Foundation continues to make charitable payments to the victims of the terrorist attack in 2011 and provides comprehensive assistance in resolving existing issues," added Vlasov, recalling that the Foundation's website, which contains full information on the procedure for rendering charitable assistance, was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims.
In 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an explosive device in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo foreign airlines.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 37 people were killed and another 172 were injured.
Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-living vertebrate is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, RT reports.
Scientists conducted radiocarbon analysis of the eye lenses of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, which is more than five metres long, can be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in shark longevity, leading to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks do not reach sexual maturity until they are 150 years old.
Previously, it was thought that the longest-living vertebrate animal was the shark's "neighbor," the bowhead whale.
The oldest specimen known to scientists was just over 210 years old.
Putin has changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a decree amending the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier, it became known that Putin removed the head of the Presidential Administration, Sergei Ivanov, and appointed Anton Vaino as his successor.
Ivanov will now serve as the President's Special Representative for Environmental Protection, Ecology, and Transport.
Deputy Secretary of the Council Rashid Nurgaliyev was excluded from the list of permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Sergei Ivanov, Anton Vaino, Sergei Menaylo, Plenipotentiary of the President in the Siberian Federal District, and Nikolai Tsukanov, Plenipotentiary in the Northwest Federal District, are included in the Council.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of the post of head of the presidential administration.
Sergei Ivanov has been relieved of the post of head of the Kremlin administration by presidential decree.
Ivanov has been appointed Special Representative of the Russian Federation for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport.
Anton Vaino, who previously held the post of Sergei Ivanov's deputy, has been appointed the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer to another job.
Is it worth going to a health resort if there are no health problems?
Our expert is Olga Bogush, Chief Medical Officer of the sanatorium.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should they go to a health resort?
Health resort rest is necessary for us not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a health resort, a person can check the condition of his or her body and receive recommendations from a doctor on how to live, so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal from the body, and should not be dismissed.
Constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of visitors experience stress.
Moreover, people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55 are the most exposed to it.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and let yourself rest in time.
Research shows that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay at a health resort.
Modern health resorts offer a comfortable vacation for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your holidays with your children, you don't have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest ones, there are health programs that include diagnostic services, pediatrician consultations, tests, and therapeutic services.
For example, swimming (many health resorts have children's pools), inhalations, a special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and therapeutic exercise.
The course of procedures is determined by a doctor taking into account individual indications and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, there is, as a rule, a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes and various workshops.
Some health resorts even open their doors to guests with babies, provide the necessary facilities for infants, and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
Mild winters, long summers, and an abundance of sunny days per year (more than 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially as most procedures are conducted indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, it is advisable to conduct spa treatment twice a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region is, of course, the medicinal mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Yessentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different body systems.
Water differs in temperature, salt quantity, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, Narzan has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Yessentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract and lowers sugar levels.
"New Yessentuki" has anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effects.
Slavyanovskaya water has the same effects.
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salty water because salts trap fluid, leading to increased pressure.
Intake of mineral water requires adherence to a regime: the water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now various cosmetic procedures for the face and body are also available in health resorts.
What kinds of health improvement based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at resorts in this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the salt lake Tambukan, mud from which is useful for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, absorbing, immunomodulatory effect.
These are health walks along individually designed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the Narzan mineral spring.
There you can also take baths of wine, pearl, iodine-bromine, selenium, sage-liquorice, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Let's prolong the fruit-bearing period.
What can be done to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
Yuliya Belopukhova, an agronomist and dacha dweller, tells us.
It is time for the tall tomatoes to get a haircut: remove the new stepsons, cut off the top of their heads, remove all the leaves up to the penultimate brush with the fruit and the flowerbeds with small ties - they will not have time to ripen.
We feed all tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution," as well as peppers and eggplant, with ash-superphosphate extract, and treat them with bio-preparations (Dovriatel - to accelerate the filling and growth of the fruit, Fitosporin-M, Fitolavin, Gamair, Baktofit - against diseases, Immunocytofit - to enhance immunity, Bitoxybacillin, Lepidocide, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals, only copper sulphur, colloidal sulphur, and green soap should be used at the end of summer.
We do the last watering of the plants.
In the greenhouse, lower the long-plaited cucumbers so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, water it with warm water and Zircon solution, and cover the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
Extending the fruiting of courgette is also easy: cut off the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night-time cold, place an arc with cover material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close them after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists have seen signs that Russia is emerging from the longest recession in two decades.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% year on year.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest Rosstat data, the Russian economy slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently announced stabilization of the situation.
Slow growth lies ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is behind us, and slow economic growth is ahead," reads the Bank of Russia's bulletin What Trends Say.
The regulator raised its model estimate of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted decline in GDP was 0.2% quarter-on-quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April, it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15, "RIA Novosti quotes a representative of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade as saying.
The slowdown in the rate of decline of the Russian economy over the last five quarters indicates that the "bottom has been crossed."
Among other markers pointing to signs of recovery in the national economy, Bloomberg cites rising demand for electricity and rail transportation, and a revival of business.
Adjusting for the leap year, it is clear that the plus-1% growth in electricity consumption can be attributed by half to extra working hours.
Add to that the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is growth in freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality, "explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
But there are other, more obvious signs that the Russian economy is stabilizing.
For example, reducing price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2%, compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If we look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year in August.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy, "emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, there has been an increase in industrial production in the Russian Federation.
In June, the figure rose by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
Positive dynamics can also be seen in the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was only in September 2015 (5.2%) that it was lower.
Despite the favorable situation in the labor market, the issue of real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In year-on-year terms, the figure is down by 4.8%.
This factor could impede economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, their share in the structure of the economy exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's rigid policy can also be cited as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator is keeping the rate at 10.5%, which is not good for the real sector.
Underinvestment is also a negative factor, constraining the development of industrial capacity.
But on the whole, we can assume that by the end of the year, the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% compared to -3.7% in 2015, "says Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club Group.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well established in winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are competing for Russia in the Rio Olympics, in most cases they are natives of countries - former republics of the Soviet Union.
On the other hand, in Rio de Janeiro we can observe the reverse process: quite a large number of Russians are performing under flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of nationality is different.
Some were taken to another country by their parents as children, leaving no choice.
Someone couldn't stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone thought that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
Kommersant found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The 27-year-old's German passport says her name is Lisa Ryzih.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, when the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There, she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps and take up athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa opted for pole vault.
Had she stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to "dethrone" Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only fellow countrywoman, albeit a former one, in the pole vault.
Her best achievements in the sport were bronze at the 2010 European Championships and silver at the 2016 Continental Championships, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
In large part because of their faith, they left for the US when the girl was just three years old.
In addition to Elena, the family had eight other children.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started getting carried away with wrestling at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where in the Training Center of Wrestling of the USA continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup that year, it was a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the World Championships in 2010.
It was followed by a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronized swimming.
But to say that it was brought up by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon after, the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Maria continued her studies.
Soon after, she was part of the US team and performed admirably at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that, on a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America its performance is a ceiling.
Kristina Shaldybina received a new name, which sounds strange in Russian, at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue the girl's training in rhythmic gymnastics across the ocean.
Until that point, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly became a member of that country's youth team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
Of course, she didn't have to fight for first place on the world stage, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - she led the star-studded team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany, where the girl had better prospects of getting into the national team.
Soon after, she was representing her country at the 2012 Olympics in London.
There, however, Jana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to get into the final competition in the individual championship.
But two years earlier, she still managed to win a bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, only this time sporting, is Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration routes of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, the choice of Irina's family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira still trains in Russia - specially comes home not to lose her skills.
She didn't perform as well in Rio as she would have liked.
The best place is 40 in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a national record in the 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she was granted Swiss citizenship and started performing under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4x100 medley relay.
In order to get to the Games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to raise about 6,000 francs, which enabled her to pay for the preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov practically spent his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time prize-winner of the European championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped being part of our national team, it was time to think about changing nationality.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sporting scene.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
Even less is known about another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, in his homeland than about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to engage in artistic gymnastics.
He has not had much success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in qualifying on the parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympics in artistic gymnastics is a breakthrough.
When Nastya, born in Moscow in 1985, was just 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming lessons, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry had already become national champion.
In the same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kreuter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to the high jump, Dmitry is engaged in the long jump and triple jump.
31-year-old Albert - another native of Khasavyurt who after long performances for Russia made the decision to change the sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Mastery of Krasnoyarsk, even becoming national champion in 2011.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow to a member of the USSR volleyball team, Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally one year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family stayed there permanently.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he won bronze at the European Championships held in his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and found himself with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, his parents decided to emigrate.
The original target was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - we had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to be trained in free-style wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for participation in the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again free-style wrestling, and again the former Russian.
This time it will be about a native of North Ossetia who emigrated to Spain - Taimuraz Friev.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship and now plays for the national team of that country.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to score high results in Russia as well.
He became the bronze medalist at the national championships in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of not getting into the national team, Taimuraz made a decision to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is Arthur Biyarslanov, a Chechen boxer born in 1995 in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family via Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to box.
Since then, Arthur has been Canadian champion three times, and in 2012 became world youth champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.
Head of the Executive Office of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
On Friday, 12 August, Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino as Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration of Russia.

Why do Cossack children need classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "Cossacks need to be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They must grow up and understand from the age of at least 7 that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossack.
But so far, it seems to me that this work is proceeding formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated before, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything is rushed and unfamiliar, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continue to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are encroachments on funds allocated to the public utilities sector from budgets at various levels.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the sphere of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid energy companies by more than 170 million roubles.
Recently, the Prosecutor's Office of Krasnodar Krai also revealed the facts of the inclusion of unjustified costs in tariffs.
And 4 mln. roubles were included in the expenses of OOO IV-Consulting (which supplies cold water) for car rental at a price above the market price.
And there are plenty of such examples across the country.
People pay the last money for "communal services," and they pay properly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection rate from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to investigators, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov signed contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was actually not performed, but paid.
Businessmen simply gave him most of the money back.
And as the owner of the management company, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and residents amounts to millions of roubles.
Makarov's scheme of manipulation is, alas, typical of Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of leaders of the financial management companies, who embezzled citizens "money, has swept across the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kokhan, also a former deputy of the City Council, who is accused of fraud amounting to 91.7 million roubles, continues.
According to investigators, in 2012-2013, in Elizovo, Kamchatka Krai, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contractual work for the management company, while the other two played the role of clearing and cash centers, that is, they accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kokhan did not transfer funds to the power engineers, but spent them on himself, his beloved.
Judging in the sphere of housing and communal services is quite difficult.
Cases are not initiated, they drag on.
And extremely complicated housing legislation "helps" in this, says Svetlana Razvorotneva, Executive Director of the NGO Housing and Utilities Control.
We do not have time to make one law work, but we are coming up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including judges, on housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves admit that very little attention is paid to housing law in higher education.
Refusals to initiate criminal proceedings and red tape during investigations are also reported in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes under investigation in 2015, less than half went to court.
In the rest, the investigation took a long time, and one in five was suspended for failure to identify the accused.
Often, shortcomings in law enforcement agencies are blamed on gaps in existing legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of forgery - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
In the first 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is forgery of the minutes of the residents "meeting?
This means that changes in the management of the house, financial and other issues are bypassing the opinion of the owners.
And it also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, rather than "milking" the population, cannot break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that residents are in a negative position, and small and medium-sized businesses are, too.
First of all, due to the eradication of corruption as such throughout the state, Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is convinced.
And now this work is being actively carried out.
These are not just isolated actions; they are a deliberate course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital does not smell of scandals.
Why are there no such scandals in the sphere of housing and communal services in Moscow as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed an iron will and brought order, Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told AiF.
I have in mind personnel issues, legislative amendments, and legal education.
Managing companies are closely monitored and all have gone through licensing.
Complaints from citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (both residents' appeals and response measures are posted on the Moscow government portal).
Many do not just pay the monthly bills, but carefully follow what is written there, how the house is maintained.
Awareness among the public about the rights of owners and the obligations of resource and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow verifies the reasonableness of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of the budget funds go to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Perhaps all of this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
It turns out that everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Perhaps the unwitting should change jobs?
A Turkish gambit.
Can Erdoğan give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has issued an ultimatum to the US, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, the Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating the coup.
He said this while addressing his supporters in Ankara.
Erdoğan called on Americans to withdraw their support for the "Fethullahist terrorist organization."
This is not the first statement from Turkey calling on the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
"Sooner or later, America will choose between Turkey and FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either FETO, the coup organizer, or democratic Turkey.
It must make this choice, "the Anatolian Agency quotes Erdoğan as saying on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
Turkey's president has once again, but more harshly, demanded that the US comply with his demand, first voiced by him immediately after the insurgency was quelled.
Recall that on the night of 16 July, an attempt was made in Turkey by high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdoğan addressed the population, the rebellion was quelled and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people fell under suspicion, including, in addition to the military, teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdoğan, Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States, acted as their mentor.
Erdoğan's supporters have also suggested that the Americans may also be directly involved in the coup.
The US has denied all the claims against it, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising a change of tone.
The latest statement by representatives of the State Department in this regard was made during Erdoğan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
But this does not stop Turkey's president, who insists on his own and also makes demands of his other Western partners.
"Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens," Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Ömer Çelik stated on 9 August.
According to him, Ankara's introduction of changes to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would jeopardize Europe's own security.
Note that on August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union by promising to open its borders to migrants in order to facilitate the visa regime with the EU.
His words were in response to a corresponding statement by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu.
Çavuşoğlu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, suggesting that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of leaving the alliance if it does not receive the expected support from it.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign countries in the defense sphere - they import missiles, "Çavuşoğlu said in an interview with Anadolu news agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have begun to look for others," the Minister stated.
Experts believe that all this points to serious differences between Turkey and the West and the country's reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot accept a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both in terms of business and military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think that Erdoğan will try to strike a balance by maintaining a framework of relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a fully compliant person in the post, "the expert explained.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about non-payment of compensation to the EU, the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the United States), he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdoğan will face a deterioration of relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country, and so on," Minchenko believes.
Head of the Center for Political Information Alexei Mukhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes convenient for him.
Eight months ago, Erdoğan took an extremely hard line against Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation has reversed itself.
There is no guarantee that Turkey's president will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdoğan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once he finds himself between the two poles - the West and Russia - he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself, "Mukhin said.
According to him, the main task for the president of Turkey today is to retain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin to stop the US from supporting Gülen.
Both the EU and the US need Turkey to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached, "the expert believes.
Anna Glazova, Head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East, holds a different view.
Currently, Turkey's relations with both the EU and the US are quite tense, and this is primarily due to Erdoğan's personal domestic policy.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no accident that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been settled, and active political interaction with Iran is underway, "Glazova explained, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdoğan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then, from a position of" zero problems with neighbors, "that Turkey began to actively develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The President of Turkey has now made very successful visits to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position both in the regional and international arena, "the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is rather whether the EU will start to respond harshly to Turkey, which may decide to open its borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action
Representatives of junior doctors have asked the union to authorise further industrial action in their dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is set to ask its full council to support more industrial action from early September.
JDC says ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to scrap the contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted by secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairman Helen McCourt said the government had continued to "stubbornly remain silent" on the issues she said led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "Given the current circumstances, the JDC chief executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in its entirety and has called for formal renegotiations on all of your issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC leader today made a formal request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a rolling programme of industrial action starting in early September.
The dispute has led junior doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in NHS history.
The BMA's junior doctors "leader, Dr Joan Malawana, resigned after voting to scrap the agreed terms of the contract recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members that the deal was a good one to accept, during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of the Bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I got the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more than anything.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin's smile looked strained, and he hardly radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, by contrast, has spoken repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my view, his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin has shown that the Russian leader has forgotten nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr Putin launched an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse, coming from a supposed friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have been waging a stunning, all-out offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks should be held responsible for everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr Erdoğan's own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied it.
But there was an official signal in St. Petersburg that it was time to move on.
After all, the meeting only happened because Mr Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdoğan.
Russia could claim a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdoğan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from office last month in a coup attempt.
Repeat terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him, too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has plummeted by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies will certainly feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They are betting on an end-of-season peak in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," according to a report in the Vedomosti newspaper.
But the visit also had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to that its long-standing discontent with the tortoise-headed pace of EU accession talks and Mr Putin's move - which seeks to take advantage of the chill and gradually sever Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Mind you, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this glitzy seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West join forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after almost three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even address the topic.
Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering questions about their differences, while Mr Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the possibility of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer credit brands.
It has been backed by millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But it has now been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including its external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be employed in because we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something very different in their respective populations, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup and it is building a profile of different brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is the right time for us to move the bank of brands, because at the core (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the chief executive.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of customers rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to that landmark with his second winner of the night on his home track, Predilection, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach that milestone in smooth racing.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here too
I'm very happy it happened at Newmarket because it was where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big social event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free-spirited and very unpretentious.
Dettori accepts applause as he leads Predilection after victory
Two jockeys have reached that milestone in steeplechasing: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached the mark so few have reached before him.
He is classy and strong, but it is his tactical acumen that sets him apart from others in the weight room.
He is a great ambassador for horse racing and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have led 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big horse!
Seriously, Frankie has been bringing winners to the UK for the best part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying jump
From meteoric finishes to meteoric jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It's had its ups and downs.
Plenty of big-race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and served a doping disqualification.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to defy the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not be finished for a while - Dettori has previously said he would like to continue competing until at least the age of 50.
Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly sacked his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed environment and transport spokesman.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not give a reason.
Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital, Tallinn, in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
Later, he was head of the presidential protocol department and the government apparatus, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think the administration's most important task is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are carried out.
Putin told a Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be removed from the post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Are smiles convincing?
It is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin that was shown on state television, both men said the chief of staff resigned of his own volition.
But despite the smiles on camera, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary election.
So these are the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official announcement - that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this very difficult post, even, one might say, a problematic post, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was chief of staff to the President for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, as is Mr Putin.
In the late 1990 "s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia's president after Putin's second term, because a third term for Putin would be unconstitutional.
But another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev, has taken over.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after just three and a half years.
"Thinking Like a Crime" star Thomas Gibson fired after fight with producer
Gibson was involved in a scuffle on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his firing in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on set and differences of opinion.
I regret that it happened, "he said in a statement.
Details about how Gibson's character will be eliminated from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love 'Think like a criminal' and have put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but now it will not be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, cast, our wonderful team, and, most importantly, the best fans the show could have dreamed of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish land in Banff garden
A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes the 75 fish may have been sandstones left behind by the water storm.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the north span and Queensferry Crossing viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "blade fans," which are now nearing completion near all three of the bridge's pylons.
The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 bridge canopies.
The £1.35bn project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering on a truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge is a masterful operation, using extremely precise tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the total pavement is now in place, and for the last section of the pavement, concrete is being cast in Rosyth today, which means that the entire pavement is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure on every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it to the widening North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern - or shore-facing - side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a massive and at the same time very graceful operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised at a gradient of about 3%.
Elegant because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny - just a few millimetres in each direction.
Fortunately, it all went very well.
Moelfre Bay rescue: Three men 'lucky to be alive'
Three men are 'lucky to be alive' after they were thrown from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 13: 20 BST on Friday after the crew saw the incident unfold in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety as their boat continued to move.
"We saw their boat circling next to them and assumed the worst," Moelfre lifeboat helmsman Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, by the time we got to the water, strong winds had blown it away from them," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while a third man in his 60s was found exhausted and clinging to a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all taken aboard the inshore lifeboat and taken to a rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency breaker, but it had somehow detached itself from the man who was driving the boat when it capsized.
Someone was guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
That teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and into some physical activity.
Screen time was initially limited to TV, then video games and, more recently, smartphones.
It's great to see that technology and outdoor activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am referring, of course, to the ubiquitous craze that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990 "s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other offshoots).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all of this became obsolete a little before this new game became available in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS and, once detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
A generation who played the game when they were younger has joined the craze, jumping off couches to search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "average" person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people it tracked who performed 30 minutes of exercise each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who is playing Pokémon Go, it just sees raw data on levels.
Many health campaigns urging people to "find 30 minutes," "get off the couch," and "be active every day" have fallen on deaf ears, because most health messages are boring and delivered by people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight gain, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are bored bores looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble across the door.
So what?
The breakthrough has come.
After all, while smartphone apps such as Fitbit could previously track our physical activity, they didn't give us a reason to exercise, as this game does.
The novelty will wear off, and usage will wane over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles wins all-around gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the vault.
Relaxed on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
And now, finally, an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of all-around champion on Thursday, putting the chasm between herself and the rest of the world on display in a convincing display under intense Olympic scrutiny.
Her total score of 62.198 was a reasonable distance from silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Biles of the United States performs on a gymnastics beam during the final of the Women's Individual Rhythmic Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She burst into tears when her final total score was revealed and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."
One final test awaits in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field as between her and the weight of high expectations.
Anything less than heading back to his family home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would have been seen as an unfulfilled expectation.
Simone Biles of the United States, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the Women's Individual Rhythmic Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned her first gold on Tuesday, setting a beautiful final chord for retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's farewell party.
While Biles insisted she never looked to the future during her long road to the top, that's not exactly the case.
Part of her freestyle exercise program - the one that includes her trademark pass - is set to Latin American music that would fit right at home on the street just outside Rio's Olympic Arena.
This is no coincidence.
The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Amy Boorman's mother during a visit to the gym where Boorman was a coach has become a force.
She hasn't lost an all-around championship since the summer of 2013 - a streak that should last as long as Biles wants it to.
Although Mustafina gained a slight advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastics and freestyle - where Biles is defending her world title - lie in wait.
She came out on top again with 15.433 on the beam and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white, and blue eyeliner when the design she once wrote in a cut-out album came to fruition.
Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place but lost bronze to Mustafina in a tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team that Americans call "granny" was far ahead.
She blew kisses to the crowd after her freestyle exercise, overwhelmed by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot June 12 while their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The gunman fired about eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car, then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder does not appear to be the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 in possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to examine whether it was related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal the evidence that led them to conclude the attacks are linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Malia, died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found bullet casings and removed a bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mum.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly - the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I won't be able to do that.
I didn't subscribe to it.
Which is not really true - of course you sign up for it, "she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told Edmund might never know them, and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized treatment facility.
"My first response was," I didn't think people were doing that anymore, "" Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund didn't sit and crawl until he was three and he still doesn't speak.
But it is slowly passing through some milestones.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture Edmund invented for "please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not just ordinary sign language - she says Edmund invented his own.
Microcephaly can occur in a variety of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to tell what impact this will have on the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto recalls the emotional toll of an uncertain future.
I kept saying, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't really asked for a lifetime prognosis because I don't expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixie has some reassuring advice for mothers of babies with Zika-related birth defects.
It gets better.
You know things are going to get better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding prompt rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected over the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi have overflowed their banks and threaten widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid has already gone to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said Tangipahoa Parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood danger remains in effect through Saturday across much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could fall on the area.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was in effect through Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set record flood levels over the weekend.
Synoptic Alec Krautmann said both rivers could inundate many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a threat as these swollen rivers will slowly drain into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of floodwaters in Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, said the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby alerted him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming," Hansford said.
It reached the level of my waist.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest tributary she had seen in the 48 years she had lived here.
Hansford said he and the rest of his family have a disability and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were sheltering Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading quickly" as rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann said one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had been saturated with rainfall since Wednesday.
Heavy rain and street flooding led to the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that an adviser in Tangipahoa said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now inundated.
Parish President Robbie Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped in the high water.
Shelters have been opened in Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who have been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to recede," he said.
In the Tangipahoa Parish town of Hammond, about two dozen streets were closed because of high water levels, and sandbags were available for distribution to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flooding we had was in March," said City Manager Lacy Landrum.
It is on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said heavy rain continued to fall on the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Towson said, "and it's still pouring down on the ground."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including to his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to a hospital.
"He was badly hurt, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is listed in critical condition in hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station they expected him to recover.
He had to go to the first grade at the local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old, were also shot.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men may have been the shooter.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been an exchange of gunfire between several gunmen.
Semi-automatic weapon casings, attributed to different copies of the semi-automatic weapon, littered the scene.
It seems like it's definitely been a long battle.
There were shell casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it appears that there were several armed men there and they were actively involved in the shooting, "Philadelphia Police Capt. Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in the arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for several reasons.
First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts on this team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The make-up of this team, augmented by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected but nonetheless masterful gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.
And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of the sport, but it does not look like that in gymnastics clubs across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is Martha Karolyi's last year coaching.
But in reality gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay for tuition, equipment, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban areas that can support the business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get everything from their training, and this is an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnasts "families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both coached their female athletes since they took up gymnastics.
We must create more affordable and accessible gymnastics training for the communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby, and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
At my organizations, we have already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes, located in Harlem, to more than 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Hispanic) and have nurtured national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to grueling work, discipline, and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a life-long positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
It's the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Taking part in sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby, and Madison for this serious demonstration of "Female Power" in winning Team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls from so many backgrounds to be healthy, strong, and successful young women.
Junior doctors set to call further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal rejected
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified contract with British Medical Association bosses, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior doctors have been transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working to improve out-of-hours care.
Dr Helen McCourt, chair of the BMA's junior doctors "committee, said in a statement last night:" Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied fairly to all doctors. "
With just eight weeks to go before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations has been met with reluctance to act and sometimes complete silence from the government.
This is despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
He said: "Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and address the concerns of junior doctors.
If he fails to do so, junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to stage further strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April delayed some 13,000 scheduled operations and 100,000 nursing appointments, while nurses and consultants were brought in to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a modified contract with British Medical Association leaders.
The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer said: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on already stretched teams and services and cause anxiety, physical pain and disruption to patients, carers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns about the role of carers and the corporate reporting policy.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as staff allocation, flexibility of training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, cost of training, mutual recognition of curricula, sabbatical leave, and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the terms reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A £2-a-day drug could reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to benefit from the £2-a-day drug after authorities recommended it be given to more people for longer.
The anti-clotting drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.
NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems from now on.
But now NHS watchdog NICE has recommended it be given to people for four years to rule out the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
Around 140,000 people in England have a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material on artery walls and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot moves, it can travel through the bloodstream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces risk by making blood clots less likely.
Draft guidance from NICE, published today, recommends that people should be given 90mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, around a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack will experience another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor in advance, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information about the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond that period.
PC culture allows vote-rigging to flourish in Muslim areas
Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year over corruption, prompting a government report
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread vote-rigging in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles has attacked the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities because of "excessive sensitivities about race and religion."
The former communities secretary, now an anti-corruption tsar, said religious intimidation of voters was so severe that police should be allowed to set up cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take ID cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters need only provide their name and address.
The report even suggests indelible ink be applied to people's fingers when they cast their ballots, to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Better protection for whistleblowers is needed, Sir Eric said.
He calls for the press to be given greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against electoral fraud, but also to protect local government from the more open culture of corruption and the financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luftur Rahman, should have been removed from office because of a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found Rahman had "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "campaigned on the basis that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or the result of personalization, when a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about postal voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are
His report said: "Evidence has been presented of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote at the will of elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that... government agencies turned a blind eye to such behavior because of excessive sensitivity to" political correctness "about ethnicity and religion."
Cheese Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including suspending political activists from handling postal ballots to stop the "harvesting of votes."
The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent voters from being used to cheat on immigration and privileges.
Consideration is being given to the option of requiring voters to produce ID before voting.
Use indelible ink on people's fingers as soon as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on people's nationality to ensure that they are eligible to vote.
Introduce a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with completed absentee ballots and postal voting envelopes.
Give the police the power to set up cordons around polling stations.
Change the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People's Act.
Make it illegal to take photos at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff force voters to go to the booth one at a time.
Sir Eric has launched a furious attack on the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - the criminal standard of proof - on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the ineffectual "tick-box checks" by the city's electoral registration offices.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten that good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cycling equivalent and other celebrity doppelgangers of the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who turned out to look remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete vying for gold this summer who boasts her own famous twin - at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: US Men's Archer Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
Aside from Kate's twin on the bike path, many people online were quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
US Men's Archer Team member Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after images emerged of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star.
In fact, Archer learned of the social media frenzy and admitted that he had heard he looked like Leo since he was a child.
"Personally, I don't see a huge resemblance, maybe other than the vegetation on my face," Brady told the Huffington Post.
'He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment. '
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarity between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to Choir star Matthew Morrison for years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user thinks Nathan is a 'sporty version' of the Beginning actor
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy brows and lips.
Silver medal swimmer Yuliya Efimova from Russia boasts not only the same tanned skin and blond hair as actress AnnaLynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian, according to fans, looks like a "sporty version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Tough women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same facial shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities
Creating a theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the pair's similar appearance
One Twitter user recently took to the site to vent her delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
Indeed, the US soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerry Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful broad smile, which resembles that of Get Lucky star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish in the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers on CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a stink" and "died like a pig" during a swim.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on board the CBC commentary team to "dilute it with color," could be heard saying, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Too excited, started like a stink, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.
Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'?????"
This idiot didn't realize they were still on air. '
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron MacDonald, with many calling for him to be sacked
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow # ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. # disgusted.
Soon after, Scott Russell, who was hosting the CBC show, apologized live on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize that a comment about a swimming performance was aired.'
It was a poor choice of words, we're sorry it happened. '
SAF ended up apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the remark
Commentator's friend Scott Russell forced to apologise on MacDonald's behalf
The CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments
The network was also quick to apologize and issue a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night we acted swiftly to apologise to our viewers on-air and to our followers on social media.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her personality.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron deeply regrets what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live on air and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be construed as an attack on a person.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for a comment I made last night after the women's relay, 'he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not about her personally. '
'Needless to say, there was no disrespect implied and I'm very sorry. '
Primark shopper insulted woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried what she looked like in them, pulled them together and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and ended up measuring four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place store in Folkestone.
The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf
Mother-of-two Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and left the store without buying anything'.
She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'
Standing in the middle of a shopping mall, she took a pair of panties from a display case, took off her own tights and panties, and put them on.
'She didn't try to find a hiding place to do it - she just stood there, shamelessly. '
'Everyone stared when she took off her panties again and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf. '
She did the same with three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing she liked, getting dressed again and walking out.
'I don't think she cared who was watching her or what she thought of the person who would end up buying the knickers she was trying on. '
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: 'How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home knickers that someone else has already worn and they haven't been washed.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Davidson added: "I conclude that staff may have tried to remove these items of clothing from sale after she left - all the better."
'I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off and they hadn't been washed. '
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of an incident which occurred at our Folkestone store on Tuesday 9 August."
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect yourself from Gun Attacks Using Krav Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com may help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with your own weapon.
If approached from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.
You then squeeze the gun tightly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
A knee to the groin then follows, and as the attacker flees in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the barrel, and step back, keeping the gun pointed at him.
For a front-armed person, the way to do it is similar - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun quickly and twist it so the villain can't shoot.
At the same time, move the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of its grip before backing back and aiming it at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery - unless you are a master krav magician - is to hand over your cash.
Traveller Ian Wright's guide to Europe's dirtiest places
A British traveller has put his immune system and vomiting reflex to a severe test by licking some of the dirtiest and ugliest places in Europe.
Presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, stuck his tongue out at a euro note, Piccadilly Circus railings, a train toilet flush button and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is set to become a film called The Lysone Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength, has produced some surprising results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be utterly disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health workers about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked did him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his gut by traveling the world and eating weird and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to the toilet flush button, the task has undoubtedly tested his immune system
In the film he made, he said: 'Ever since I was a kid, I've been completely carefree about my health and I've pulled a lot of different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test swab showed a luminometer reading of more than 4,000 units.
By comparison, freshly washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer reading was more than 4,000, while freshly washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a film about the traveler called "The Lysone Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he said: 'It's close to one of the worst things I've smelled in the toilet.'
Nothing is dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
Lysone Traveler's Guide to Inner Strength was produced with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to help boost the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio's Senior Vice President of Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and at the same time might explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming session that ended with the idea of "let's call Ian."
They claim interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Rather than just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humour!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way: I would lose respect for Ian if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.'
Naturally, some things were easier for Ian to lick, and some were pretty tough.
I'm glad we were able to film some of those licks. '
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents attributed lactic acid bacteria exclusively to good stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they ate at least occasionally foods containing added lactic acid bacteria.
Family of bullies destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house on eve of eviction
A family of bullies have left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for bullying their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock have been kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked housing cooperative officials found the property in a state of disrepair.
Walls were left with gaping holes, floors were ripped open, rubbish was strewn across the floor and graffiti was scrawled on the walls.
The family have now been relocated and are believed to be living in a private flat
Donna McEvoy, of Cornwall Housing, said she feared he would not be saved.
She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people here and I don't think people should live like that.
There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property is likely to be known as the not-so-nice aspect of Cornwall.
This family is infamous, and their name is infamous.
The couple have three sons who live in the property at times, and police say the family's reign of terror included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for anti-social behaviour in June.
Old rubbish was found in several rooms of a house that could be demolished
Floor boards at a house where drugs have been sold in the past have been pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights in the street and regularly called police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from their home this week after they were given an extended period of 11 weeks to leave voluntarily.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbours who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said: 'They didn't care.'
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'This morning we couldn't sleep. '
We got up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they have finally left, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood policing manager, said the family had failed to co-operate with local authorities.
The family had lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called
Rubbish and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the council house
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last resort that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her watching neighbours.
I appreciate all the work put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.
I hope this development will provide some comfort to neighbours and send a message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their 20s at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the piles of rubbish that surround the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, accessories and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of class B drugs with intent to supply.
She said the money went to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many of the house's rooms were daubed with graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with tenancy rules
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This is a message to those who feel they can behave without blaming the accuser, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior, 'she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were left terrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
Tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, who love to soak up the sun, feared for their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane flew incredibly low
The Air Force said he was on a training flight but insisted there was no safety risk
This is the moment terrified tourists start to panic as a low-flying plane swooped over a crowded beach.
Dramatic footage shows the military plane flying almost within touching distance of the hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Holidaymakers jumped to their feet as they became understandably concerned about the noise from the plane's engines, but were unable to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: 'It flew quite low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash.'
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to fall on me.'
Tourists on Aveiro beach were terrified when the plane appeared out of the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low because it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires damaged mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force issued a statement today saying the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - thick fog and smog from wildfires that reduced visibility
The plane was on a training flight and the pilot was tasked with detecting fishing boats as part of the mission
The HACCP system has been mandatory for food services for more than a year, but the majority of cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Inspections become more active, and businesses face fines of up to 1 million roubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food producers and transporters, as well as for companies in the field of food services in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Business inspections by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials issue fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents...").
Failure to comply with the regulations as a whole will cost the enterprise 600 thousand roubles for the first violation and 1 million roubles for the second.
HACCP was invented in the US in the 1960 "s as a risk-based system for handling and preventing food.
Back then, it was about food safety for astronauts.
The system is now used by all food companies, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and the European Union.
HACCP has been operating in the CU since February 2015.
Businesses had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulations of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food industries, not restaurateurs, explained Elena Tsereteli, Head of the Public Council.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause a stir, because their target audience - families with children - is already getting ready for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government asking it to allow charters now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing high-quality and affordable sea holidays is insoluble, because in resorts of Krasnodar Krai and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities have already been booked by the end of September," note the authors of the letter and emphasize that the opening of charter operations in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian marine tourism products.
According to the North-West Regional Office of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (RST), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when charters will be renewed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, airplanes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the required flights, "says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Department of the RST.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not affect the balance of power in the market too much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are getting ready for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who are able to relax spontaneously, "says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand roubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, there is no need to count on excitement - the bulk of travel has already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to wait for excitement.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Opening charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season," agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from personal income tax of statutory compensation payments, within the limits of approved norms, related to compensation for damage caused by an injury or other damage to health.
Milk is issued to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the established norms provided for in Article 222 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation.
Moreover, the rules and conditions for issuance are established by Order No. 45n of the Ministry of Health of Russia of 16.02.2009.
According to this document, milk or other equivalent foodstuffs are distributed free of charge to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions resulting from the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
Proceeding from these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia, in the letter under consideration, came to the conclusion that, on the basis of Article 217 (3) (2) of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, income in the form of the cost of milk issued to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions is exempt from taxation in accordance with the Rules and Conditions approved by Order No. 45n of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009.
Moscow Gazstroybank remained without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, 12 August 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the credit institution Joint Stock Commercial Bank GAZSTROIBANK, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK pursued a high-risk lending policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
Adequate risk assessment at the request of the supervisory authority and a reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the emergence of grounds for the credit institution to implement bankruptcy prevention measures.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in dubious transit operations.
A temporary administration has been appointed at the bank for the period of validity until the appointment of a bankruptcy administrator or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of a credit institution are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
JSC JSCB GAZSTROIBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It should be recalled that, in accordance with Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation," the payment of insurance indemnity to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, is envisaged in the amount of 100% of the balance, but not more than 1.4 million roubles in total per depositor.
Payments, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than 26 August 2016.
According to the reporting data, as of August 1, 2016, JSCB GAZSTROIBANK was ranked 335th in the banking system of the Russian Federation in terms of assets.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of all this - as a tombstone and testament to others, that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice," Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reid says Clinton will stay loyal to Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace the last Supreme Court justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicts Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he had not spoken directly with Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and was simply making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "henchmen" and "accomplices" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
Treats claims erotic calendars are for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s-inspired Pirelli calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are focused on finding the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to get back to showing timeless and classic nudity, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given reminders about unscrupulous online stores.
Moscow is going to issue a leaflet that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported by Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the agency's experts are preparing a memo that will help citizens choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
This will include general information and a legislative framework, rules for the delivery of goods, and ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will contain recommendations on how to make a claim and so on, "Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memo is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on Rospotrebnadzor's website for Moscow, and it is also planned to issue a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement naming the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in Crimea.
Individuals from Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts have been detained.
Among them are Yevgeny Alexandrovich Panov and Andrey Romanovich Zakhtey.
"All of them confess," the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of Zaporozhye region, Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt during an interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violating antitrust law amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future, "stated Alexei Dotsenko, Deputy Head of the FAS.
During the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the app store Google Play only on the condition that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is a search engine, which must be placed on the main screen of a smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates Article 10 (1) of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the enforcement of the injunction will provide an opportunity to develop competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial impact on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, including multinational corporations, "noted Elena Zaeva, Head of the Department for Regulation of Communications and Information Technologies of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects 16 Russian stores of collusion.
The New Book chain was fined for selling the book "50 days before my suicide."
The New Book chain of stores has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 days before my suicide," reports the Moscow City News Agency.
According to Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating suicidal behavior among children and adolescents."
The Ostankino District Court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for distributing information products to children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine and confiscation of 49 copies of printed materials seized by the Rospotrebnadzor Department.
A source at New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking for the presence of the book "50 days before my suicide."
An evening in memory of Ernst the Nezavisimaya will be held in Moscow.
An evening in memory of sculptor Ernst Nezavisimayny will be held in Moscow, TASS reports.
The event will take place on August 15 at the Central House of Writers.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to Unknown in the United States in person.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember him in his native land, "stated the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It said it was important for the sculptor's widow, Anna Graham, and his friends around the world.
Close friends of the Unknown are invited to the evening, including the poet Evgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, Irina Antonov, President of the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia, Vladimir Medinsky, the Head of the Department of Culture of Moscow, Alexander Kibovsky, and Leonid Pechatnikov, Deputy Mayor of Moscow.
Earlier, it was reported that Ernst Nezavisimaya's relatives plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably before 14 August.
The ultimate vinyl consumer: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rush to clog the comments section with crude insults under the pseudonym Not Alone Men of Medium Years, this claim is based on factual evidence.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is driven not by a boom among the two-millennial generation, who want to be imbued with the novelty of a material object, but by middle-aged nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those in the 18-24 age group are the least likely.
Nor is it simply an act of amateurs collecting - it has emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy solitude (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walked down the middle of a busy Soho street, in a modest grey suit and gesturing violently before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "So, let's see."
So, let's take a look.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and grit - hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores are now filled with buildings once occupied by independent sellers - a few fantastic specialist music shops remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, in which I stand close to various people in some of these stores and try to gauge their age and emotional state through observation.
Glasgow-born Stewart, 55, who I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably in her 20s), is in London for a half-day meeting and strolling the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me an e-mail picture, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles stems partly from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and stranded.
"A lot of what I buy is the late 60s, the early 70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
This is my flaw.
Wez, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to redeem their old records.
Judging by the conversations I have had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records, "he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl renaissance artists of a certain age.
And what about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
One only has to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable society to like-minded people.
According to Wez, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel the shock of the digital world and prefer to retreat into the constancy of familiar record envelopes, items that evoke memories of serene youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material things as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
As a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's an easy way to get your head around it.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from a stack of records.
An ICM poll in April found that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don't have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled as I flicked through a stack of Bosanovo compilations.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what Johnny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe, has noticed (count: three middle-aged men).
"Someone came in recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf, "" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the stuff, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, in their early twenties, who are just getting acquainted with it.
Fopp, who now devotes almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less laid-back than in the aforementioned stores - the latest synth and sex-pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers - it's nice to see diversity in its customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but the excruciating psychological trauma is difficult to establish by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes looking at the various records on sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends the money.
She doesn't earn much, she says, so collecting records isn't a good option.
It is expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is... "she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have spawned a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion of looking at denim tight shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute, before a father and his daughter discuss buying a Crosley player.
To the left is the staircase, the wall of which is stacked with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern style and classics, the obligatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking - perhaps because they are just decoration, some so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is real "artistic vinyl."
But, given that any focus on these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for a while longer, there is little to complain about.
Not surprisingly, the segment of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends the most money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and on online forums.
These people probably work full-time in schools or offices.
But they clearly don't spend Thursday mornings strolling through record stores on Berwick Street, flipping through records and avoiding the glances of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark is longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies the sharks, said the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long
French court rejects bid to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods ranging from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
Calais Prefecture has argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the camp's growing population.
They said makeshift shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to kick out the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the problems of the Calais prefecture were "fully understood."
Judge Jean-François Molla said groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was the camp's Jungle Book cafe for children, which is run for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some as young as eight."
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000 - the highest ever - after a surge in arrivals over the summer.
Neighborhood libraries invite young residents of Svoboda for educational programs.
This week, branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema, and even Physical Education Day.
Programs are aimed at children's audiences, so for the most part they will take place in the form of games.
Today, on August 10, Library Branch No. 2, in the Bay District, invites you to the cruise presentation "My town is small."
On 11 August, the local history hour "I live in this city, I know this city" will be held in Library Branch No. 1.
On the same day, a multimedia lesson entitled "Land native past destiny" will be held in Library Branch No. 2.
And in Library Branch No. 4 in Surazhevka, there is a game program called "Film, Film, Film."
On Sunday, 14 August, Library Branch No. 3 will hold a game programme, "Physical Culture-Hello!," for children from the northern microdistrict.
Britain settle for silver in rugby sevens after Fiji masterclass allows them to take gold
Great Britain's impressive run in the Rugby Sevens was brought to a crushing halt at the final hurdle by Fiji in Thursday night's final when they were comprehensively beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in ball possession, breakdown, evasion, support play, line running and brute force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.
Defeat came with not too much consolation in the form of silver - Britain's third of the day - and they could be proud of their efforts in the inaugural Olympic rugby sevens tournament, which saw them beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa en route.
The painful beating of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could come back to haunt them in the final.
But, against all odds, Fiji's form was the best of the 15-man squad.
It may be some consolation to Great Britain - but probably not - that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, the former England boss from Wimbledon.
It's been a bit of a journey for Great Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here, they lost just one.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is remarkable.
Fiji started superbly, repelling England's attempts to intercept the ball for fun.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau dived into the corner.
With four minutes on the clock, Jerrir Tuwai added another down the right flank, which was converted.
12-0 and England barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's superb interception kept mountain man Leon Nakarawa from scoring the third, but it only held Fiji back.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua touched down in the right corner and England were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa added another after the restart and the clock was still more than a minute away... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish England interception attempts and stormed over the line to score.
The run led to 29-0 at the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby sevens, while Great Britain are still mastering the craft.
Which is pretty much what it is.
Great Britain made massive substitutions at half-time and they clogged the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by first-half standards was good until Joshua Tuisova went over after some brilliant Fijian interplay.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for Great Britain with a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game was long in the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire Fiji's exhilarating approach.
Mata Viliame embellished a Fijian cake that did not need embellishment with another try in the dying seconds.
The whistle went, the Fijians embraced and Great Britain fell to the turf, utterly defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-final while Great Britain edged South Africa in a tense semi-final of one try each - the difference being the British record.
Kyle Brown put the Boks ahead in the first half but Dan Norton, with some superb footwork, broke the line and scored under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late interception attempt from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15-aside team, Anthony, secured the win - and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by coach's battle with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold at these Games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found extra meaning to their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in that boat, an echo of coach Robin Williams as they sought a second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th unbeaten performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with swan elegance, does not fully reflect the nature of the triumph.
Behind every rowing gold is a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to the incremental victories that matter, and there are no hands that have been more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous thing to do.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were fortunate that he could begin treatment early in 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if that may be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to be paid, so I had to recover quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they were talking a few steps.
Here's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it does make it a bit bigger.
In the moments after the victory, their first thoughts were for Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own emotions.
Stanning, a captain in the Artillery Regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her, said: "I've been an emotional wreck this week, maybe it's a bit too much, but it means so much."
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin too.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a huge thank you to him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very much in phase.
Helen called out: 'Stay in the process, stay in the process.'
Now it is important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn't try to do anything spectacular.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to race well and go out and win that race, which we did.
The couple will need a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at next month's wedding, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better, "she said.
The government has extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the deadline for the destruction of foodstuffs prohibited for import into Russia.
The decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo on countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions because of the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
Some agricultural products, raw materials, and foodstuffs from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, and Liechtenstein are prohibited from entering Russia.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products fell under the ban.
Disposal of food imported into the country in violation of the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of banned products were withdrawn from sale.
Hunting for the "forbidden woman"
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing precipitation and lowering air temperatures.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees Celsius.
For example, on Saturday night in Moscow there will be some short rain in places, thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 15 m / s are possible.
Rain is expected during the day with thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 12-17 m / s.
Rain with thunderstorms is also forecast for Oryol, Kursk and Voronezh regions, Dni.ru reports.
Precipitation is unlikely in the next working week.
A WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators, and palm oil contravened the organization's rules.
Import rates exceed the obligations assumed by Russia when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has decided against the Russian Federation," reads a statement on the organization's official website.
However, the arbitrators emphasized in their conclusion that the EU did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "comprehensive."
Russia, in turn, has promised to adjust import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in a statement from the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement by the Government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US behavior in resolving disputes at the WTO undermines the organization's principles of debate.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union, and other WTO members because of the Americans "refusal to confirm South Korean judge Jang Song-hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization created in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
The head of the Presidential Administration has been replaced
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Sergei Ivanov's former deputy, Anton Vaino, to head his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has reshuffled the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino stated during the meeting that he considers important the anti-corruption work that Ivanov began to carry out as head of the Presidential Administration, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts believe that the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration is transparent and understandable, and the reshuffle will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who had been working in the presidential administration for quite a long time, effectively organized the activities of the AP.
In his place came Deputy Chief of Staff Anton Vaino, a man who knows the specifics of this work very well.
Poland admits that it will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to its reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by Boguslaw Mazec, Vice President of Finance for the Polish company.
TASS reports his words.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main areas of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway, "Mazec said.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in the supply of gas to Poland.
On Friday, 12 August, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier delivered almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas to it in the first half of 2016, which is 30% higher than in 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share of PGNIG purchases increased to 49.8%, compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, Poland's antimonopoly authority failed to agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Moreover, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Management Board of the holding.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream-2 will take place in 2017, and an auction for its installation is planned for autumn 2016.
At the end of May, it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, stated Alexander Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company.
He reminded that in the first quarter of this year, Poles only increased by 42% the purchase of gas from the Russian Federation.
The Deputy Chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact that the Polish PGNIG filed an application with the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not yet mean that the negotiations are terminated.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court in order to obtain a reduction in the purchase price for Russian gas.
It should be recalled that the representative of the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, reported that the Polish authorities decided not to extend the gas supply contract with Gazprom.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the representative of the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure, Piotr Naimski, stated that his country could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new Baltic Pipe liquefied natural gas supply terminal, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two strands of an offshore gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine's border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy of the CMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the CMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, answering a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, with no incidents affecting security there.
Observers monitored what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video has emerged online of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport, which rolled 400 metres off the runway and landed on its left wing.
The video was published by 360 TV.
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to safety; there were no injuries.
The aircraft itself was transported to a parking lot.
Ufa airport is operating as usual.
The Volga Region Investigative Department for Transport of the TFR was engaged in clarifying the reason for the airliner's hard landing.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine gas, but UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, believes that the fact of what happened is indisputable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine gas, appeared on 2 August.
At that time, the opposition claimed that aircraft dropped bombs with a toxic substance in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down the previous day, but Moscow called the accusations a hoax.
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense blamed the opposition group, Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zinki, for the incident.
It soon became known that there were two toxic gas bombs.
This was confirmed to the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I smelled gas, my eyes started to burn, and it became difficult to breathe," the publication quotes an eyewitness as saying.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened."
The prohibition of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights defenders documented 35 cases of chlorine gas being used by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition."
Complicating the situation in Aleppo is the daily shelling of its districts and the fact that terrorists are preventing residents from leaving the city.
According to Reuters, the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in hostilities.
The current regime of a daily three-hour lull in the fighting is considered "insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped."
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour cease-fire would be needed each week to bring aid into the city and evacuate the sick and wounded.
"We have to send bulk cargo with a convoy of trucks to an area where the roads are virtually destroyed and those that remain are mined," Mr. Egeland said. "But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table."
Consultations in Geneva between US and Russian representatives on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
Amid the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city, Russia announced on August 11 the imposition of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will take effect daily from Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to ensure the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of growing international pressure on Moscow to scale down the military operation and facilitate the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people have been killed in a series of explosions at resorts in Thailand.
Several explosions struck southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed and 19 were wounded.
The epicenter of the explosions was the city of Hua Hin.
Ten foreigners, citizens of four countries, were among the victims, and no Russians were among them.
No terrorist group has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the Interior Ministry was quick to say that the Islamists were not involved.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military in charge of the country.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
Since the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few sectors to show growth.
In 2016, 14 million people have already visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been detained, said Police Colonel Krisana Patanacharoen.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country "is sure that they are not connected with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions, "Mr Patanacharoen said.
But we do know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are in fact local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sikrit.
With the Thai junta making defending the monarchy one of its top priorities, the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to statements by Police General Sithichai Srispacharoenrath, the bombs were detonated remotely within half an hour of each other.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four killed was a Thai girl selling street food.
The identities of the remaining victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, they include four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Federal Tourism Agency reported.
Local experts also link the explosions to the referendum held on August 7, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitution drafting commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was entirely appointed by the military and had a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the country's army, Prayuth Chan-ocha.
The move, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military established the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, and dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok came to be in a state of emergency
Thailand's government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in central Bangkok at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests was taking place, injuring 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were carried out by unknown individuals on motorcycles.
The authorities have tightened security in the capital and deployed military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sukhoi Log, the development of conditions has begun.
Kommersant has learned that the government has been asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit, while retaining two key restrictions.
It is proposed to exclude from the auction companies where 25% or more is owned by foreigners and those bidders in whose capital there will be no minimum 25% state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not already risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and auction terms for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk Region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two Kommersant sources familiar with the situation told.
The draft was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them said.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed to Kommersant that the project has been submitted to the government.
A representative of Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Khloponin, who oversees subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction may be announced as early as August, immediately after the issuance of the government order, and, taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place as early as October," the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said.
According to Kommersant, the project retained two key requirements for potential participants, which were spelled out in the version that was sent to the ministries and FOIVAM for approval in July (Kommersant has one).
The first is the presence of at least 25% of state participation in the capital of the bidders.
The second is denial of access to the auction to companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic companies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law mentioned in the draft, as Kommersant already wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to participate in the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log belongs to the subsoil of federal significance (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment confirmed that the draft "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies," but declined to comment on the details until the government order.
The requirement for state participation in the capital of auction participants was put forward by Irkutsk Region, the Ministry of Natural Resources told Kommersant in December 2015 and was later confirmed by the Governor of the region, Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor, Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec."
Kommersant's interlocutors do not specify who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners.
"But this is in the spirit of the times: not to give up control of the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," says a Kommersant source familiar with the auction preparations.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoy, stated that foreigners "can join the consortium" if the bidders attract them "as a financial structure, as technological partners."
Kommersant's interlocutors consider it unlikely that the government will correct the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered to be a consortium of the largest gold miner in the Russian Federation, PJSC Polyus, controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son Said, and Rostec.
According to Kommersant, in July, the partners established a joint venture called SL Gold, where Polyus holds 51% of the shares and Rostec's structure, RT-GR, has 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polyus told Kommersant that it was "certainly interested in this asset" and had all the necessary expertise and resources for its development.
"But a final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the terms," Polyus added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision rests with the Russian government, Kommersant sources said.
Russia's GV Gold and Canada's Kinross, which is developing assets in Chukotka, have announced the possibility of participating in the development of Sukhoi Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
In December 2015, Sergei Kashuba, Head of the Union of Gold Producers of the Russian Federation, estimated Kommersant's investment in Sukhoi Log at $2.5-4 billion.
Most potential bidders are deterred not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious additional exploration of reserves and technologies for working with complex ores are needed, Kommersant's industry interlocutors explain.
On the pension market, the largest M & A deal has started - KIT Finance Pension Administrator has launched the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, an NPF with savings of about 373 billion roubles will be created on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
Yesterday, the owner of 100% of the funds, LLC KIT Finance Pension Administrator, announced the launch of the procedure for merging four pension funds - KIT Finance, Promagrofond, Heritage, and Gazfond Pension Savings.
"The reorganization is being carried out in coordination with the Central Bank in compliance with the requirement not to worsen the terms of existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The merger is being carried out on the basis of Gazfond Pension Savings.
According to the CEO of this NPF, Oleg Byaloshitsky, merging the funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each fund, and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated date for completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF Gazfond Pension Savings will become the largest player in the M & A market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion roubles.
According to the statements on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - KIT Finance Pension Administrator - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF Gazfond (35%).
However, the merger itself was launched much later than its competitors.
Thus, NPF Future, controlled by O1 Group, took over Stalfond at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is merging the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"The merger into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," notes Nikolai Sidorov, CEO of NPF Future.
Active work on consolidation of funds has been underway in the Safmar pension group since April: NPFs European, Education and Science, and Regionfond are due to merge into NPF Safmar by the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF Doverie will join them.
"The merger of the funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and costs," the Safmar pension group noted.
The pause in the merger of funds, which was sustained by the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator," can be caused by several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NPF could not buy back more than 40% of the issue of infrastructure bonds into which the group was actively placed.
After amendments were made to the resolution of the Central Bank in March of this year, there are no more such restrictions on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator.
If necessary, the entire issue can be redeemed by one major player, "says Yuri Nogin, Director of ACRA's Financial Institutions Ratings Group.
Several heads of NPFs from the top-15 by assets cite the division of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, personnel appointments in a single fund, which the owners of the group had to approve, as another possible reason for the pause.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The Gazfond NPF also did not respond to Kommersant's request.
Although consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and expensive undertaking, it will be worthwhile over the long term.
According to Sergei Okolesnov, CEO of the consulting company Pension Partner, Gazfond Pension Savings has fewer outflows, and the merger will stabilize the base of the group's other funds.
At the same time, the more successful experience of NPFs KIT Finance and Promagrofond in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank to the processes and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, according to Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicative functions will definitely cover the possible costs of the merger," Mr. Mitrofanov notes.
Sergei Okolesnov estimates the cost of merging the four funds at 30-50 million roubles.
"Expenditures on the maintenance of four funds of this size amount to about 400 million roubles per year, and in the medium term, consolidation will actually halve the budget," Mr. Okolesnov is convinced.
The kindest Disney film, "Pete and his Dragon," has been released in Russia.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a delightful dragon, heartwarming history and country songs are enough to make you believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by the dragon, who became both a gentle nanny and a devoted friend to the human cub.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot, after a puppy from a book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, with his loincloth-clad face, he is no longer distinguishable from another clever woodpecker, Mowgli.
As it is, Pete is discovered by a redheaded female huntsman, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively felling the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the dragon's existence, but also help save it.
Pete is undergoing an accelerated course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code in their hearts, and smile more brightly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too terrible for the viewer to truly hate or fear.
Even Gavin, who has discovered a hunt for an atypical dweller in the forests under his control, is far from an incorrigible villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be anything but scary, with a good bulldog snout, an airliner wing span, and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon purrs amusingly, purrs, even grunts and, fortunately, does not speak, but he always wants to be stroked, which makes him very different from all the well-known cinematic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and mannerisms provide such a high degree of emotional engagement that, in the most tense moments, not only the young audience, but also the adults begin to sob desperately into three streams.
Young Oakes Figley is also surprisingly good in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford masterfully portrays the canonical grandfather that literally every child would be happy to have.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Pete's Dragon" of 1977, mediocre from nose to tail and remembered only for a mix of animation and feature films, into this summer's most heartwarming film?
Nothing short of a miracle helped.
Lowry essentially took only two things from the original for his painting: an orphan Pete and a dragon.
Overboard were musical numbers and most of the odd jokes.
In this kind tale you can read features borrowed from "Bambi," "Alien," and many other sweet children's films.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" is not as stunningly beautiful as "The Jungle Book," and it lacks the cunning villain that Cate Blanchett turned out to be in the role of stepmother in the new "Cinderella."
But this naive film is no less successful in helping to believe in miracles and good in Disney's best traditions.
By the way, director Lowry will get the keys to Disney's magic castle once again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story of "Peter Pan."
The tandem of David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, who worked on "Pete and His Dragon," is part of an ambitious new project about an immature boy based on James Barry's fairy tale of the same name.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov to face new charges
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in their client's case.
We learned that the prosecutor's office made such a submission from investigators just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in a court hearing on the issue of restricting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the hearing did not take place, and investigators informed us of the prosecutor's recommendation, "RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze as saying.
She said the prosecutor's office pointed out to investigators the discrepancy between the classification of the case and the materials collected.
Now investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with different arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As Kommersant reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the indictment of the RBC journalist the formulations on "unsettling the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government by illegal means."
The correspondent of Kommersant Boscosport, Aleksandr Zilbert, lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the home of the Russian team, dined in the local canteen, and even passed the WADA test afterwards.
Life doesn't seem to stop there for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village is ongoing, as some athletes finish their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7: 30 a.m., the heads of all the Olympic delegations stretch into one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational everyday issues, "says Igor Kazikov, Head of the Sports Delegation of the Russian Olympic Team." Despite the fact that the house where ours are housed, consider it to be an exemplary one - it was one of the first to be put into operation and was shown to all the inspectors, even there are still some defects.
Now with hot water problems, then, sorry, with toilet bowls.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to arrive, but only by spraying some substance on the floor, and that's it.
They have some innovative floors, you see.
They say you can't wash them humanely.
Yes, we know these floors - ordinary laminate flooring!
In general, we succeeded in changing the cleaning company and now everything is OK with it.
The Olympic Village is such a Yuzhnoe Butovo, a sleeping area surrounded on one side by mountains, on the other by an impressive moat, sometimes flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is also a two-meter iron fence along the entire perimeter, along which machine-gun men walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
A huge Russian flag hangs on one of the 18-storey buildings - this house has been completely given to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately identify what problems are probably the most pressing for the domestic team.
Two notices hang at the front desk: a printed "Please do not throw paper in the toilet!" and a handwritten "I will accept badges as a gift.
The counter itself is littered with booklets.
Their cheerful colouring contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Information on infectious diseases for those travelling to Rio de Janeiro," "First aid in the event of drowning, ingestion of a foreign body into the airways, loss of consciousness - the stages of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation," "First aid in the event of burns, heat stroke, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is, on the whole, encouraging.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
But not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, the Russian team has a medical center at its disposal, which is ready at any moment to provide the residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical centre is the very headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspirational poster: "Against all odds, we will prevail!"
And, of course, poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
Let fewer of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia not retreat, not break!
And for an even more uplifting message, hang an announcement: "Dear Brothers and Sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alexeev is taking spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a moleben and other services by phone...
In general, there is a Centre for Meditation and Religious Rites for members of all faiths in the village.
And Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the congestion of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs recommended for use during a fire.
And, in the darkness, I stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
By all accounts, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I suppose that at any moment they were ready to rush to wash the innovative floors and decided to arrange a quiet hour for themselves directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with an old acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampolines, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
By and large, there is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live by two, the beds, of course, are almost right up against each other, but it is not critical.
The bathroom is one for four, but spacious.
The wardrobe, of course, is funny, made of fabric, does not inspire confidence, but things can be put in.
"No, you guessed it, they've run out of tea!" says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one if only because it has a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
Here they give out 60 thousand servings a day absolutely free of charge.
Menu options include "Best of Brazil," "World Cuisines," "Asian Dishes," and "Pizza, Pasta."
The latter option, as I have seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soup in any of the departments of the giant restaurant.
What soup? - Kuznetsova wonders. - There is no tea!
It's good to have a Chinese takeaway with me, custard.
And the kettle.
But in general, as you can see, the food on our courts is even worse.
There is at least something to choose from, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese - as well as an indication of the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
And quite, I must confess, it was edible.
I don't even understand why there is such a queue all the time at the local McDonald's.
Our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) - are waiting for the well-fed, relaxed and, one might say, "warm" athletes on their way out of the restaurant.
They lure you with a clever quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They provoke, you might say!
To receive a gift, you must correctly answer at least eight out of ten questions.
There are questions in Russian! - the girl from WADA attacked me.
But she attacked the wrong man.
That is, I harnessed myself in a patriotic impulse, of course.
The situation worsened with the second question: "If I received a notification of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?"
I settled on option B: "No - I have one hour."
I have lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that there is no room for complacency from WADA.
In general, you should report immediately.
Well, on the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I had difficulty following a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (which I do!), I could use supplements to get "extra nutrients to boost my performance."
No, they won't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not strictly prohibited, but strongly dissuades in a few sentences.
WADA is playing it dishonest!
How's it going, Russia? "the quiz's host mockingly asks.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and all our bloodied team.
So I concentrated and won the unfortunate t-shirt with my last effort.
Know, as the saying goes, our own!
In a triumphant mood, I wandered into the fitness centre next door.
I got carried away with counting the exercise machines.
I hit 250.
I was surprised to note that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it is the right thing to do?
Let those who don't know how to play train!
But in a nearby polyclinic, one of our boys was sitting.
In line to see an ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, no shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the rest of the village, wherever you spit, there is a device for distributing condoms.
It has an inspiring message on it: "Celebrate with the condom!"
All that remains is to twist the iron, which resembles the door lock handle, and the condom, made of natural latex from the Amazon, readily falls out of the apparatus.
I took one for myself, as a memento.
The athletes will not leave - they have brought 450 thousand of them.
There is a whole entertainment centre in the Olympic Village just for the celebration and idle pastime.
Next to it, just in case, stands an informative plaque reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is awash with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange devices that look like video simulators.
What is this? - I ask a friend in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team, who is actively using a strange toy.
Of course, he could simply say that he does not want to talk to a man in the uniform of the Russian national team, and that's it.
Here, by the way, by some strange coincidence of circumstances, there is a ripple in the eyes from the boys in zhovto-blakite.
The most playing team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to walk around the whole village, visiting every nook and cranny of the village.
But if you walk, rather than ride in electric cars, you will find the home of the Canadian team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restoration bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (but you still can't wait for the queue of Chinese philatelists), and a bank, and a lost property office, and a photo booth.
And late in the evening, exhausted, you will sit down by an olive tree hung with multicolored ribbons in memory of the athletes "friends and relatives who left the world.
To the accompaniment of a machine randomly spraying an insect-killing liquid, you will think of eternity.
That is about the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with bated breath as the Australians nearly punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know: I received the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the heats at the XXXI Olympic Games first.
I may even be the only Muscovite who saw it happen - except, of course, those who watched the competition at Carioca that evening.
Only a true fan can understand this.
Imagine: a muted Moscow night.
Neighbors below - as always by 1am - wake up and start shouting at each other, innocently but very loudly.
And move the furniture menacingly.
The kitchen is leaking - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the television schedule, so I just kept the channels Match, First and, just in case, Russia under my control - even though it makes almost no sense.
"Russia" is the homeland of replays, all sports there for some reason are recorded.
There, the series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, for "Match" - the whole evening a young man shouted in news broadcasts first about the great semi-final between Deriglazov and Shanaeva, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
Instead, basketball is the US v Australia.
By the way, I can say nothing bad about this decision.
The Australians were level, they won the first half.
They put in place Americans who were deluded by their own greatness.
As a result, they did lose, but, as they now say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
That's all well and good, but the fight with Di Francisca is coming up, and on the screen no changes.
In a slight panic, I start flipping through the channels.
It feels like they're playing for the second time in a row.
Okay, we're going deep into cable.
There is no fencing at any of the thematic "Matches."
And, in my feeling, the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweet broadcasts of some sports sites do not suit me.
Cramped surfing produces unexpected but brilliant results.
The First website, it turns out, broadcasts live technical broadcasts of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova is excellent on the counter-attack, goes ahead on points - and obviously starts to buy time.
The Italian plays out almost the entire lead.
Ours is one point ahead, with just over two seconds to go.
Di Francisca lunges at Deriglazova, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian gives an injection.
Victory!
A few seconds later, an Olympic messenger on my phone notifies me of my fourth gold medal.
As it turns out, I am the first to see it with my own eyes.
Crazy, loyal, involved.
The Spiritual Board of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the MRB ordered its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force young Tatars to "learn their native language."
The office says this "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand Tatar.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the whole audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the MRB of Tatarstan unanimously adopted a decision to conduct Friday sermons in mosques of the Republic only in Tatar.
As stated by the Mufti of Tatarstan, Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language."
"For those who will say that it is" difficult, "we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge in every large mosque," Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today sermons in all mosques "should already be in the Tatar language."
He reminded that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with standard sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough "can thoroughly prepare for them."
The ROM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the mufti, Friday sermons in the districts are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques had previously used predominantly Russian.
In particular, as indicated by the mufti, this was practiced in Burnaevskaya Mosque, Zakabannaya Mosque and Eniler Mosque.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, the leadership sets a task that all students are proficient in both official languages of the Republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any infringement of non-Tatar Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin emphasized, explaining that the sermon itself "is not mandatory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the namaz itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and the mosques will retain lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of pushing Tatar out of mosques.
Apart from Russian and Tatar, other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in sermons in the Republic, according to him.
The decision of the OMB was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress of the Tatars (WCT).
Head of the Executive Committee of the WCT, Rinat Zakirov, told Kommersant: "Mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to disappear from this sphere.
He noted that conducting sermons only in the Tatar language is "the will of the imams themselves," but the Executive Committee of the WCT "considers this to be the right thing to do."
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who conducted sermons in Russian, are ready to comply with the DUM's decision, but believe that parishioners will have difficulty understanding the clerics.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, it will be difficult for them.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of Burnaevskaya Mosque, Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, sermons in the Russian language are closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on Allah.
Allah will show the way out of this situation, "he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
They are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That is why we switched to the Russian language four years ago," says the imam.
He believes that sermons in the Tatar language will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience."
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
Simply, the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For example, it will only be easier for me, because Tatar is my native language," Gabdulla Galiullin concluded.
The former director of the FSIN was put on trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office has approved an indictment in a criminal case investigated by the Main Investigations Directorate of the FSIN for embezzlement of budgetary funds allocated to the needs of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
The former head of the prison agency, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy will appear in court, causing damage to the FSIN in the amount of more than 2.7 billion roubles.
The capital prosecutor's office referred to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, Alexander Reimer, his former deputy, Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise "Center for Information and Technical Support and Communications of the Federal Penitentiary Service" (FSUE CITOS), Viktor Oreschelenov.
Depending on their role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are charged by the Main Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Moscow under Article 285 (3) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers entailing grave consequences) and Article 159 (4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, as part of an organized group, on an especially large scale).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222 (1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the FSIN, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the state treasury budgetary funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems for controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
In order to steal budgetary money, the members of the group developed a scheme according to which an enterprise under their control, FSUE CITOS, with which the relevant government contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including "electronic bracelets," and sold at prices that were several times higher.
Despite the fact that the Federal State Unitary Enterprise TsITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, or facilities to accommodate production facilities that would allow for the creation of a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets," five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion roubles were concluded between it and the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion roubles were deposited in the accounts of the Samara branch of the FSUE, of which 1.2 billion roubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash were personally received by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of his accomplices, the criminal case against whom has been separated into separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the fraud, was found to have ammunition for an award pistol of unknown origin, which led to additional charges against him.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a lawsuit against the accused for compensation for material damage in the amount of 2.7 billion roubles.
Footballer Hakan Şükür is suspected of involvement in the putsch.
Turkish authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Hakan Şükür, a former footballer and then member of parliament, and conducted searches of his family's two homes.
A star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Şükür is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with last month's attempted coup.
The forward, who ended his sporting career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an "armed terrorist group."
This is the Hizmet movement, a society linked to a prominent Turkish cleric and opposition figure, Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdoğan who he considers the mastermind of the July 15 military coup attempt.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the United States, and Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Şükür today, and police have already carried out searches at two houses owned by the family of the former footballer.
According to investigators, Fethullah Gülen's organization included, in addition to Hakan Şükür himself, his father.
But neither the former footballer nor his family were there.
He and his family now live in the US.
During his time as a football player, Hakan Şükür defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino," "Inter" and "Palermo," as well as English "Blackburn."
True, he never spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Şükür is still the most efficient striker of the Turkish national team: he has 112 matches for the national team and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Şükür resigned from his parliamentary post as a result of a corruption investigation surrounding Erdoğan's party and his inner circle.
According to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, arrest warrants were issued for at least 42 journalists in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and having ties to the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the US.
Given the gravity of the charges, media workers could face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a chain of cinemas only for domestic films.
"I would create a chain of cinemas exclusively for Russian films, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for foreign-made films," he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for viewers with major Hollywood films.
More than 100 films are made in our country each year, with an average of 20-25 films reaching our screens.
"And even they find it very difficult to compete with" Transformers "and" Iron Man, "which have huge budgets pumped into their promotion," the filmmaker said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals from various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries near and far abroad.

Kommersant-News - The new general contractor promises to deliver Zenit Arena by 26 December.
Metrostroy, the new general contractor of the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is to host matches for the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, promises to deliver the arena by 26 December, reports RIA Novosti, with reference to Vadim Tyulpanov, head of the temporary commission of the Federation Council on preparations for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
"Today, we visited the construction site together with the Minister of Sport of Russia, Vitaly Mutko, and the General Director of Metrostroy, Vadim Aleksandrov, was with us.
He said he would hand over the stadium by December 26.
It is a serious St. Petersburg company, it never breaks the deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were happy with what we saw and heard, "the agency quotes an interlocutor as saying.
Earlier, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competitions.
Mr. Tyulpanov also noted that the Commission of the Council of the Federal Federation headed by him will continue to monitor the progress of construction of the stadium and will regularly visit the construction site.
To recall, yesterday it became known that Metrostroy will complete the construction of Zenit Arena, the value of the contract will be about 5.4 billion roubles. The same company won a tender for the improvement of the area around the stadium, the value of the contract will be 2.4 billion roubles. Contracts with JSC Transstroy Corporation, LLC Engineering Corporation Transstroy-SPb and JSC Engineering Corporation Transstroy have been terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to compete for the construction of the stadium.
For more information about the choice of a new general contractor, read Kommersant's material: "Metrostroy was let into the field."
Konstantin Akulich, a lawyer for former Vice Governor Nikolai Sandakov, was detained in Miass (Chelyabinsk Region).
Another lawyer for the accused, Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural that Konstantin Akulich was summoned today to the Miass Investigative Committee's investigation department to face charges in a one-year-old battery case.
Then Konstantin Akulich went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially, it was initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he started defending Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulich," believes Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the ex-deputy governor's lawyer in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was summoned to the TFR Miass, the defense was notified that on Monday the deadline for familiarization with the case of fraud, which accuses Nikolai Sandakov, expires.
Recall that two criminal cases have been opened against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case), he is charged with promising to facilitate the appointment of Evgeny Tarasov, Head of the Administration of Ozersk, to the post of Mayor of Magnitogorsk, for 1.5 million roubles.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from Igor Kalugin, the director of the "Piton" private security company, in the form of illegal pro bono provision of services of a property nature in the amount of no less than 1.3 million roubles.
For more information about Mr. Sandakov's case, read Kommersant's "Former Vice Governor Demands Consolidation of His Cases."
Russian Copper Company (RMK) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has undertaken to modernize one of the country's oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises, the Karabash copper smelter.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by a British joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided for the life of the entire city.
In the 1990s, however, financial problems brought production to a halt, causing serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the operation of the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - the environmental one.
By the early 2000s, Karabash was already notorious as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmed began to change in 2004, after the enterprise was taken over by the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually began to reduce the ecological burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by Boris Dubrovsky, Governor of Chelyabinsk Region, who visited Karabashmed in early July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the changes that have occurred to the enterprise since Karabashmed became a part of the RMK group "monumental."
The main modernization effort of Karabashmed in recent years has been the construction of a new sulphuric acid plant, which allows for the capture of up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to Vsevolod Levin, President of the Russian Copper Company, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion roubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is reconstruction of converter processing.
The replacement of three converters, dusters, and a gas pipeline is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion roubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion roubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes allocated to the budget of the city of Karabash will also increase.
For the entire duration of the Tominsk Mining and Processing Plant project - from the start of construction until the commissioning of the second phase - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion roubles.
And after commissioning of the mining and processing plant, tax revenues to budgets at all levels could amount to 80.9 billion roubles.
346.3 million roubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels during the year of production in Varnensky District.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise successfully operates, the amount of contributions can be higher," Valery Ulanovsky added.
RMK clarified that in 2015, tax payments from Mikheevsky Mining and Processing Plant were close to RUB 1 billion.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of the areas where they operate is not limited to tax payments.
RMK's enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and recreational facilities, and improve the territory.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was the overhaul, and in fact, almost complete reconstruction, of kindergarten No. 9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
There will also be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops on the territory of RMK Arena.
RMK Arena will make it possible to hold spectacular professional sports events of an international level.
But the main objective of this project is to make physical education and sports activities in comfortable conditions available to Chelyabinsk residents, primarily children.

Staff at the Sandholm Refugee Centre in Denmark suspected that the teenagers living there were engaged in prostitution.

A pensioner has turned a swimming pool into a 'budget beach'
Online users mocked photos of an elderly man installing a pole on the beach and turning it into a diving board.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Taganrog" group on the VKontakte social network, which led many to believe that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, "innovation" was dubbed a "budget tower" and a "mobile springboard."
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "guts," while some pointed out that the man was at serious risk of injury when jumping from his tower because he had installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the Pikabu portal noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea from the image.
"First of all, we don't know how deep there is, the beach can be mound with a sharp descent by a meter just behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with the right skills you can jump from a couple of meters," wrote a user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ

A fine of 38 euros (about 42 dollars) has been imposed for wearing a burkini.
It is noted that the ban was introduced against the background of the terrorist attacks that took place on July 15 in Nice and on July 26 in a church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray in the north of the country.
Since its introduction, several Muslim women have appealed to the courts, claiming that the restrictions violate the right to freedom of religion.
The Blagoveshchensk City Court (Amur Region) sentenced the former head of the city, Alexander Migulya, to nine years in a penal colony.
This was reported on Friday, 12 August, on the court's website.
Migulya was found guilty of committing crimes under Articles 286 ("Excess of authority"), 285.1 ("Misappropriation of budgetary funds") and 285 ("Abuse of official powers") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official in December 2008 provided his acquaintance with a land plot in the village of Mukhinka in violation of the procedure established by land legislation.
In 2006, he illegally issued an order to acquire the city's ownership of a road bridge over the Chigiri River, at an inflated price, without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.
In addition, between 2007 and 2010, Migulya, in the interest of a commercial organization under his control, changed the timing of payments under the contract for the purchase and sale of land leases, which were granted for the construction of housing, as well as exempted the company from rent.
As a result, the regional budget lost more than 5 million roubles, and the city treasury lost about 21 million roubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who was in custody on suspicion of corruption and was claiming a parliamentary mandate, had failed to provide the election commission with the signature lists on time for participation in the State Duma elections and was withdrawn from the electoral race.
Migulya was arrested in May 2015 in Lipetsk region and placed in a pre-trial detention facility.

The bombings at resorts in Thailand are "acts of local sabotage" and have nothing to do with the activities of international terrorists.
This was reported by the Thai police, Reuters reports.
According to the police, they have not yet been able to establish whether the explosions are connected in any way.
According to the main version, their organizers tried to disrupt the tourist season.

Owners of messengers and mail services must identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the summary of a bill developed by the Media and Communications Union (MKS), which unites the largest Russian telecom operators (Vedomosti has a copy).
Employees of three member companies of the union confirmed that such a project is being discussed.
In early autumn, it should be presented to a working group headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, says a Vedomosti interlocutor in the ISS.
We are talking about amendments to the laws on communications and the media.
They stipulate that any "organizer of the dissemination of information on the Internet, which provides an opportunity to exchange electronic messages," is obliged to identify users on the basis of information contained in the databases of telecommunications service providers, having previously concluded contracts with them.

WSJ: The US is considering sanctions against Russia over the hacking of Democrats "servers.
US officials are considering imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
According to reports, in order to impose sanctions, US President Barack Obama's administration will have to officially blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on the servers.
According to sources, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies are almost certain of Russia's involvement in the cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the US generally prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
An exception is the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures "database, for which the DPRK was officially blamed.
Last year, however, Obama issued an executive order making it easier to impose sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyber attacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers were acting with Russian support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They will have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers broke into the servers of the National Committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks published emails from the Democratic National Committee.
Media outlets have reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may have been involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company argued that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited the pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced manufacturers of mobile devices to install other applications together with the Google Play store.
Following the results of the audit, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, Deputy Head of the FAS Alexei Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the ruling.
The FAS concluded that all companies, including multinational corporations, must comply with the competition law.
In turn, Google intends to first study the decision and only then decide on further action: to implement it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law back in September of last year and ordered that the contracts be amended by 18 December.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been engaged in litigation.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, it is discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion was expressed to Echo of Moscow by Eldar Murtazin, a leading analyst at Mobile Research Group.
Murtazin also noted that the fine would not affect either users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Caricature
Snapchat says the filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
With its "lens" tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million users a day to alter reality and play with individuality in ways that border on the absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The lenses are rough, feature-warping tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they have been accused of promoting dark facial skin or encouraging whitened faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics deemed it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow-faced."
And they wondered whether these recurring controversies point to the company's larger diversity problem.
On Wednesday, reports and outrage spread at The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The company commented: 'The lens was designed as a homage to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded them of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others rejected the anime comparison entirely.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said the lens was "offensive and embarrassing to say the least."
She added that "it's hard to argue with the comparison between a very crude caricature of Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowface, but highly derogatory yellowface.
Snapchat is not the only company crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the gadgets we all carry with us.
And Snapchat's huge audience of young people - who are more racially diverse than their elders - may mean that they are more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder to go unnoticed than it used to be."
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes racial tensions are the reason for Snapchat's lack of diversity in hiring.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended her post with the hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, herself a Chinese-American, wrote, "Either they didn't have enough non-white people on the staff to make these decisions, or they had non-white people working, but they didn't have positions where they could speak out safely and openly."
Other observers share her view, complaining that Snapchat has not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information on the representation of ethnic minorities in its staff, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origins of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and on actively trying to engage internal resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that it won't."
Military leaders misrepresented intelligence about ISIS, congressional panel says
Officials from the US Central Command altered intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events on the ground warranted, a congressional panel said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by a task force set up by the Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts, who said leaders were tweaking their assessments of American efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by Centcom's top command tended to present a more optimistic picture of US counterterrorism efforts than the actual evidence on the ground, and were consistently more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence agencies," the report said in a news release.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable: when a flawed analysis is presented to senior management, our military suffers," said Representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
Leadership problems at Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details persistent shortcomings in Central Command's description and analysis of US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the falsification of the reports, it claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and congressional testimony were significantly more optimistic than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at recapturing Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is known for sure," Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the most senior US Central Command intelligence officials manipulated command intelligence documents to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created the task force when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, released Thursday, will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, incomplete investigation of Centcom's intelligence is being conducted by the Department of Defense's inspector general.
Democratic representatives on the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which are consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively closed process for making intelligence assessments about ISIS and Iraqi security forces," Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's top Democrat, said in a statement.
That process, Schiff said, "stalled the release of intelligence documents," damaged analysts "morale, and" did not adequately reflect divergent views. "
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House tried to force Centcom analysts to tailor their conclusions to a "predetermined or political interpretation."
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were reported Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, opened after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Department would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics."
The implications of the investigation extend beyond the question of whether the US bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria (as a growing number of Defense Department officials now claim) is achieving its goal.
But last year's statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command to provide accurate assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis spots.
Criticism of the intelligence on the Islamic State echoes the controversy of more than a decade ago, when a Centcom intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research paper arguing that the administration of President George Walker Bush, over the objections of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq without thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest over intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes on Islamic State-owned refineries did not significantly worsen the terrorist group's financial position because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread beyond Central Command, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after Senate testimony that many lawmakers deemed overly optimistic about the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced in Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
US Wins 4th Straight in Women's Field Hockey, Moving Closer to Crucial Battle with Britain
Katie Bam, who once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 victory over Japan, opened the scoring Thursday with the first two goals for the United States women's field hockey team as the Americans defeated India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she is not sure if she would ever have done something like that.
"I won't use my mind," she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here's what she knows: The Americans are 4-0 up in the Olympic tournament and are vying for top spot in their group with Britain, which remains unbeaten after losing 2-0 to Japan on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarter-finals and the result will determine who finishes first in their six-team group and who finishes second.
The winner will avoid facing a strong Dutch team, the leaders of the other group, with a bit of weather when the quarter-finals begin.
But Saturday's game shows that the Americans have made a mess of it here, four years after finishing last among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a field hockey stick when she was 3 (her twin older sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest-ever player.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final.
Then came 2012, when things didn't go well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a psychological change, a change in physical fitness," Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the performance we have now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a free-kick from close range.
India came into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until late in the third period, when Bam took the lead.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sent the ball abruptly into the goal, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal midway through the fourth period.
The win was the first of the tournament for United States goalie Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in shock.
Like Bam.
"We're in a good position right now," Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Amid the Fury of the Olympics, the Zen of Trampoline
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, it is the Olympics.
Events in Rio de Janeiro seem immutable and inevitable, a frantic mix of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic torch itself, it is that burning torch that is passed from archer to swimmer, gymnast to triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors talk in turns in cafes and not hear about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
Then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian with puffy cheeks, might well have been among the prime-time celebrities promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials if he had been a swimmer, a gymnast, or even a fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline competition.
The Olympic torch does not cover all events in the same way.
Further from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal predilection, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years it has received so little recognition that many people I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
It can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to compete, it never won a medal in trampoline, and its athletes did not make the finals until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians tend to share the men's award, while the Chinese and Canadians share the women's award.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline has the charm of an outsider, not least because, for the unenlightened ear, it is more associated with a circus college than the Olympics.
Here I must confess that I am not an expert, but just a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have comic potential - the caricature of endless jumps - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín," meaning "diving jump."
The hopefuls jump on a giant trampoline, soaring almost 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and somersaults) before finally landing on their feet.
They are judged on performance, difficulty and "flight time," according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
Medal hopefuls need to go further, faster, higher and higher in their pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They aim not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the television cameras, for another teasing milestone: a world or Olympic record.
This persistence is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and enough to bring even the viewer to tears.
But it is also, in my opinion, a little tiresome when watching the Games.
From it, trampoline jumping provides a respite.
The direction of the trampoline is upward.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces, seemingly weightless, like an astronaut, flying up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And, of course, they are not without competition or difficulty, but throughout the program there is no frantic zeal for the finish, no long jump, only a wondrous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest to Zen Olympic sport.
The women's qualifying and then the final will take place on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1pm Eastern European time; the men's on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will air the finale as part of an afternoon program starting at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, there is a quiet, beautiful moment to be seen in the public dumps.
And if consciousness-raising can be achieved only by subjecting male athletes to lust-inducing looks and objectification - as the United States men's gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal - Dooley is just waiting for her new adoring crowd of fans.
"A generation is protesting" in Ethiopia, a long-time US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters have been fatally wounded in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of secession?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a firm ally of the West with rapidly growing economies.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to more and more of its territory.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand radical political change.
Human rights advocates say the government's response has been brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos from the protest sites, believed to have been shot late last year or earlier this year, show security officers beating young people with sticks as they were placed with their hands against a wall.
The top United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It's always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it's going to be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
America's military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably - there is even a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And its streets are typically quiet, safe, and clean.
But Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy - human rights organizations routinely cite government repression - and opposition within the state was stifled by effectively silencing dissidents.
Many have been exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be a rebellion," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
Complaints range from land use to the government coalition's power grab.
After a widely criticized election last year, the government party and its allies completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; fighting over that uncertain, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have been simmering for years are flaring up now.
The first, seemingly harmless: smartphones.
In the last couple of years alone, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social media, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and Internet service has improved.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find it possible to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized themselves to protest.
Second, there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups.
The Oromos and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We will work together under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 per cent of the population and controls the military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using intelligence to gather data and neutralize opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense," said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, emerged from nowhere to take Meles's place.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that this will lead to more bloodshed as a result.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands protested against what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government rigged and then rigged.
In the ensuing crackdown, many protesters were killed, though in smaller numbers than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for forward-looking infrastructure development, such as a new long-distance train, and significant progress in poverty reduction.
But this has clearly not stopped the rise of internal discontent with Ethiopia's government.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by Tigray, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming all-pervasive.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in an awkward position.
The US government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently announced that it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
"It's going to be hard to walk that tightrope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to play down the latest controversy engulfing his campaign on Friday, claiming he was joking when he claimed several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who had tried to protect him during a period of unrest, in an awkward position, having to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
After making the suggestion at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump insisted strongly on his claim on Thursday, repeating in interviews that he did mean to say that the president and Clinton had founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post in the early hours of Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just being caustic.
The post was the exact opposite of an assertion made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not seize the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted as Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid declining ratings.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to the topic.
Taking to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse in the past.
In late July, after drawing widespread criticism by suggesting that the Russians should hack Clinton's emails, he later clarified his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm kidding."
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in a political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that resonate with his fans, seeing how they work, and then" explaining "them one way or the other depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is careful about what he says and knows that it is vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening his language for the broader electorate, Trump has taken an even more acrimonious tone in recent days as his approval ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by large margins in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and trailing her in Florida.
While Trump tends not to apologize for provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has come under intense scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have embarrassed his loyal allies, who have had to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York who is one of Trump's best-known surrogates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is an acceptable political comment," Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it a no-threat, totally unfair organization, and that is why it happened, because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most average Republicans believe that the Obama administration, under which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to develop because it failed to deal firmly with the Middle East.
Before Friday's rally in Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the media for blurring his every word and being biased against him.
He scoffed at the "poor hapless" TV pundits trying to figure him out and said: "They're weak!"
Some Democrats scoffed at Trump's excuses as further evidence that he is unfit to be president.
Once-Displaced Cafe Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby, cash-only space in Williamsburg that had no Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her Bedford Avenue showroom.
The Soup Cherie store, which took Verb's place in the summer of 2014, sells cupcake-shaped soap.
Locals mourned it as the latest loss in a rejuvenating city.
Artist Molly Crabble wrote on Twitter: 'New York is changing all the time, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is ruined and Verb is now a soap shop.'
But while New York City is constantly changing, it is also renewing itself.
The revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
And the coffee is still good.
At the head of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He joined Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When a client offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, left much to the imagination.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
Bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches are on the menu, and toppings of capers or fried onions are available.
There are brown rice dishes.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but now prepares freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"A lot of former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsburg," he said.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those customers.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and frequented Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After Verb closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verb," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, though that day she ordered blended tea instead of the usual ice coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He would come in before work and order invariably the same thing.
"At fifteen minutes eight, every day, like clockwork, I would come in and they would make my bagel with butter and all the fillings for me," he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but one day he'll change something with bacon, egg, or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he was not offended that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soup Cherie offered to make special soap for Verb, using cold coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we might accept their offer," Rodriguez said.
Regular residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also flocked to the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the window to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new location has other benefits.
The local juice outlet plans to bottle and sell cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the coffee shop will be annexed to an adjacent building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new Verb will include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened at its new location, Whitt said that when he walked in and ordered a cup of coffee, it felt like he was back home.
"I've wanted to smell it for a long time," he admitted.
Depression's Depressive Food in "Dense Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after ascending to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmand, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes such as foie gras and Meryland tortoise soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, prune pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering," Jane Ziegelman said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are food historians.
Coe's most recent book, "Chinese Ragu," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziegelman told the story of living in a rental apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book "97 Fruit Garden Street House."
Their new collaborative work, "A Dense Meal," to be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some culinary solidarity of their own, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple eatery in the Flatiron district that has been open since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with slices of olives, while Coe, 57, picked up turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When a reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple found it a good starting point for a discussion about Depression-era food.
"There was a lot of demand for the rolls," Ms. Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut roll, a liver roll, a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine eating as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe grinned.
"He must have had a stone in his stomach," he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Dense Meal" describes how the country coped with suddenly ceasing to be a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally challenging was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes like rolls and casseroles became staples; casseroles were "a great way to recycle leftovers," Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unappetising ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for years the mainstay of American food, has become a frugally distributed luxury.
People tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of the era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dinner table has not been a success," Coe said.
Ziegelman added, "It was very strange."
Peanut butter is completely unsuitable for baked onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
As never before, and never since, home economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - have managed the country's eating habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers," take up the challenge and transform burdened spaghetti with carrots into tasty dishes.
"A Dense Meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Tales of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat pies" attitude, are particularly piquant.
Publicly extolling the simple Iowa farm bill of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake had his wife, Eleanor, not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste at all, which led the White House to "eat not only the saddest food in Washington, but sometimes the most hideously cooked."
Many of the Depression-era culinary tricks were forgotten once the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman says, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that while writing the book, they gained a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - that she couldn't throw away food, for example.
"She had a serious fear of food neglect," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalls: "She was absolutely poisoning people."
There was one nasty incident with profiteers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe took out a dessert they had made at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called prune mousse," Ms. Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped the spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
In the voice of a confident budgeter, he told his wife, "A little chopped walnuts wouldn't hurt."
Arrest of defendants in Khovanskoye Cemetery mass brawl case extended until November 14
Presnensky court left the defendants in the case of the mass brawl at Khovanskoye Cemetery in custody until November 14, having granted the corresponding request of the investigation.
Fourteen people are accused in the case.
Recall that on May 14, a mass brawl involving several hundred immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus took place at Khovanskoye Cemetery, with the use of weapons, resulting in the death of three people.
The former head of the cemetery, Yuri Chabuev, and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization Healthy Nation, Alexander Bocharnikov, have been charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions in 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on 12 August by Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets during a visit to Bryansk Oblast.
We have specific parameters for how much pension should be increased in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summarizing the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks, "Interfax quotes Golodets as saying.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Centre for Strategic Studies, Alexei Kudrin, to raise the retirement age by half a year each year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the cabinet was not considering this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan made it to the final of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan made it to the final of the small-caliber rifle shooting competition from a lying position at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second with 628.9 points.
In total, the top eight athletes made it to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen is demanding an international investigation into the circumstances surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt," the French newspaper Le Monde quotes Gülen as saying.
The Turkish opposition leader also stated that "if any part of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gülen strongly denies involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
An Istanbul court previously arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen in absentia.
Recall that the attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of 15 / 16 July.
Gilead to reimburse attorney fees in hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to recover attorney fees it incurred in a hepatitis C patent dispute with drug maker Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was cleared of paying $200 million in damages for violating two of Merck's patents related to Gilead's drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a US judge found a series of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
In a court filing Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to reimbursement for costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now sweeping the city after the departure of the remaining group of fighters who had been hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are undertaking clean-up operations," he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former secretary of state reported income of $3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton's would-be vice president, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind bogus excuses and reneging on his past promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited a Internal Revenue Service audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move," Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic nominee's declarations.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the reviews were complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, have said his refusal raises questions about his wealth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video highlighting prominent Republicans who urged Trump to release his tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during an economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades: release his tax returns," she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid little or no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become a contentious issue in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that people making more than $1 million a year pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, suggested that Trump meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he, too, is under IRS scrutiny, and that Trump is "afraid" not of the tax agency, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign released tax returns through 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons "2015 returns showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from salaries.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Chili powder condoms and fireworks boost protection of Tanzania's elephants
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to stop elephants from wandering into human settlements - throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the US Committee for the Conservation of Nature, took it upon themselves to promote it by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to defend themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we invented the toolkit... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants," Honeyguide executive director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps consist of lighting the torch in front of the trespassing elephant and sounding the horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
The chilli powder, mixed with soil, is placed with a flake in a condom, and its end is twisted, with only a wick left outside.
When lit, the condom bursts with a bang, spraying a fine dust of chilli powder in the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn an elephant in the other direction.
The last resort is a launcher that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Thirty-two Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July have yet to return to Turkey.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 career diplomats to continue their work at the center.
32 of them did not return without objective reasons and explanations, "the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
Recall that in July, a coup attempt took place in Turkey.
The country's authorities officially announced that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, including senior and mid-level military officials.
According to the Turkish Foreign Ministry, 290 people were killed as a result of the coup attempt.
Jewish director slams Berlin hotel for deleting Israel's phone code at "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French director of Jewish origin sparked a media scandal when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel's phone number, with employees citing "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of Holocaust documentary "Shoah," expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states that can be reached directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the option of dialing Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue at the hotel reception.
The response he received there, Lanzmann said, "shocked him."
A hotel clerk said the move was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind the move has angered the director even more.
"Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel's code be removed," Lanzmann was quoted as saying by the hotel employee.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yaakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "terrible shame," Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were shocked and appalled by the incident.
It is, in fact, a terrible shame.
The fact that this happened in Germany, and in this particular hotel chain, is an even greater shame.
No explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions, "the official said.
The incident caused quite a stir online; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel was simply "following through" on the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," said another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, is next to a synagogue.
The hotel itself was quick to dismiss any accusations, calling the incident an "oversight" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel on the fast dial list," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski spokesman as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The disturbances began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which resulted in the use of rubber bullets and tear gas by police.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under the proposals of the Governor of the State of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public secondary schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets en masse to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country's Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran up 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest on the part of Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are reconnecting with Iran, and new firms are eager to gain market access.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that for the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons, "the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year's record number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was "systematic non-fulfillment" of the instructions of the CEO of Almaz-Antey Concern, "omissions in work" and "loss of trust."
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about Neskorodov's dismissal appeared only on Thursday evening and did not elicit a wide response in the media.
What explains this silence in the face of massive rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public sphere.
This confirms once again that the military-industrial complex (MIC) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from the public.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
NPO Almaz is the parent company of the concern, which specializes in the production of sea and land-based surface-to-air missile systems (SAM).
Currently, Almaz is working on the development of the Polyment-Redut and Morpheus anti-aircraft missile systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia, Dmitry Kornev, believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was caused by the failure to meet the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morpheus began back in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
Polyment-Redut is to become the main air defense system on the Navy's newest ships.
According to the information I receive, in the course of several years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been carried out.
The truth, as far as I can judge, is not Almaz's unequivocal fault, "Kornev said.
The expert fears that a delay in commissioning could also occur with the S-500 anti-aircraft missile system.
Development work on the project has not yet been completed, but in the course of 2016, the first systems are due to enter the military.
The Ministry of Defense asserts that "the work is being carried out as planned and everything will be completed in a timely manner," although in 2014 the Ministry acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been in charge of Almaz since 2011.
Kornev stated that delays in project deadlines can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the military-industrial complex and the plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of roubles, and big money, as is well known, loves silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies resign of their own volition, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal took place in public, although it did not resonate.
This suggests that the head of Almaz may have been a shy figure, resisting "orders" coming down from above.
It seems that the state will no longer tolerate such behavior.
With shareholders "hands, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defence's policies and do not fulfill their tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish managers who have been abducted (fraud at the Zvezda shipyard).
Increased attention to the problems of the sector is paid personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of military-industrial complex managers by seeking to have at hand a loyal staff of directors who will carry out orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but given rampant corruption and the absence of normal competition in the military-industrial complex, the state has no other tools.
The current situation in the defense sector is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "purge" of managers in the military-industrial complex, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu to the post of Minister of Defence.
The president seems to have adopted the famous saying, "If you want peace, prepare for war."
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military might and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's spheres of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the "victors" in the Cold War eventually led to the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, perhaps there is no safe haven left in the "civilized world."
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia as an equal partner.
Under such conditions, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will enable Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scotland's Callum Skinner races to the finish line as Brits grab cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio last night as the Team GB trio defended their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the strongest role his fellow Scot Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the youngster proudly made history by racing down the finish line to snatch victory from the New Zealand favourite.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing a lowly sixth at the Track Cycling World Championships in London in March, despite Hoy having since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was replacing specialist batsman Jamie Staff.
They did so just as Hindes appeared.
Hoy's departure has also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton have tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held in high regard by British coaches when they saw the potential in the Scot, which has now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner backed up.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and Skinner in particular to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his seat as a BBC pundit and caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped on to the podium.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing at London 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted deliberately falling on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain's competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said: "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the podium."
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost in so many world-famous races that to win the Olympics again was just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome will have another five successful days.
With the form Kenny has shown, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
That would see Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date in British sport that is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - take his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny will next compete in the sprint, which starts today and runs over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: 'I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your mates.
It's a bit lonely to win on your own, to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified fastest in the four-man, four-kilometre team pursuit.
They finished in 3: 51.943.
The world record set when he won gold at London 2012 is 3: 51.659.
The first round and final (10.42pm) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will surely be the focus.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the corresponding women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie improved the world record by clocking 4: 13.260.
Team GB have come to rely on a mighty cycling team to take ownership of the middle period of the Olympics and earn a heap of medals.
After truly exceptional displays of total dominance in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered in the gradual build-up to Rio.
There have been dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and bullying, and the resignations of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first night's race in the velodrome, it seems that Britain's now legendary glory in reaching the summit at the right time may just be repeating itself.
Portland smelter's future in jeopardy over power contract termination
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is in jeopardy as the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, prepares to terminate the supply contract, with all supply contracts expected to be terminated.
The move follows the Victorian government's decision earlier this year not to renew subsidies to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the smelter consumes about 10 per cent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
Alcoa closed its Point Henry smelter in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland smelter is losing money and risks closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, initially because of the strong Australian dollar and later because of the price of the plant's output.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminium plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The plant is controlled by a short-term joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will not stop," it said.
AGL said the contracts were so-called "hedged contracts," which were due to take effect in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will effectively end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to deliver their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017," the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings from FY2018 onwards is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the value of the contracts in its accounts by $187 million in light of the "impending termination."
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the smelter or provide electricity to the smelter."
The US company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to take effect this November, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts had feared the closure of both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle because of the industry's poor economic performance.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL operations chief Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It will be bad for us as a manufacturer, "he said.
Not just the Kardashian reality star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris's Kardashian-Jenner clan, has appeared on the coveted September cover of US Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has walked at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"Being in a room with my favorite people, I looked at that cover and cried," Kendall wrote.
The cover news was accompanied by a bizarre (or just "Kardashian Family" -like?) reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (spoilers Rob and Caitlyn, also joined by everyone's favorite showbiz uncle, "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about their sister's appearance on the cover, and at the end a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
It's a standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's birthday television shows (Seacrest utters the phrase, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of an 8am cartoon rabbit), but Kris needed that fame to go to other girls one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the magazine's September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a thickness that looks more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashionista estimates that 615 pages of last year's 832-page issue contained advertisements).
News of which stars will appear on its cover is so eagerly anticipated that in the past two years, the magazine's photos have been fused together before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who work as models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities."
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was honored with the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, described by the magazine as the "pre-eminent model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality TV stars, or modern kids who know how to make good videos on Snapchat (though Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on last year's cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of her album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world was always going to be precarious, given her past as a reality TV star.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid as the "bitches of the moment."
That sentiment has boiled over again following the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there is no point in fixating on discontent.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's a debutante for Marc Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all of her sisters, sell their photos to you on their own paid-for apps.
She's selling handmade photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Kourtney and her children, she takes part in reality TV shows.
Community legal centres deny services to 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable are denied services at community legal centres, as the sector braces for an impact that will further cut funding for already stretched activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people unable to fight unfair dispossession, and so on - have already been turned away while seeking free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, already stretched beyond capacity, are bracing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal centers are set to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
Director of Community Legal Centres Queensland James Farrell said the latest census report from the National Association of Community Legal Centres showed thousands of people were already being turned away each year.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's community legal centres are consistently underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied vital services they need," he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, workers who have been unfairly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 per cent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected Queenslanders will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We are calling on Justice Minister and Queensland Senator George Brandis to reverse these funding cuts immediately so people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government delivered on its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of community legal centres and communities, their clients, and it is time for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign sued after staffer allegedly threatened him with gun
Donald Trump's campaign is being sued in New York after it was reported that its North Carolina operations director threatened a staffer with a gun as they drove in a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized "it's not going to happen."
Director Earl Phillip "pulled out a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and pointed the barrel at Vincent's knee cup," Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to local and regional campaign headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people were involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the statement said.
"Guns do not need to fire to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused a furor by telling an audience in North Carolina that "Second Amendment people" - understood to be gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton is elected and can choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context, and that he did not advocate violence.
In his complaint, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent control, and from Phillip for threats of physical violence, physical abuse, and moral injury.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to speak to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, reported that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately returned.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump ran a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Superior Court Division, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte.
Britain must harness the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring regeneration and prosperity not just to our communities here and across London, but across the country.
Like me, this was Heathrow's great advantage, just as it was with London 2012, where we worked hard to ensure that our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics have done immense good for Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our communities here alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as there were before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would find ourselves in a quandary on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012 and will be proved wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked about it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the many, not just the few.
Expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211bn of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have an excellent team at Heathrow who have implemented an £11bn programme of infrastructure investment on time and on budget, from T5 - voted the airport's best terminal five years in a row - to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, backed by £16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for Britain, and I am confident that Heathrow expansion will be, too.
It is time for us to harness the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of Heathrow Council and former Treasury Trade Attaché
Adblock Plus, Facebook play cat-and-mouse game over ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to circumvent ad-blocking software is a "cat-and-mouse game," according to one of the companies that makes the software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now says it was able to get around the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source ad blocking community and those who try to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking," and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fray is a clear sign of just how big an issue ad blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, some 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe; almost four times as many used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for desktop ad blockers because mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to a spokesman.
Still, desktop advertising is a lucrative enough item that Facebook considers such a move a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook said Adblock's new filters are worrisome because they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people and we plan to address this issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to put control in people's hands.
Woman run over on Swiss motorway in apparent suicide
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
Police are appealing for witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a motorway in the early hours of Thursday in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent attempt to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died at the scene.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, said police, who are appealing for them and anyone else who witnessed the incident to come forward.
A criminal case has been opened, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen, however, whether any of the drivers involved will face charges.
Was it possible to avoid hitting?
That's what the prosecutor has to determine, "Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers will not be held responsible.
In each case - both involving a man walking in the dark on a motorway - a ruling was made that motorists could not expect to encounter a pedestrian on the motorway accidentally in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was cleared of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on a night out in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and fainted on the road, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman - who was responding to an emergency call - was driving in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was a "completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-dioxide-saturated atmosphere, could ever have had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation rate is due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulations suggest that Venus may have had a rarefied Earth-like atmosphere and still rotated slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry regions than Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to support life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus substitutes its daytime side of the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella to protect the planet's surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is an average climate temperature that, surprisingly, is a few degrees cooler than today's Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by planetary scientists.
Although Venus may once have been habitable, it has been exposed for several billion years to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, all that remained was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a lethal greenhouse effect - that is, Venus as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy quits as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president / general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and said the club would begin its search for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions affecting the team's performance.
These conditions have not been met so far.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was routed by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs the last two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and are five points behind the Wild for the second Western Conference wild-card spot.
A Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two each with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks and suspend strike
Workers "strikes over North Sea oil workers" wages have been suspended and all sides in the dispute are embarking on a new round of talks, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the current dispute," a joint statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, beginning early next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was against potential pay cuts of up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 per cent because of negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 per cent reduction in rates for onshore contract workers in 2014.
The company said the additional cuts would give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations in the wake of its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, with the economic situation worsened by the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest North Sea labor disputes of our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few," he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotation rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
The latest mission by the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the spin rates of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster spin at different speeds, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"By comparing our results with other star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Louise Rebull, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology, said in a press release.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They are spinning as fast as ever.
At their peak spin speeds, these maturing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
By traveling through the stars "magnetic fields, these winds have a retarding effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its spin rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the spin rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots - such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of spin rates suggests that more massive stars spin more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull likens the stars to dancers: the larger ones make pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that those that spin slowly tend to be more massive, whereas those that spin faster tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with their rotation speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, where, and why stars slow down their rotation and hang up their "dance shoes," figuratively speaking.
Rebull and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the spin rates of the Pleiades in three new papers soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are conducting an investigation into the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, Kommersant writes.
The FSB collects evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
As previously reported, a confession was made by a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armensk, the oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields as objects for sabotage.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all of the saboteurs "accomplices have been apprehended.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev District Court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov becomes head coach of the Russian national football team
At a meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will last for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On 11 August, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played in the position of goalkeeper at Spartak Moscow, as well as a coach with solid experience who was a mentor to such Russian teams as Spartak, Zhemchuzhina-Sochi, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and also to Warsaw's Legia, which won the national championship and the national cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it falls to him to prepare the team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that Miroslav Romaschenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov will join his coaching staff.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will amount to 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the RFS leadership has set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of bringing the Russian team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
According to the coach himself, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team as a priority and intends to give the players an opportunity to prove themselves.
According to Cherchesov, he is also glad that the choice was made for him.
The first match under Cherchesov's leadership will be held by the Russian team on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Recall that Leonid Slutsky previously held the post of head coach of the Russian national football team, combining it with coaching at the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
In doing so, he took responsibility for the team's poor performance on his own.
Sandwiched between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered mightily during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, the country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is the government's emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries take for granted free primary and secondary education, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to "recover costs."
In Namibia, however, primary education is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini coefficient, the standard measure of income inequality, has fallen by 15 points.
Back then, 23 years ago, that figure was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (on less than $1.90 a day) has also declined, from almost 53% to less than 23%.
Namibia also has the highest free-speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country is well ahead of the United States and other rich nations.
Moreover, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the Corruption Perceptions Index, which is compiled by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia has managed to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than one-third of the level of debt in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia also has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional estimations, is still quite high, at almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV / AIDS - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is an upper-middle-income country, but the authorities insist that the country is in fact a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
Isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes live in the deserts of the country and must somehow be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter-century ago is no easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the consequences of climate change.
Namibia has not given up, however, and is addressing the challenges it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities set about creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Remarkably, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides low-cost health care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
Approximately 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibians understood that neighbors were not chosen, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment, and exchanging students.
Moreover, Namibia's government has rightly recognized that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, enriching the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia's natural resources need to be invested in infrastructure and productive capacity.
They also recognize that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of the country's resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to ensure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hage Geingob, has noted, the media often say things that he does not like.
But after the struggle for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must protect its liberties, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are finite.
Some - such as fishing - are renewable, and the government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even countries that begin with serious flaws - racism, colonialism, inequality, and underdevelopment - can embark on the path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard about the "Gold of Varna," the oldest gold objects created by man (4600-4200 BC).
It was probably the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavation of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artefacts - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms - were found.
In one grave alone, known as Grave No. 43, 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg were recovered.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be transferred to the pristine-looking beads found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsite in the Pazardzhik district.
The beads are a gold band wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, the head of excavations at Tell Yunatsite, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, let us recall, date from about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
Technologies to date metal with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
Where is the certainty about which gold is more ancient?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that Yunatsite's gold is older than Varna's."
This is an extremely important find: it looks tiny, but it is big enough to take its rightful place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the beads as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsite is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today Tell Yunatsite is considered to be the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metal processing flourished in the region, from mastering the first metallurgical skills to creating a full-fledged industry.
In Russian historiography, there is a special name for this archaeological community: the Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around metal processing centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Tell Yunatsite is probably the oldest of these, as artefacts dating back to 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Yunatsite a prototype of a modern city, even though it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Schumer," Boyadzhiev says, referring to the conventional wisdom that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern Iraq.
It was there that the first cities in the familiar sense of the word arose.
Excavations of Tell Yunatsite have been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about one-third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall, which once reached three metres in height, have been found.
Little remains of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists can clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, dense urban buildings, a "business center" and residential suburbs.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay bird figurines have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of calm, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The "Bird City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but horses and weapons.
The three-metre-high fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists found obvious signs of a brutal massacre: the remains of elderly people, women and children were found inside the houses with marks of wounds inflicted by axes.
New discoveries and new facts emerge every year, changing the conventional wisdom about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
A powerful impetus in the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna," found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna's golden luxury should have been preceded by something - something like the tiny gold beads created in Tell Yunatsite.
Porsche artificially aged the 911 Targa
It has been officially announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being prepared manually by specialists from the division that works with production machines.
"Retro-bow," for example, consists in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received the trademark white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch wheels RS Spyder, as well as some body details painted in "white and gold metal."
In the interior, retro features are noticeably less: it features, in the main, a grey-blue design range, new seats with extended range of electric adjustments, and black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the division.
In addition, when purchasing a special version, each buyer will receive as a gift a car cover and a richly decorated album with photographs of the production process.
Porsche Exclusive specialists did not touch the power unit: the retro-targa's characteristics quite coincide with the serial one.
It is equipped with a 3.0-litre turbocharged six-cylinder engine producing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited edition, but neither its volume nor the price of each specific sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an "arms race"
Facebook's recent introduction of technology to prevent ads from being hidden on the social network's pages has prompted ad-blocking software developers to retaliate.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote," but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus touted its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, in an effort to deceive the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, together with commercial ads, blocks many of the usual posts from friends or pages.
Facebook said it regretted AdBlock Plus's policy and promised to fix the problem soon.
As a source among the developers of the social network told the publication TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook, will be ready in the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race," trying to beat each other, while the injured party was users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated recently.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear in court · Vecherniy Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for Murmansk Region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is very serious - sexual assault.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused committed acts of a sexual nature using violence against a 20-year-old girl in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk. The criminal case with an approved indictment was sent for consideration on the merits.
The penalty for this article is a maximum penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring the Fengguang 370 crossvan and Rich New pickup truck to Russia - www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of a growing class of cars in China that combines the virtues of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup truck.
Many Western companies decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so Chinese firms will fill the void in the exhibition halls of Crocus Expo.
In particular, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has large views of the Russian market and intends to offer our car enthusiasts a number of interesting new products in the near future, will be a powerful front.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossvan, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55,900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand rubles at the current exchange rate).
Such a price tag hardly shines for Russians, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans following the results of June sales, although, due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and the protective plastic cover along the lower perimeter of the body, it could well be classified as a crossover.
The crossvan is built on the front-wheel-drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2,725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4,565 mm vs. 4,510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The interior is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla's" on the central console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossover, and the simpler cars with "music" went on sale.
Five of the seven seats fold down easily to form a flat loading area with a length of 1,650 mm and a maximum trunk capacity of 1,500 l.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is just one - a 1.5-litre petrol "atmospheric" 115 hp, docked to a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises an appetite for sparing the budget of the owner of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New pickup truck is well known to Russians as the Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a design slightly ennobled by Chinese stylists.
Despite its obsolete design, this model is still in steady demand with the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse."
At a similar price, the Rich New will certainly appeal to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two optional engines: gasoline 2.4 l (137 hp) or turbodiesel 2.5 l (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are also modifications with a rigidly connected "front."
The new flagship A9 sedan will also be at the Dongfeng booth, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative of the Chinese firm back in June.
The number of minivan-like crossovers in the Chinese market is increasing, with the Cowin V3 and SWM X7 among the latest innovations.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the first seven months of this year, the Chinese firm's dealers sold 696 vehicles in our country.
Transport tax notices will no longer be sent by mail - website Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending property tax notices.
All Russian car owners are used to this pattern, which has not changed in years: in the summer and autumn, they receive by mail receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate has quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspectorate automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will continue to receive the usual letters.
However, there is also an opportunity for account holders to return to the old scheme on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit a tax office during August and write an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal account" as soon as it is drawn up, while the letter will last a few days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has passed 18 million people, which will allow the agency to save significantly on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspectorate's website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed procedure.
Some may have registered in a "personal account" for a one-time service and long ago forgot about it.
These people will not wait for notification by mail and, unbeknownst to them, will fall into the category of defaulters, with all the consequences that entails.
Access to the "Personal Taxpayer Account" is provided in three ways: through an account on the gosuslugi.ru portal, with the help of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
Notification began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, in which modifications are aimed at achieving very high returns, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who undertook to modify the sports car Mercedes-AMG G G 63.
G-Power is known for its passion for BMW cars, but nothing human is alien to its craftsmen.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - a 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helik," the masters took advantage of the advantages offered by the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight."
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by an indiscernible 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of leapfrogging in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are certainly giving him a noticeably better performance.
The speed limit is frightening: if the standard G 63 does not travel faster than 210 km / h, a tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic "collar" is capable of squeezing 250 km / h.
From the outside, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory source, with the exception of the other wheel discs - the 23-inch Hurricane RR 305 / 35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking 6 m long concept coupe that will be unveiled as part of the Elegance Competition at Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
In the coming years, at least four eco-friendly innovations are expected to appear.
