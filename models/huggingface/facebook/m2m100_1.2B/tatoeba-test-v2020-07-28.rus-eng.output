She gives him whatever he asks.
Is it sold?
I am getting more angry.
Do you have so much more?
It is legal.
Do you like your name?
We cannot afford to buy a new car.
This only aggravates the problem.

His house on the hill.
It was Sunday and I didn’t get up early.
How many lunches!
Are you in good shape now?
I corrected the error.
Do you want me to call them?
Tom made 20 pushes.

Why are everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I am not afraid of him.
I am very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.

It sounds simple.
I cannot afford to buy it.
I’ve never seen you in a hat.
Put it on the regiment.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a huge number of vehicles on this road.
You deceived us all.
I don’t think Tom has brothers or sisters.
He must love you.
It makes no sense to pretend that you make me believe that I believe what you don’t believe.
I think that would be a big mistake.

I am loved.
You don’t seem to be very busy.
Deadline has passed.
You are very similar to me.

I discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, living among the people, spoke in the horrible, from the Jewish point of view, Galilean dialect of the Aramaic language instead of Hebrew, thus showing the unconfirmation of the claims of the existence of any sacred language, the use of which in prayers brings closer to God.
Eventually, Tom changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don’t want to go.
Tom paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don’t know all the facts.
I know what Tom will do.
The weather forecast is not wrong.
Tom obviously doesn’t know anyone.
I’ll ask Tom to prepare something for you to eat.
I will find Tom.
I have no more books.
I want you to read this book.
He did not wear a tie.
This is my answer!
I heard him singing in the shower.
You remind me of a young man.

Is this my book?
Washing is a routine work.
Who else is on your list?

I think you need to talk to them.
He studied physics at Oxford.
He hid this fact from me.
Did you save me?

Someone said something, but I didn’t understand it.
Someone has to talk to him.
I never worried about them.
He was able to get to the hospital on his own.

I think this medicine will be of great benefit to you.
Tell Tom to be here by half the third.
It is not God who knows what science is.
Tom suspected that Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won’t tell her.
Maybe you shouldn’t talk to her.

Want to drink beer?

He was not polite to Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car is selling well.
I have to work this weekend.
You cannot do this to us.
His words confused me.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I knew what Tom had to do.
Send her a greeting from me.
Was it a lie?
Tom’s response shocked everyone.
Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in response?
It is time for me to go.
Where was your son?
I saw it in the store.
The world is cruel.
I have a sensitive dream.
He has nothing to do with anyone but himself.
I am from Suzuka.
Tom cut down all the trees in his backyard.
Saturday is a free day.
I wonder what happened to her.
The last bus leaves in 30 minutes.
He told me that he would do it.
He gave him a book.
Thank you very much for staying with me.
She gave me nothing.
I eat understandably.
He wrote to his parents.
I am happy with what is.
Why have you just come?
The postman Mil.
I want to know if Tom and Mary are eating meat.

Hawaii is my favorite pizza.
He was a hockey fan.
Who was here first?
Are you singing in the choir?
Were you home last night?

It was not accidental.
Do not blame yourself.
What do you want to talk about?
Tom screams at Mary.
This is my favorite song.
Do not leave the engine on.
I don’t know what’s in the box.
He said Mary was from Australia.
Does she know you?
Tom was arrested in October 2013.
You are very insightful.
Again and again in our lives there are obstacles, some call them problems, others talk about opportunities for growth.
Thank you for taking him fishing.
You will not have that problem.
I prefer to spend time with friends.
Find a solution.
I hear a dog lying in the woods.
He said he wanted to leave the company.
Do you want to enter?

Let us go?
I knew I could rely on you!
Tom put the wood on the fire.
“Love never killed anyone.” – “Ask Romeo and Juliet.”
What said the boy?
I bought everything I planned.
It looks like a virus.
Let me give you my phone number.
I could not let her go.
Tom died a year and a half ago.
I knew you would come back.
These books are old.
Are we already leaving?
Neither Tom nor Mary had ever been to Boston.
Have you ever sought?
If I had money, I would buy a computer.
Tom is smiling?
She went to Paris.
Tom is in school, right?
Please let us know.
Tom nodded and went to the door.
It was just a joke.
Try to prove that I am wrong.
I told you to stay in your room.
Do you have pain somewhere?
He could not go because of a lack of money.
Let me explain how it works.
Open the door or we’ll break it!
Tom thought that Mary probably’t give up French.

I’ll think of you every day until I’m gone.
It was a bad bet.
The thought that she was going alone bothered me.
The river flows measurably.
He looks like Johnny Depp.
I watched them.
Do you really love her?
He stated the facts without comment.
It was dark green.
He will surely come.
Is there a message?
Tom suddenly called me.
We really need it.
I called him, but the line was busy.
Tom will answer all your questions.
I will bring glasses.
I decided to surrender.
The accident took away their only son.
Everyone knows there is something new in this old capital.
I am always careful.
I went to the market.
Do you bring a towel?
Tell him that I have his keys.
I don’t think Tom knows Mary’s phone number.
Do we have a chance to win?
I knew I had to stay home.
He understands French.
Tom was sitting on a bus heading to Boston.
Falling, she broke her elbow.
I am sick.
We’ll talk to Tom later.
Do you want to be rich?
You are called.

She doesn’t like my way of speaking.
Mary wants another child.
I don’t care what you do with your money.
I would like to see the boss.
He did not travel to Boston by car.
Weather forecasts cannot be relied upon.

This car looks angry.
Are you studying English?
Are you my enemy?
She asked him for some money for a new dress.

I have an assignment for Tom.
“How did the accident happen?” – “No one knows.”
What do you like about him?
When I got to the station, I called my friend.
I need to buy a plane ticket to Moscow.
We met last week.
Do not believe anything he says.
He freed himself from his foreign accent.

I have an offer for you.
Did she like dinner?
I think Tom was crying.
Tom and I are planning to get married on October 20.
If you want to be alone, I will leave.
He has many talents.
He is in a bad mood.
How would you like to be called?

I was in a hurry.
He said he did nothing illegal.
Tom said he was exhausted.
He studied until late at night.
Tom’s room is very small.
Do you speak Italian?
The girl smiled to me.
This song is doomed to success.
I will surprise you.
We showed them that we can.
I am proud of them.
I just got home.
Tom burns both wood and coal in his oven.
My eyes hurt.
I love stories.
We must be prepared.
What were his first words?
I’ll take them with me, okay?
Tom gave Mary his keys.
I talk to him all the time.
I can’t help laughing at her jokes.
Through the prophet Zacharias, God predicted the unification in Jesus Christ of royal authority and priesthood.
Do you want me to talk to Tom?
Each of us went home.
The thread is thin, but strong and does not break.
This is all a little stupid.
At the moment I do not know what I want.
It is incredible.
I think you sent me the wrong order.
Six or five in favor of viewers.
I think she is a good dancer.
Tom is interested in biology.
She tried to kill him.
Was he really so bad?
Please tell me where you will live.
They all need attention.
I am myself.
He did not want to talk about it anymore.
He looks amazing.
Tom will help you if you ask him.
I hope no one has seen you come here.
This is Tom’s voice.
Can we bring Tom?
Tom said I was ugly.
Do you cry often?
We did not expect such results.
I have already read it.
If the car is broken, we will walk.
Can I touch your hair?
Found something interesting?
Everyone does it.

It’s one of the ugliest buildings I’ve ever seen.
The robber broke into the post office in the middle of the day.
That’s why I left.
Why did you buy a French car?
Tom wants to come too.
With God’s help...
I do not like coffee too much.
The table is old.
We are both very busy.
The darkness is invisible.
I get everything I want.
Are you happy to meet me?
I will ride after you.
He tried to drown in the bathroom.
Tom and I grow together.
I said goodbye.
Tom is Mary’s younger brother.
You behave like a fool.
Tom loves to play cards.
The book is big.
Don’t say that about Tom.
I seem to have expressed myself clearly.
We have been waiting for three hours.
It is important that you understand.
Times may change, but human nature remains the same.
Tom looks very upset.
I brought cookies.
Tom will teach French next year.
I listened to her until the end.
I advised Tom to rest.
Why is it angry you?
The worst part of the trip is already behind.
We will miss you both.
Do not be so shy!
I heard this phrase on the street about an hour ago.
He kissed her in the shoulder.
Do you not speak French?
How dare you do that!
This knife was very useful to me.
How do you know what I had?
It will take you only a minute.
I would very much like to change this situation.
We took care of everything.
I was very fat before.
They will not return.
You should not trust any of them.
Sometimes I feel like a wheel in a wheel.
He never experienced that.
Do you want to go with us?
Can Tom swim?
Just tell them what you need.
We plan to leave as soon as possible.
He went skiing on Hokkaido.
“Take your crazy music and read the book.” – “I see, my censoring spell still works!”
You knew her better than me.
I’ve discussed this with Tom.
I sent you the money you asked for.
There is no salvation for her.
Sorry I did this without you.
You have blood from your nose.
Mary kissed you, right?
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
You will soon be rewarded for your efforts.
Tom wants the same thing as you.
We cannot just ignore it.
Where did you meet Tom?
Where is the supermarket nearby?
You have to trust me.
He did not recognize Mary.
I don’t think I like that.
Even if you are fake, join us.
Tom wanted to apologize to Mary again.
Tom was thoughtful.
You are too young to go there alone.
Unlike my brother, I do not know how to swim.
He never was.
I really would like to go with you, but I can’t.
There has never been such.
I did not intend to do that.
I cannot believe you.
I bought bread.
Get quick or you will be late to school.
Have you ever written a book?
Tom is not leaving.
Tom and Mary changed places.
How do they endure you?
Where are you going to live?
I’m usually a peaceful person, but it’s hard to imagine what I’m capable of when my family is in danger.
Mary made Alice a new dress.
This decision was difficult to take.
I thought you wanted to drink.
I got what you asked for.
He said he would do it.
Tom didn’t have to leave.
Mary recovered from illness.
I did not know where you were.
Where did Tom get it?
Eating meat is harmful to your health and the environment.
Do you tell me you know nothing about it?
What are your plans, Tom?
Tom is not able to enjoy life.
I want you to ask for me a word.
No one loves me.
I don’t know Tom’s phone.
“Yes, did you tell him?” – “No, he knew it himself.”
Your explanation was very understandable.
I slept the rest of the day.
I understand French.
I’m sure you just thought about something.
Sugar is the world’s largest source of dust.
What do you like the most in Boston?
I want to be alone.
They were waiting for the signal to start.
I told them not to tell anyone.
We have a lot to buy.
I read an interesting book yesterday.
Tom will pay.
You don’t need to know why.
My favorite tree is the crying iva.
I do not have this book.
I see no difference.
What are you studying?
You are hopeless.
The sun is in the center of the solar system.
Are you a policeman?
Tom deceived both me and Mary.
You shouldn’t have said what you said.
He will come back in a few days.
I cut my shave.
Tom and Mary seem to be more than just friends.
The river irrigated the garden.
A strong wind ceased at night.
The ants and giraffes are distant relatives.
Tom did it because I told him so.
I am not leaving.
Who taught you this?
You need him.
He carried two suitcases.
Tom didn’t seem to recognize me.
Someone is missing.
I will tell her myself.
When are you leaving?
Look not to slip.
The mountain is green.
I have my own theory.
I just had a conversation with your teacher.
I’m used to going to bed early.
Do you think I’t help you?
Tom in the office.
All Tom does is watch television.
Tom is in a good mood today.
This is the most delicious peanut of all I have eaten.
I had problems with parking.

He has never been late to school.
Why are you so stubborn?
Go ask your father.
Do you still want to go?
The teacher wrote a brief commentary on each sheet.
It is hard to take you seriously.
Members of this tribe settled along the river.
I will fix it.
I said let them go.
When to start?
No one cares about what she thinks.
It doesn’t seem strange at all.
“Where did you get my phone?” he said.
When will you clean the wheat?
Tom told Mary he was ready to do it.
Does it make sense to repair it?
Why do you lock the door?
He said he tried it three times.
He thinks I am in love with her.
The plane leaves at eight in the morning.
We can try.
Give it to her.
I want to live in Australia.
You can’t write programs.
Change the subject.
I like to travel around the world.
Tom understands it.
Tom is low, but strong.
It’s cold this morning, right?
It was a very romantic kiss.
She prepared dinner.
Please find Tom.
He will give it to you.
This proposal is unclearly written.
What would you do?
He disappeared in the crowd.
Do you not understand what is happening?
I am glad I found you.
Tom is an ambitious young man.
Do you think you are fat?
Tom divorced Mary last year.
Where did you hide my cigarettes?
This lesson is endless!
This box weighs a ton.
He gets everything because he’s a jupiter.
Sorry, I did not hear you.
He says he has never met her.
He seemed to be going to kiss me.
Do not go on me.
Have fun to you?
It is unlikely to happen.
I will order it later.
Did you know he was going to Boston?
This is our school.
Yesterday I was free all day and today I am working.
Take your coat, it’s cold today.
If I think, I really need a mobile phone.
Do not lose patience.
Why is Tom angry?
What a terrible man!
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Do not be angry at him.
You exceeded your powers.
The curse was destroyed.
My grandfather was born blind.
Tom is above you.
She injured her back while playing tennis.
Tom is easily scared.
This table is white.
It was a strange game.
I’ve heard of all your problems.
I know him for a year.
I will go to Boston with you.
Let me talk to Tom.
Last summer they went to a mountain resort.
Can you tell me where the nearest church is?
Stay away from there.
Tom and Mary are not afraid.
Can you get closer?
She is a little shy.
What do you expect from Tom?
She seemed completely calm.
Press the button.
Tom went to the museum with Mary.
Tom was intrigued by what was happening.
Mary was wearing shoes to her knees.
It is a lie.
I will follow them.
She said she was cold.
The road inspector was extremely rude.
He wants to follow in the footsteps of his father.
I see no problem here.
I don’t have to do it tomorrow.
He lost his sunglasses.
It is terribly bitter.
Did he tell you where he was last night?
I can pick you up on the way to work.
I don’t know what you are talking about!
Tom was the first.
All are different.
I have to see you.
I lost your phone.
Plant a tree out there.
Do you usually wear a bicycle helmet?
Tom will fix it.
Tom said goodbye to his sister.
My mother was busy cooking dinner.
I do not understand what you are trying to say.
The small pots have long pennies.
He was in sandals.
There is a bench under the tree.
Let me tell you what I want from you.
Are you going to stop me?
How about my story?
He turned off the alarm and fell asleep again.
Tom and Mary looked tired.
I heard you sing.
Tom and I are friends.
How well did you know him?
He often plays guitar.
I tried to warn Tom.
The train was full.
He rarely wears a tie.
You bought too much bread.
He says he does not plan to go.
I have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
Does he have a cable?
Whatever you say, I will not change my opinion.
Tom can talk.
Thank him for the help.
Tom could tell me.
This will bring unhappiness to your family.
I was very nervous.
Tom said I had to go.
I have to win.
It is useless to ask him for help.
Mary tried to sell her house.
You should try not to fall asleep.
My mom helps me a lot.
Tom has a tattooed snake on his back.
Have you bought meat in the supermarket?
He hit me by mistake.
What is the name of this dog?
Walk on the sidewalk.
I don’t think Tom knows who Mary’s father is.
The rain flows like from a cage.
The whole country is talking about it.
I can't wait to tell him.
You cannot buy happiness.
Tom grew up in a kindergarten.
I don’t want to watch this video.
Is the poorest country in the EU poorer than the poorest state in the United States?
Send a greeting to Tom.
I want to thank you for what you did for Tom.
I stumbled upon my friend.
Are you working with Tom?
They have voted.
Are you the only one who has the key to this door?
When did you ask her?
I remember Tom.
We were about to enter the room.
I feel polished.
Do not pour salt on my wounds.
We are not afraid.
Do you think we will win?
Their ropes are disconnected.
What did Tom and Mary teach?
Why did you park here?
I eat and drink.
He was once a street musician.
He doesn’t try to impress you.
How many aunts do you have?
I have to ask Tom what he will do.
Tom pulled the gun out of the cube and laid it on the table.
This program is still far from perfect.
Can you repeat what I said?
This scientific theory is controversial.
Ask him if he will come to the meeting.
It is big work.
History is about the past.
I can do it now.
We must try to stop them.
Tom and I bought that house on Park Street.
Do you know where Tom got that?
How long have you been there?
Do not congratulate me!
I turned the page of the book.
The force of water rotates the wheel.
Give me the oil please.
You are wet all over.
I will never work for Tom.
Many lives were broken.
I have to explain it to Tom.
They are not yet.
Are you upset?
They are very fun people.
We have nothing to talk about with you.
Mary told me she was cold.
He replaced Mary.
Did you know that Tom has relatives in Australia?
Monday follows Sunday.
Your table is ready, sir.
He only cares about the outside.
Let it yourself!
I often see Tom and Mary doing this.
The tree is too young to bear fruit.
I don’t want to go lunch with you.
Tom knows Mary is upset.
Tom told Mary to go to the hospital.
Causes are unclear.
I wish we were friends.
Tom told me to tell you that he was okay.
I’d rather stay home and hang up.
When do you need Tom?
I met my friend by chance.
I am whoever, but not a liar.
Tom has to relax.
I don’t think Tom will come back.
This book is new.
We are looking for our passports.
He sat on the bed.
He forgot his glasses.
The neighbor saw nothing.
I have heard everything about you.
Tom is economical.
Could you show me something else?
I’m sure Tom knows what happened.
I will do as you asked.
Please tell me about your company.
Where are you now?
Close the door when you leave.
Tom cleaned the potatoes and then opened them.
Tom could win.
My mother reads a magazine.
You love jazz, right?
She said she had a tough day.
Whatever happens, you have to stay calm.
The war ended in 1954.
I read about you in yesterday’s newspaper.
Give me money.
Tom lost the race.
