Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two leaders wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution being discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement building and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The deal Obama promoted on Iran's nuclear program has further strained the relationship between the two.
In March, at the invitation of Republicans, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech to the US Congress that was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, who had refused to meet with him in reference to the upcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, the professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In a distress call, Professor Shannon Lamb, in a somewhat trembling voice, told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house.
Lamb was keen to point out that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably upset, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note carved on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me". This was the letter, according to the authorities, and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the campus where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after.
By the end of the day, another death had occurred: Lamb took his own life as the police locked him up.
One day after the university shooting, which forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to get a sense of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators on both sides of the state, as well as the testimony of students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviour.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little agitated and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave, saying he had some sort of health problem.
He only taught two online courses that year.
Recent changes in the university's employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from campus, police later tracked Lamb back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up around here.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He got his PhD in education this spring.
One of Lamb's longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who spent a few years trying to teach her how to play the guitar.
He was the girl-swarm back then.
All the girls melted away when he was there", said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for a while.
The 911 call said "I killed my wife", but there was no marriage certificate.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house that adjoins a bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
"She was devastated", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together at one gig or another.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, after Lamb finished playing his guitar and harmonica in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign of anything wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were cleaning up and joking around.
I mean, they both had a good sense of humor.
Schmidt, the deceased professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and student committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, some 900 people, including faculty, staff, students, and community members, attended a candlelight memorial service on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the vigil, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The class will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to get our students to come back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb made the 911 call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb did refer to Prentiss as his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication that the two were ever married.
Toys R Us plans to cut staffing for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas-season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work longer hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with another 45,000 laid off by Christmas 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin interviews this month and increase staff numbers from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, Christmas business is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I realize the seat next to me is empty, and it's slowly becoming clear to me that Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film, "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it occurs to me that I'm a simulated yawning and arm's length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really", Spielberg said, "unquestionably the greatest time travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be released on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief reiterates his call for all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He deplored that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble".
Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria as they did in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
Eight polls that show Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top of the polls, it hasn't worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously question what it means for the chances of the real estate mogul's nomination.
Of course, it's too early in the election cycle.
No one is saying that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he should run in a general election.
But outsiders like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump's tenacity and starting to pour their dollars into trying to bring him down.
Here are some recent survey figures that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are holding up in the early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "upset" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same amount of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in line for excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, were to run.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post reported Monday.
The same number is in the nation's top-ranked state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Yet 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to run effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn't fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That's a change from the time four of the ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure, GOP voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28 percent for the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney.
Yet it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump would still beat almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the split is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is winning the majority of the vote.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they've formed their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that just over half of voters who support Trump say they have cast their votes firmly.
Of course, there is much that can be done to change that, and no one can really say that they will never change their minds.
46 percent said they'd leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump's strongest competitor at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've formed their own opinion are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in the public discourse of 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep key Hispanic Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems Donald Trump will too.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new ABC/Post poll Monday they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hell-angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea.
On the street, a square meter of a terraced house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"Sylt is naturally limited in the supply of objects", says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows which particular locations cost the most per square meter.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student's booth in Munich is not really a small amount.
Unlike Germany's top places to live, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square metre at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros per square meter, I'm sure.
But who can afford it?
By the way, Munich is not the best in this field.
Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goals in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just one run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piräus - and then it was over.
A great start to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan" in the witch's bowl of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League against the Greek record holder Olympiakos in hot weather thanks to Müller's double (52.90+2) and Götze's goal (89).
The twelfth start in the series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally take the Henkelpot to Munich in the third round.
Müller received kind help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed a shot from the world champion to pass as a flank shot.
"We will not underestimate them", Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 passionate fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and engaged performance without glittering.
Piräus had won his last six home games in the top flight, including against famous clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bavaria, undefeated in seven European Cup matches against Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by a game shift to left-sided Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Brunswick player Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right, when his flank from the right half-field hit the left upper goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2-0.
The best chances in the first half were Robert Lewandowski's.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the Poland's headball off the line (26).
Then, on live recording, the goalkeeper Roberto parred with his knee (35).
Although the Bavarians were playing their usual dominant game, Piräus was able to score.
But I had to rely on Manuel Neuer.
For example, when he directed a shot of ideas over the barrel (56).
Recently, Guardiola had a four-way tie with David Alaba in the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the squad, was initially sitting outside.
The World Cup champion gave the green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer on "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something else out of it, that's already evil".
Guardiola also decided against him on the first change, when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, at 11 metres Müller put another one on.
There was a riot in the stadium before the game.
After a small group of partly camouflaged Bavarian fans in their spectator block had apparently provoked the supporters of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with batons against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was taken out of the stadium injured.
Smokers are at greater risk of losing teeth
Smoking not only damages the lungs but also the teeth, suggests a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news is, if you give up, the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is shown by the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely than non-smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth decay are caries and inflammation of the gums, stresses the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, the authors stress that smoking is a risk factor.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to higher incidence of gum disease in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of cavities.
However, people who quit smoking may reduce their risk in a short time, write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it may take more than ten years for the risk to return to the level of nonsmokers, explained lead author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
"Smoking shortens life", explained study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE, "if people are to be persuaded to become nonsmokers".
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels, and we know that it also promotes good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time.
Near the site of the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-German Museum have unearthed skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called "ground monuments".
All building projects in the Cologne district involve the museum as a specialist office for the care of archaeological monuments.
The archaeologists were now found in the third section of the Rhine Boulevard.
Text documents had already shown that a fortress and a church stood on the site in the 4th century, Trier explained.
Besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman was killed in an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police are asking the public for help.
On the early Wednesday morning, at about 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks from the station building at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
The police say that she was severely injured by the train.
She was treated at the scene and taken to a hospital by rescue workers.
The investigating officers have no information as to the reason for the young woman's crossing of the railway at night.
The incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
The following are the questions from residents or passersby of the Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364).
Information on the cause of the accident can be obtained from the free 24-hour hotline of the Federal Police, telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes new court in TTIP dispute
To defuse the dispute over the proposed transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a major reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more similar in its functioning to traditional courts.
"We want to create a system that citizens trust", EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the launch.
The Swedish company intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA.
The German government announced support.
TTIP is to create the world's largest free trade area with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They are to come from the EU, the USA and third countries in equal shares.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow appeals against judgments.
The parties to the proceedings have so far agreed among themselves on arbitrators, whose judgments cannot be challenged.
In the discussion of the past months, it had become clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she says, she wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
It could also be used, for example, to settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries.
The investor-state arbitration (ISDS) procedures, which are particularly demanded by large corporations, are considered one of the main reasons for the strong resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which companies can seek damages at the expense of taxpayers, overturn national laws or enforce a lowering of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial comments, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
The criticism was mainly that they should not apply to the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta) which has already been negotiated.
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission is taking into account the main points of the reform which Sigmar Gabriel, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting business' ability to complain by introducing too many new rules.
It was said that this would be particularly disadvantageous for small and mediumsized enterprises.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances and their derivatives is currently being discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA.
The agreement was originally supposed to have a framework by the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to have expired.
Delicate folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Prime Club in Cologne (now Luxor).
Next to it is a flip chart, on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 persons, is almost enthralled by Stevens' talk.
He tells the story of various places, which he repeatedly marks on the map, as his minute and delicately arranged songs relate.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven himself to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
The third album, Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State, released in 2003, features cleverly composed songs that harmonize with late 1960s American folk but can be floated into great opulence at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" is the first part of a daring series, that each of the 50 states of the United States is to be sung in sequence.
But already in 2004 and in the Rhine area, "Seven Swans" has been published and it positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens is performing here on a reduced basis.
He's just playing guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
In 2005, a nationally acclaimed masterpiece was released, "Illinois".
Full of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs the American Billboard charts and is not missing from the annual best-of lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses electronic replacement parts extensively on "The Age of Adz" (2010).
This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and playing with all kinds of effects and hall.
As the smaller clubs rise, the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of neon umbrellas and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark, more hamburgers!
The programme is based on the 'Carrie and Lowell' programme, which has been running since March.
Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests confined to their seats, the much more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing the audience, the group of excellent musicians play through the broadly enriched album.
And you hear from the audience that the talk is "more opulent" and you can "basically throw the record away".
Stevens humbly thanks for an addition, plays acoustically a few older songs, and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, with his performance likely to be closely monitored by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less drama and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, coming after his appointment to the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and has been the focus of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn's leadership, citing differences on the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also "stacking up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's comments on the position on the European Union and the limitation on gains.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was proposing changes to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Labour and Pensions Minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, across the dispatch box in Parliament over the last decade.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given over 30,000 suggestions.
Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both "squatting" and arguing with counter-hooks and has instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will represent him when he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues should occasionally speak and that he had approached John Bercow, the Speaker of the House, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to distance himself from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theatre" often associated with the prime minister's question time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been seen as the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his fellow MPs, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shooting Joburg': homeless youths trained as photographers
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place to be when you're homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a way to learn a skill and make a living out of it.
I was shot in Joburg is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound rises as UK wages grow faster
The pound rose sharply on data indicating an increase in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, profit without bonus in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9% compared with the same period of the previous year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and the most accurate estimate of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to €1,3730 against the euro by 0.84%.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the dominant share on the market, rising by 20% following the takeover bid by rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% following encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again reporting growth.
Glencore's stock rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling by 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs had set its rating for the company at 'sell'.
JD Sports increased by 3,1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax profit of 46,6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are a threat to expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But he says it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs at his company.
The cost could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber's expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, the star of the show.
A handsome 21-year-old with a fancy haircut.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
More than that.
Mr Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
She's like a woman named Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
It's not bad.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
Among them were Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
But since 7 a.m., the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the luxury hotel in Potsdamer Platz.
This is where their idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite where the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much a day as her mom Ewa earns in six months.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria should be in the tenth grade of high school".
"I'm fulfilling her dream".
School?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Not even Bieber himself.
He's been all right.
He made three million dollars for the Super Bowl commercial break, a two-year deal with an anti-piquick company, and a lot of, a lot of dollars went into Bieber's account.
And any doll that looks like him and walks over the counter, Bieber's cashing in, too.
When Justin Bieber drinks coffee, you're looking at the window.
He's said to have taken over 100 million dollars.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others stress that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese to the idea of potato farmers
Potatoes or peas?
It is both - and this is the potato grinder, developed by Hani Alhay, a local baker.
Inspired by the saying "potatoes instead of doners" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
He got the idea from a poster at a Pegida demonstration that he had seen on TV that said "Potatoes instead of doner".
Since then, his shop has been running a grill with meat and potatoes.
"It's a multiculture for the stomach", says Alhay.
The Lebanese has registered his idea with the Munich patent office.
According to the Authority, it has been protected there as a commercial design for a short time.
Alhay therefore does not want to reveal how much meat and potatoes the spit contains.
He says, "It tastes even better together".
His customers also like the idea of international cuisine.
Metcash launches ground stability campaign to combat Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect IGA branches from an Aldi rally in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-breaking campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and social media marketing, as well as events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo, which distributes samples to IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
The stakes are high, as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30% in South Australia and 24% in Western Australia compared to around 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that within 12 months of opening its first markets, Aldi will grab around 5% of the food market in these two states and will take sales away from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Africa and 30 in WA next year, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and beverage business and in the volumes on Metcash's high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Eastern States, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in the food and beverage business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and by 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, the chief fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash made contact with Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and revenue from Metcash's food and grocery business, which serves some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting operational debt relief while putting pressure on sales and margins.
But the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores with faster growing fresh food and providing a better choice of private label food.
Metcash's CEO Ian Morrice says that price adjustments and store renovation programs will be attributed to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profitable growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian Tennis Association president Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who are often referred to as "Special Ks", came to the limelight after Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting, "Wawrinka should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit the kid".
While last seen crushing a tennis bat after a cramp thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty proud of is the fact that I think Thanasi got a little bit dragged into the fight", Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost the U.S. Open to a cramp, but he's not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But, really, he did extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little too harshly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the team and so on, he's never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in good shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to disregard Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision starting on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man to return as a long-term fixture on the team".
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And I think Nick has made the rise very quickly that people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he's rising in the public eye, and he's made some bad mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, some time out of the limelight where he can just think about it, I think is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's best for him.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone trying to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the flow of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries, and they built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian emergency police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 people who sought refuge in the stunned Italy and Greece, and expressed their hope that eventually, next month or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached for EU countries to take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not place its hopes on an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to manage the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it finished a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU states, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the four-meter-tall fence the government had built along the southern border with Serbia, and they also impose higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation created by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the military deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser to Orban, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border, with 15 others having already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come here by damaging the fence, they're now in police custody and are charged with committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are working on repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a wagon with barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and squeezed a crowd to force themselves into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed out.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would be denied food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national polls is cut in half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is winning against her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (58 percent previously), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is receiving support from 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primary.
With more than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they have a clear idea of which candidate they'll support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton has a big lead in women and moderates, but those lead have been declining.
Your support among the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind here.
Clinton's lead among Democratic voters under 50 has faded, and she and Sanders are now on par.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among the older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit margin in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the primary nationwide say they would be enthusiastic about supporting Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she's the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time for a woman to be president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
With the vice president weighing potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believe he shouldn't.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who their second choice for the party would be, Biden is leading.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is second by far in this measure, but the percentage who see him as the "most eligible" has risen.
Yet, when asked what's more important about a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
As in the past month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well on several important traits among voters in their party's primary elections.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the best candidate among the three candidates in terms of honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say so about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't think he is.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters don't think Sanders is right.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State continue to be asked, most Democratic voters in the primary are satisfied with her explanation of the matter, saying that it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than in May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, are getting good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates we tested, Biden, Carson and Bush were the best in honesty.
A majority of people think Sanders is more honest, but like Carson, many don't think about him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is ranked behind Donald Trump in national polls
Ben Carson is ranked just behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of the voter support in the new poll, and others are losing ground dramatically.
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23 percent in the last CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News debate to 27 percent in Tuesday's poll.
But Carson shot from 6 percent to 23 percent over the same period.
The poll also found Carson performs well among demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with a college education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is down, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker dropping the lowest, from 10 percent support last month to now 2 percent.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error in the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, and it was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows Carson rising in the polls -- he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump at 32%.
The most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll also put Trump ahead of Carson.
Looking at a rising Carson last week, Trump found some sidelines for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees Celsius.
Even if peak values are measured only at a distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for beachgoers to find still warm water.
A swim in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea at a maximum of 17 degrees is likely to be a rather short pleasure.
Some people are no longer going to the sea: the water in the North and Baltic Seas is at a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
The Mediterranean, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures of up to 29 degrees Celsius in the east.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees in the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch College freshman
Almost two years after a student died during a harassment ritual at a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, five people are being charged with murder.
Members of the New York City Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi fraternity brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded and loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked as he tried to get to a target over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 after Deng fainted and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and basically put the good of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng", said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
An autopsy report said Deng suffered repeated blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood's harassment, and at least one student has died every year since 1970 from the harassment", said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold not only the people involved responsible, but if there is an organisation that has sanctioned this - officially or unofficially - we will hold them accountable", Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
That's what's gonna happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike will come, and the boom will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this is all going to take and how long it's going to last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.
That is why representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but rather on the period of time needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement about an interest rate increase may have been exaggerated.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a news release to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect US interest rates to return gradually to normal levels, but to remain too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
But that does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at how some sectors of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset yields to stifle 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been mostly upward for the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hikes, pretty flat in the 250 days afterwards (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising interest rates often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What's most remarkable is that GDP will be near its lowest point in the Fed's interest rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 have only twice been below 4.5 percent of nominal GDP.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, and the Atlanta Fed expects only 1.5 percent for the third quarter.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and raise the question "whether it will be different this time", Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Fed rate hike all year, and all eyes were on this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC might approve a raise in this session, futures trading only gives a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, all the upward cycles from 1950 to the present have been in a super-cycle with increasing GDP momentum, eclipsing pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery", says the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession, the record being 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an interest rate rise and the pattern is quite similar to that in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, yields seem to change direction once the first increase/decrease in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists at Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to move closer together, leading to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious about expecting higher returns", said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market as the Fed tighten its strategy.
Overall, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and so will the financing of their debt.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets outperformed companies with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their shares also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is becoming a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock-play, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative MP criticized the station for its "dumbing down"
He argues that it is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also pointed to the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just imitating The Brits.
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" to Classic FM, claims a leading MP, and is increasing new pressure on the station to prove it is doing something private stations are not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster was "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'dumb' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He was also aiming at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just The Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you are actually just imitating what is already on the market", Mr Bingham said.
The BBC Director-General rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors in terms of live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there's a commitment to live music and to making music that's really unparalleled.
"And I also really value the commitment of Radio 3 to finding new music and commissioning new works", he said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, the controller of BBC Radio 3, argued that more work needs to be done to engage the public than it has in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production to come under fire during the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee hearing for trying to get its commercial rivals on their feet.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's music talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
You see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - be produced "in a special BBC manner".
He added that he wishes the company would "find a hit from our in-house stable" the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series from The Voice in the future or spending the fee-payers' money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose most slowly in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest since records began in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November slowed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total expenditure in August was the lowest growth since records began in 2000, up only five per cent on the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed growth of just seven percent in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, it's always evolved over time", Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when shoppers started to shop with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, like at home on the couch.
But now that's coming to a halt, and we may see growth slowing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining sales.
Experts believe that shoppers are holding back their purchases before this event, which is held on the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average number of shoppers who turned to their computers to make their bargains increased fivefold, and some retailers' websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers fought for bargains, could discourage shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than at the downtown fashion chains.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash - Bin Laden's family sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group in part
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca's Grand Mosque.
Mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the path to pay their respects as the first of the dead began their final journey to Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The mourning procession passed by the Holy Place, where just days earlier a construction crane had crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then onto the prayers.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king imposed sanctions on the bin Laden family construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshippers who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram was with his parents at the Grand Mosque before the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands continuing to flock to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin Laden group should not have left the crane's arm standing when it wasn't being used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's management was prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering ahead of the Hajj later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statement on the de Krans collapse and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also rebuked the group for not taking up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca's Grand Mosque as part of a massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades, taking on major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son who was expropriated by his family in the 1990s.
The wreath fell amid heavy winds and rain, just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured will get half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time for cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British people are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
This will result in the opening of 200 more screw-fix shops targeting artisans.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
By Rupert Steiner, the city's chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British are giving up their hammers and brushes in favour of the employment of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their homes
If you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you are likely in the minority today.
Because British people are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do homework in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, which owns the construction chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices had become obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B&Q shops, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the majority of employees are men.
She said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends, with more single women in households, who are doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We must move this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the purchasing decisions made by women.
Women play a large role in decision-making.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the helm of a leading UK company in the FTSE100 index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent of its staff made up of women, including its executive and finance board.
Mrs Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our board of directors.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in half-yearly profit and sales after the group incurred the costs of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob in court for treason
Two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob have had to answer for treason and tax evasion at the Klagenfurt Regional Court on Wednesday.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse of office.
He was acquitted of the charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to the Prosecutor General, Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants had used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to dispose of in their functions, for private purposes between 2006 and 2011.
He estimates the damage at about 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact excludes the chairman of the Schöffsen Council, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
The defence argued that the association had not suffered any material loss at any time.
The sports officials had only charged expenses and had taken the sports club, for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 schilling (about 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: should we continue the club or close it?" one of the defendants, who was a large-scale inspector at the tax office, told Bread.
He and his colleague and co-defendant then decided to take on this task.
At all the risk.
"We've put money down, our life insurance in the bank as collateral", he said at the settlement.
The association had agreed that they could manage the money freely, but that no debts should be made.
The Commission also decided, if the financial arrangements were successful, to pay the compensation retroactively until 1991.
As a result, part of the expenditure compensation was not paid out until years later, i.e. from 2003, when the account had been in surplus.
The former manager explained the proceedings.
The accounts and savings books were managed by the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association.
The association did not take an interest in the details of the financial disclosure, only the debt-free nature of the business was important, the answer was.
In 2011, when an investigation into the abuse of office began against one of the officials, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club's account.
The defendants explained that these were reserves.
This securities account was in the name of the second defendant and according to his statement was unknown to the association.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent did not know the answer to this question for a long time.
Then he finally said he thought it was the best thing for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known about the money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The official justified himself by saying that the co-accused had been informed.
This transfer was formulated as 'damage compensation'.
Why compensation? The judge and the prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he did not agree with this formulation because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what if the lawyer says, "You're all fucked with this".
"Am I a lawyer?" he asked.
The official further said that he never received a penny in salary, only bills for miles and diets.
He had charged the association 1,000 euros a month for meals, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
The accused could not produce any accurate records of the early years.
They explained that after a farm inspection, in which everything was assessed as correct, they were no longer kept.
The second defendant had also taken a mileage.
All withdrawals were made in cash, for which he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the three-year-old layoffs, the computer giant will cut more jobs when it splits the company.
The layoffs at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are endless.
The US technology group is planning to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment as part of its restructuring.
The company said on Tuesday that this would save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion).
The move will result in an additional charge of approximately $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The three-year-long job cuts of 55,000 have not been completed.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
After the IPO, Hewlett-Packard's stock fell 2.3 percent.
The Palo Alto, California, company which grew up with printers is currently splitting up: the computer and printer business will be consolidated in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The second largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo recently experienced a further disappointment in PC sales and weaker demand for its services from corporate customers.
In the third quarter to end July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5%.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
That's down revenue in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to the industry's change with a split and massive layoffs.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has only reacted late to the increasing number of customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and increasingly doing business online.
Whitman's restructuring plans foresee a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflict: Majority support for anti-IS training mission
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
61% of respondents said that other countries were conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with the Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed by 51 percent of those polled, while 20 percent would be in favour.
29 percent could not decide.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the exhibition until 27 September will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition on Thursday under the motto "Mobility connects".
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organisers of the VDA car association expect, as two years ago, about 900 000 visitors.
Violence at Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees at the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
Behind them, a police line had formed and behind the policemen, a water cannon was standing by.
Some 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones, sticks, and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials first used pepper spray continuously.
After that, the police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
That's how the group was disbanded.
The refugees have now retreated to await a moment.
A pregnant woman, apparently injured, was carried out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas cried.
Other refugees were choking and suffering from shortness of breath.
The Serbian police press officers were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
The ECB's interest rate decision time
The world is watching as the US Federal Reserve meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the crucial decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists interviewed by Reuters found that a little over half of those who thought the Fed would do this last week now think the Fed will hold out a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may be leaving the zero zone and starting a process of normalizing interest rates", said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is in relatively good shape, trillions of dollars are being added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
It has warned the markets to prepare for a raise, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday.
The shooter at Delta State University left an apology letter .
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleagues later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "he could undo it", authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 Monday morning.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency call center employee that the police should send officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night", and he also mentioned that there was a "cute dog" in the house, but that he "wouldn't bother anyone", but he'd probably be upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he wouldn't give it.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for his shots.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's mind".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also having an affair with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person".
They divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who's 19 and she was "dead in the water".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter's "absolutely best friend".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been seeing Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail".
When officers caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb pulled his car over, fled on foot, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university's website.
Stars who lost their lucky charms
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly struggles with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
I'm sure all of this is taking its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is restructuring its group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save with better organization alone.
150 of the approximately 1000 executives worldwide will lose their jobs as a result of the restructuring.
The pilot union is in the process of negotiating.
Lufthansa is restructuring its business structure and revaluing its subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to contribute about EUR 500 million per year to the results from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In the management team under Chief Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
The restructuring underlines the importance of Eurowings, which Spohr intends to use in future to compete with Ryanair and Easyjet.
The organisation of the 120,000-strong company has been complex up to now.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the trade union conflict with the Cockpit (VC) pilots' association, negotiations are to be resumed on Thursday following the strike which was stopped by the courts.
The union told me.
The subject of the talks is the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as soon as possible "with a forecasted record result in one year".
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the background is the economical concept of "Wings".
It provides that Lufthansa will outsource routes to its own low-cost airline Eurowings in order to fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morning Train to the South" paintings by Leena Krüger are on display at the Künstlerhaus.
The Finnish artist, who has been living in Göttingen for a long time, has created a selection of untitled works for the White Hall of the House, which encourage viewers to take a trip in gratitude.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United will be out for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg during Manchester's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
While this has made the left-sided full-back cry and will keep him out of the game for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital".
He'll be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It's terrible - a kid who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it really hard and then plays fantastically, and then this happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm no doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it'll take six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an 11-meter penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an 11-yard run and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my journey to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger".
In this connection: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The European Championship in France gives the England defender an extra incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury".
When a player leaves the field with that kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good", Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel really bad about it.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows the Lorax better?
It's something that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's website SuperCamps, and continues: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message that we've missed".
All fine and well, except that the following paragraph, where Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead gives a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"Amid the walled city of Thneedville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", it reads.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website, and begins: "In the walled city of Thneedville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, where an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is being ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, thneed-knitting once-ler despite the protests of the nameless Lorax, a squatting, moustached creature "who speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low-public relations task was delegated to a helper who had not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's precinct office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not provide any further immediate comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it's still hard
To face Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but when you look at the squad England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an overseas victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the side of three years ago, but there are good spinners in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear the scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even though he represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth is out of the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out of the game is, of course, difficult for me as his head coach in Yorkshire to analyse.
In his seven Tests, he had two good strikes in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There were no question marks on Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because -- and I said this earlier -- players are their own best picks.
Long ago, they would have extended Lyth's run, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he hopefully scores more runs for Yorkshire, there'll be another chance.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform as well, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team man first and foremost.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only blame that can be levelled is that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - but that missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a hitter that I value highly.
He's an X Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early in the season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He must at least get the same opportunities as those before him, but this depends of course on the team lineup in the UAE.
The idea of having Moeen batting alongside Cook, which would give him an extra spin bowler and four quicks, came up, and I'm fine with it.
I don't see why a batsman can't hit there, and this left-hander has already shown himself to be a devil of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's number three for them, and there's not much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first-row before he came on as an opening batsman in 2001.
He made three hundred runs at once and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited interaction with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his stats -- average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a point, but there's not a lot of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have gone for youth.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the squad, England have made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as the advisor for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he's gonna bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes in for the white ball phase of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful bet to the setup.
I always felt he was made for international cricket, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was said before.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not being used in the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for one, have no problem with that.
Some may disagree, but coaches and team leaders don't set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp could gain momentum if the economy falls into recession by 2017
David Cameron's unfinished renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper and deeper into trouble every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely fighting over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A friend of mine, a European diplomat, said recently that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain's self-created agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don't want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that it did not like them either if they endangered social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and finance ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they're winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants an outward looking Britain inside the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin - and points out that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-term ones like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks to be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
It's also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to imagine that they're going to pull out a leg to help the selfie-makers, whose energy should be better spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK, something they don't want to do either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So it's possible that some of these ministers are even deliberately planning unhelpful SNP-style remarks during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation".
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics are the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired referendum of 1975, which supported our accession in 1973 by a ratio of 2:1.
You may remember Boris Johnson, the prime euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an EU-grade banana correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
For all his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-crazed crooks, phone-hacking foreigners and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our big newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought the same about them, but he realized that when you're sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you'd better hand out bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron's referendum whirlwind, because Blair had put the principle over the unapproved EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, opening a back door for him.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who kindly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn't need to waste any more time on me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he's got to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC couch he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I say it kindly - in the development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip's traditional blue-colored tendency and the wilder fields of Tory petty-Englishness can probably all say yes to that.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week, as the Boy Scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocateur John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old dad was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay "under any circumstances" was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC reportedly told his fellow fighters and members of Congress at their Monday night hearing.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn is trying to convey - remember, he touched even me - news discipline remains important in the age of 24-hour TV and above all in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe which would allow him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks that too.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in keeping with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything to their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be pointless?
The United States is already pretty disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost cut by the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of when I started on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE based its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in the BMJ and have asked whether the claims are "built on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said that the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their opinions on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO is said to have previously received funds from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed the public health references of BAT in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said he was receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the tobacco management of PHE.
The group's research "significantly acknowledges" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for harm in most products under most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there is no evidence yet that e-cigarettes are a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had been reacted to before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking".
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are comparatively low, but that we still need to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By presenting clear, current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should drop EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop airing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not broadcast by other UK stations.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in highly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and from stations such as BBC4.
After BBC Director-General Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to contact the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC is commissioning or broadcasting programmes that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidised rivals", Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don't think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce your own programmes that others don't make or commission.
They're broadcasting The Voice in a prime time window because they want to get as much support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax would fund programmes that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both of them are in-house productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what this public service broadcasting is supposed to be like.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the ratings hunt "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky head Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-minded niche programmes "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programmes that nobody's seen".
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I would urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for 150 pounds a year you get a lot of value here, but for people who for 150 pounds is a lot of money, ask me if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said that very little of the BBC's production is now officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 percent of their TV production and 0.1 percent in radio - and they should take the example of the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada and change this to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like the proms, which he said are only shown on a handful of TV channels, and form alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
Sonogenetics can control brain cells by sound waves
This video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses whose frequencies are too high for human hearing to hear.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new process called sonogenetics, which can use ultrasound to activate a range of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses into the brains of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Flatworms don't usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves open these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are attached, reports Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The method has some similarities to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down a fiber optically to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and thus be sent into the brain from above the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads are a disgrace to Britain's arms trade
Watching an Amnesty International anti-gun video.
They're terrible killer drones.
Leg shackles that shatter joints!
We got bombs!
And electroshock sticks that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a militant parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to smuggle weapons to repressive regimes via the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are seen at bus stops and on subways that require a second look.
"Important notice: Are you travelling on the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is what is written in the fonts of the London Underground and the DLR line's trademark sign, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be traveling with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismal Land.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London, using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of insertion keys that are claimed to "gain access to around a third of the bus station advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London is not amused by this "vandalism" poster.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists who work with activists within protest movements realize that they need to go out into the real world for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook, was created by the VCCP advertising agency, which works with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the arms show's advertising - through a blank spot on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic shady corporate ad, but "the inflation of bright colors and animation keeps it sticker".
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair", says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside ExCeL, where exhibitors are shredding fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals a US Army order for "the shoulder-launched AT4CS RS".
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding post-impact effects inside the target".
Whatever this is, it's not gonna be pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in student housing
Eleven years ago, I moved into a student residence as a self-absorbed 19-year-old, still believing in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I've irritated - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into student housing can range from slightly nerve-racking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to chat: people tell you where you're from, whether and where you took a sabbatical, where you stand with Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room".
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It's a way to steer the conversation and help you find the people you like as opposed to the people you wouldn't talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and those were fire extinguishers.
Let people.
People's rooms are often transformed into drinks receptions, movie night venues and community meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and put on their underwear.
So, in this context, don't think about starting a relationship in college.
Introverts get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student housing projects are a room-to-room culture of socializing, which can lead to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave so I can get back the energy I spent interacting with you".
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my dorm had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
Since you're starting college at the height of the baking craze, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less weird than the 1950s greeting, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. So, now, please smile when I ask you a few personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to talk, and they may end up associating your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Badly mixed chunks of flour, sugar and fat make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, chewing chicken is stealing, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea, too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are, they'll say self-service, even if they're cooking inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my roommate, who added detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make noise that'll keep people from sleeping or from working.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that you are, in the truest sense of the word, one of the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind turning the drum and bass down a bit, because it's three in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two hours before she let her own music chatter, locked her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm?
Conversely, wouldn't it be deeply embarrassing if you thought a roommate was your future spouse, got hooked on her, broke up again, and then had to see her every day and maybe watch her drag all your mutual friends over to her?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense into your gut.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between an ulcer and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it only takes moments for it to become a boomerang.
Hide can be a valuable and fun lesson in safety - but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door, put your keys in a glass of water, and then put it in the freezer - but do not lock your belongings on the ceiling more than twice.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a special centre for the development of the European audiovisual sector.
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds rowhouses in the Eckental area of central France for people who don't have much money.
So for example for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income earner".
"I show how to build cheaply and well even today", says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner thinks he knows how to create affordable housing quickly: He builds rowhouses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will be pressing into the housing market.
What solution do you propose?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms is not sustainable.
Because most people stay here.
The European Union is a country of the former Yugoslavia, which is now a member of the European Union.
A very mundane, three-story rowhouse is the solution.
A row house is the least space-consuming.
It makes integration easier.
It's different when you put people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses currently under construction in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each apartment has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt to suit their needs.
What's the cost?
Gildner: The price for 160 square metres of living space per house is 184 000 euros, without land.
It's all right.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate your plans?
I've done my project correctly.
The threat of the sword of Damocles and the special construction and the site regulations make it particularly complicated.
It's creepy.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a rowhouse needs at least three places.
Only in the cities is there no place for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to your row house project?
There have been some who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But don't you increase the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It's true: we've had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that even normal people need housing.
Not just refugees, but also the single mother or the low-income earners.
I'll show you how to build cheap and well today.
That's what it's all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro-systems engineering in Regensburg and initially worked in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple updates are released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it's ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, as they receive an error message that says "Software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush recedes or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to make room -- but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update, and it will also be easier to do so by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue, as the phone may shut down halfway and this could result in an interruption of the update.

Rosberg's only motto is full attack.
Nico Rosberg, in the fight for the Formula 1 world title against his clear-leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, has only one motto: "Full attack".
The World Champion emphasized before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, "that I have nothing left to lose".
53 points separate the reigning world champion from defending champion Hamilton before the evening race in Singapore this Sunday.
The Briton has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also the favourite to take the city-state floodlight Grand Prix.
In 2009, and last year, the 30-year-old Briton won the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
A smoke alarm has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The Chess Club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", which was founded three months ago, has added another member, bringing the number of members to 19.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has spent more than 40 years in Bad Kissingen for treatment.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Federal Cross of Merit 1st class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Chess Club in Bad Kissingen was supported by Gauselmann with a donation which was accepted by its chairman, Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to take in chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth employment and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" be seen as an expression of his connection with the Kurstadt.
Headquarters is looking for direct contact.
Saludis and the Antonistift Centre for the Elderly have joined forces under the umbrella of the Social Foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to counselling, you can also attend courses.
The social foundation is pulling it down the mountain into the city.
More specifically, the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new headquarters office was recently opened there.
The Commission has also been involved in the development of a number of initiatives to improve the quality of care for older people and to improve the quality of care for older people.
For years, we've been finding out with our outpatient care service that caregivers are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
"Many benefits from the health insurance system are also not often used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood", explained the new housekeeper, Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as the Amadeus ambulance service.
In addition to counselling, the new headquarters office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The Saludis were brought on board.
Therefore, additional services such as fall prevention, memory training, or physiotherapy may be used.
The services of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complementary.
Saludis is for prevention, care and rehabilitation.
"The senior care centre", said Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new headquarters office in the city centre is due in particular to demographic change.
This makes good decentralised infrastructure in the different districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasised at the inauguration ceremony, the headquarters office is also dedicated to solitude in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular social gathering".
The social foundation thus makes a major contribution to helping older people live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The headquarters office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon.
The match between Bamberg and Würzburg Kickers on 6 October
Now it's official: after renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-tier Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set, the date was now set for October 6.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth round of the Bavarian Football Totopokal against the third-tier FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalized.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6th at 7pm at the Fuchsparkstadion in Bamberg.
"We are happy that we now know when the game will be on stage, we now have planning certainty", says FCE team manager Karlheinz Hämmer, who also points to the ticket pre-sale that has now started.
It's a special thing for our team to play against a third-tier.
We are therefore hoping for a large audience, and not without reason, because floodgates have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams FC Eintracht Bamberg entered 2010 by victories at the district league 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition will receive 5000 euros and qualify for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The defending champion is third-tier relegation SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died aged 92
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the artist's house announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as the broadcast said.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to furnish the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Lobkowitz Palace into the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Tim Wiese throws money at a police officer
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been unpopular in Bremen.
Tim Wiese, former German national goalkeeper, and former Bremen and Hoffenheim player, wrestler.
He says he's gained 30 pounds of muscle in the last two years.
But he didn't grow intellectually.
Wiese was getting his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking attendant outside putting out a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as reported by the "Bild" newspaper.
The city of Bremen has confirmed the allegations, but is still unclear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under examination", says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether or not to display Wiese.
Panama authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the growth of marijuana plants.

Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are being sought for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, at about 23.45, three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about 15 feet, police said, and shouted at them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the height of the bft petrol station.
Three persons were also on the premises of the gas station.
One of the men shouted at the youth and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a fractured nose and was bleeding heavily from the nose.
When his two friends came running and talked soothingly to the assailant, the assailant first abandoned his victim.
The wounded young man was now taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group in a car to their apartment and drove by them several times in a demonstration.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the victim went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the assailant and another male.
With the aid of a baton, the victim was beaten on the face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far, there's only one vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about six feet tall.
The second shooter is said to have been about 5'6" tall and was wearing jeans and a brown-white shirt.
Police are asking witnesses and informants to call 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Felstehausen and invests EUR 310000
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) are taking over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
In many rural areas there is a shortage of doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will be providing half of his job to his successor in the coming months.
After a period of renovation, Müller reopens the practice on 12 October, by which time he has invested 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Fälstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verdener hospital and also wants to start practicing next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice", says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen, laughing.
"When it was time, I just called her".
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf.
"We find it very attractive to be close to patients and to have constant contact with them", says 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet the families and accompany them through the years".
He also sees it as an advantage to be his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Muellers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
The double father Frank Müller also grew up there, following his medical studies in Hanover, he worked in several medical offices and in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a general practitioner in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz and is involved as a volunteer in the DRC-preparedness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From 19 September, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Muellers, both internists, want to settle down as family doctors.
"The endoscopy is coming out", says Silvia Müller-Gongoll, 38, who has been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We're going to be offering more ultrasound scans and long-term and stress EKGs, and we need an extra conference room.
The computer will also be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a grant of EUR 50000 from the county (25000 euros) and from the Velvet Community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued", emphasises Bernd Bormann, mayor of Velvet.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2000 patients come to the practice in Felshausen every quarter. In the northern German average practice, there are about 500.
There is another family doctor's office in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the takeover by Frank Müller is that the pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If she hadn't found a successor, she would have left too.
The Müller consultation will continue to be a favourite of those who visit the meeting: the seven medical staff and the cleaning staff of the rock houses.
Their departure marks the end of an era in Asendorf, where doctors have practiced for 30 years.
"At first we had only two rooms", Ursel Felstehausen recalls with a smile.
She's feeling a little sad after all this time.
"But we still live in Hohenmoor and will probably see many patients more often", says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: "We have a 6,000-square-foot plot".
"I've always been a gardener, but now I might be".
The couple also have two grandchildren and enjoy traveling.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Now border controls are being increased at our southern border", said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will be maintained at the same time.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can make it "self-evident".
The supply and safety of the people is paramount.
The Commission is also aware of the need for clear signals, the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers 'corridor' - Slovenia is denied
The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia was also planning to allow arriving refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and that it might also build corridors for the refugees.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the European Union.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the EU's external action to include the implementation of the Schengen acquis.
The border with Croatia, as the external border of the Schengen area, is already heavily controlled.
The Minister stressed that Slovenia does not want to close its borders to refugees.
"Each EU member has to fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work", emphasised Györkös Znidar.
The Croatian government said that the first refugees had already tried to cross the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing in eastern Croatia in the early hours of Tuesday to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick her up in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, with new refugees since then.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects to receive around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were being diverted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government, however, denied that it was it that was instructing people to take certain routes: "We cannot, nor do we want to do this", it said.
According to media reports, the first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the morning, and more buses were expected later in the day.
From Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border, some 300 miles [500 km] away, through Serbia.
"We heard that Hungary had closed, so the police told us to come here", said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more westerly route, as observers have already predicted.
Croatia: 'Extensive possibilities for border control'
Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that as a non-Schengen member, Croatia has "extensive border control capabilities".
The European Union is a member of the European Union.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, and the EU partners have consistently given the country a good reputation for the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees will now continue to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure the public at a local checkpoint in Horgos on Wednesday morning: he considers the debate on alternative routes for refugees, now that the Hungarian border is closed, premature.
It would not be a very large number of refugees at present.
It is not yet known whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants on dangerous alternative routes
However, private Hungarian aid agencies have already started to distribute maps to refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe, however: parts of the border area still contain unexploded minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers had been sent to the border region.
Hackers: Ukrainians are paying $30 million
Supranonok is alleged to have been part of a cybercriminal ring accused of having repeatedly obtained access to unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information they obtained was used to insider trade in the financial markets.
In this way, investigators estimate that a total of over $100 million was raised.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders are eventually caught", the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have operated from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
The parade grounds in Mannheim are busy.
People do their chores, sometimes walking quickly, sometimes comfortably strolling.
They're heading for the two stations at the Mannheim Motor Show on Paradeplatz.
The railway.
Pulsating, pompous life in the beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large plates each with the headline "Before I die, I want to"...
The ecumenical hospice movement has been celebrating its 20th anniversary with this campaign and is facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went into the city and into the people", says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Service is available for questions and conversations with passersby, as are the volunteers.
While some passersby spontaneously pick up the chalk and add the phrases "I'm going to live", "I can read", "I'm going to drive my camper around the U.S"., "I'm going to stop the war", or "I'm not going to suffer for long", others stop, read, say phrases like "I'm not there yet", and then move on.
Again and again, small discussions develop on the margins about the action itself, about life, about dealing with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on the scene.
"Only when I realize that the end of this world is coming for me can I live responsibly", says the director of the Mannheim Diaconal Work, which is the sponsor of ecumenical hospice care with the Charity Association.
So this publicity campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
It is understandable that not everyone on the boards wants to communicate publicly, because it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed much to people opening up.
A view shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and bereavement assistant is one of the first hour volunteers.
Confronted with the subject through personal experience, she read much literature and decided to become involved in assisted dying.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Service was looking for volunteers, she immediately volunteered and was present at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected person and their family in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and St Vincent's Hospice.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is very good at her job and the experience she has gained.
"I see life from a different perspective, treating it as precious and appreciating the moment", she says.
The provision of the outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and independent of any denomination.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations make it possible to provide training, training and supervision for those who are accompanying the dying and mourning.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now on display in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in pre-market trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said it would earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook comes despite price increases, which average 4.9%, taking effect on 4 January and higher surcharges for heavy and large parcels carried by road from November onwards.
The company said that it nevertheless expected the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and due to the growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "is delivering solid returns when you consider the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from the prior year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by the 12 analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in its international priority shipping in recent years, which has led to a stagnation in its express unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenues from ground transport increased by 29%, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in freight business.
In pre-market trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with an 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists are spending two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Overhead, at one end of the ornate two-story meeting room, is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of everything else.
The Fed has a twofold mandate from Congress: maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-factor in a decision that's too narrow to predict, and it's going to be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start, to be weaned off the unprecedented stimulus from the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most data on the economy shows that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make already cautious Fed officials fearful of increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds - even by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they're looking at", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting", she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg have predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a raise.
This indicates a decline in the stock market should the Fed raise the rate, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that another increase is far off.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point", he said.
If she does, "she would have to go to great lengths in her statement to reassure the financial markets so that they do not panic".
Other experts argued that raising interest rates would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 percent last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has been consistently below the central bank's annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can and needs higher interest rates because of the strain on the labor market", said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world contracted late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below its May high.
For Fed officials, market turbulence influences the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn't occurred over the past few weeks, they would have pulled the plug at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts she'll wait at least a month to better handle the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so it should not be technically included in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere mention by then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "squeeze" its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that are apparently not tied to the economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee who advocates an interest rate increase, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited discernible effects on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee.
The recent turbulence is not coming close to this level, he said.
"It certainly doesn't want to be in a situation where it's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are upset", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and doesn't mention financial stability, and until that's changed, I don't think it should be ahead of the curve.
You need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown
The market/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yeah, he's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The market/store is a central hub, offering a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and utensils, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There's even an auto department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the hallways.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there's a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and cheap) in this store is near the checkout and has various take-out options.
What's in here: do you need anything - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is large, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and even fry it for you if you wish.
A good part of the store is the massive freezer department, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, natural pork intestines, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods, and more.
Who's shopping here: restaurant owners and chefs, single families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You'll find fresh monthong durian here by the register.
Where it's located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown -- a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well-attended, it's not hard to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life-saving aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
The warm welcome you are about to receive is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda too, there are a number of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher by heart and soul.
Even with her 74 lenses, she still enjoys teaching.
She does it every Thursday at the asylum on Dillinger Street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn German.
Of course, this is a very different class than a real school.
Brazil's Rio Grande Paediatric Society is promoting nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to educate women in a shocking way about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts that are painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is a rich source of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the added energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can negatively affect a child's immune system.
Exemptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The Bernried municipal council approved the construction of the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattened for solar installation.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium at the Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: at the most recent municipal council meeting, the drafted building proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The Commission has also decided to grant a 'deferral' or 'exemption' from the existing building plan.
The 'exception' was the authorization of a special form for roof construction.
The project is to build a 'saddle roof with non-central front and roof overhang'.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This will give us a wonderful large southern roof together", explained Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
The 'liberation' was again the roof slope, which for energy reasons - unlike the building plan - is to be below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof slope - whereas the Bernrieder municipal council is usually rather restrictive in its approach to exemption requests.
However, the construction of the gym is not a recurring project: "We are not creating a precedent", Steigenberger says.
The construction of the gymnasium at the sports centre is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
The costs are estimated at around EUR 2.3 million.
Grants are expected from the school and outdoor sports funding.
The next step is to submit the building proposal for the 18 x 36 metre hall to the Landkreis Office for examination.
The Peißenberg Hospital moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is scheduled to close earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plan of the hospital GmbH of the district, which was confirmed by the councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
The decision on this matter, however, is to be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet next Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were implemented, all the staff of the Peißenberg hospital would be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who cannot come to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
The staff are informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been Medical Director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who should succeed him, Jochner-Weiß said the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and move with his team to Schongau.
For the Schongau-based company, this means an "upgrade" and an expansion of the offer in the area of "internal medicine", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is a specialist in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
Fischer and his team will run both houses for the next two years, if the Supervisory Board agrees, until the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be closed down in Peißenberg next year after almost 140 years.
The district had previously planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation of the Weilheim hospital is completed.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
"I'm not going to do that". As far as the real estate is concerned, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there were several considerations.
It is currently home to a Caritas short-term care and a day psychiatric unit.
"We couldn't have done it better, we won't get another chance like this", said Fischer of the near-move to Lech, which was welcomed by the staff "positively and with great understanding".
There was no real prospect for the house where Fischer has been chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by his colleagues in Schongau to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Peißenberg hospital (100 beds) has been threatened with closure in recent decades, with departments being closed, such as surgery and maternity.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are called to the Bergische HC tonight (20:15).
The Bundesliga leader is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badener suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire while harvesting corn on Tuesday afternoon.
During the morning rush, several hunters were on duty in a cornfield near Pratau, Wittenberg, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old man and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident could have happened was unclear at first.
The Criminal Police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violent crime
A suspect has led the police to the body of a 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old confessed to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old girl from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecutor's office and police said on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old man who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who reportedly confessed to the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had failed to return home the night before after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen as agreed.
In their search for the young woman, investigators first came across personal effects of the victim.
Interrogations with friends and acquaintances of the missing persons eventually led to a suspicion of the crime against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The arrested man confessed to the police in his interrogation, killing the 16-year-old and dumping the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was scheduled to appear before the magistrate on Wednesday, and investigators are charging him with murder.
The further investigation will provide further information on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need shelter: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are also seeking affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arrival of refugees and jobseekers from the EU, more and more people are pressing into a market that is already overcrowded in many major cities.
They're competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built each year by 2020.
This is the conclusion of a study commissioned by the Association for Social Housing.
By way of comparison, this year 260,000 units will be produced in Germany.
That leaves 140,000 apartments.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in a first-aid home as asylum seekers.
Many then enter the housing market and line up in the long lines in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers were living in rented accommodation last year.
The negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also highlights significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing from year to year.
The study's author, Matthias Günther, complained that there were already around 770,000 housing units missing in the urban areas.
Many workers in large cities were therefore forced to live in WG rooms.
Young adults were unwillingly staying longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the housing bubble.
In the large cities, the number of square metres per head has fallen for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a new start.
New incentives are to be given to social housing.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to adopt a decision on the proposal for a regulation on the taxation of land and buildings.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
The support programme for refugee accommodation by the Staatsbank KfW is already well received by towns and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the available €300 million had already been called in on Monday evening, with €184 million.
Now the project could even be boosted.
The European Union and the EU are committed to the implementation of the EU's common foreign and security policy.
Hungary is virtually impassable, with more and more refugees choosing to travel through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow unimpeded passage through Slovenia to the north.
But the route is dangerous.
Croatia is seeking to negotiate with its neighbour Slovenia the establishment of a refugee corridor.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organise a corridor", said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have set off for Croatia, from where they will be able to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border near Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws, which came into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees through.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: 'They can travel through, and we are preparing for that possibility.'
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
But they were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia with neighbouring EU country Croatia in the morning.
Most of the media reports came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by bus and by taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter any border fences.
But the border zone is also fraught with other dangers: There are still mines from the Yugoslav civil war of the 1990s.
Mine cleaners should now quickly make a safe passage.
However, the closure of the border has led to a decline in the number of refugees arriving in Hungary.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before Monday's closing, it had been 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws make it a crime to cross and damage the border fence.
In the southern Irish border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
Those convicted face up to five years in prison and deportation.
According to the Immigration Service, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday at the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the main crossing of Röszke.
The applicants included 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
But in practice, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary's view, Serbia is a 'safe third country'.
Refused asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees were still gathered outside the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning up.
They were collecting the trash that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barricades have been removed and one of the reception centres at the border post has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this rebuilding.
The closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary has left Austria with few refugees.
The country has also stepped up border controls.
But the government says that some 20,000 migrants are still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for their next trip to Germany.
The train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
Freilassing was regularly visited by small groups of refugees on foot.
Mayor drove "stranded" across the border
"We were cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent", says Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they were going to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had suddenly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the influx of refugees, they were done in Wernstein", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded people, along with two other helpers and their cars, across the border to nearby Passau.
Before we had the unexpected guests, we tasted them with juices and drinks.
We said we'd take her to Passau by car.
"This was a matter of course for us", Stadler said in an OON interview.
They were very grateful.
One man was not afraid to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased", says Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had boarded an ICE train in the evening of Sunday in Wels, and were on a regional train heading for Passau, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that train services to Germany had been suspended.
The regional train was stopped at the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border travel is generally high.
The bridge festival was a social event with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday, the day before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
Viktor Orbán's sending tens of thousands more to us is the logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping to establish structures to guarantee humanity in the Röszke camp, our Chancellor has officially and publicly cast the attitude of the Hungarian government in the mist of National Socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the "promised land" that has invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, to create humane conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-proof quarters
Konrad is busy with the refugee shelter.
Christian Konrad is used to having his word count.
The government has employed the formerly powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the Traiskirchen first-aid center has already gotten under control of Konrad.
"We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen", he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday was also done without much fuss, Konrad said, praising the organizational "masterpiece".
The Ministry of the Interior, on the other hand, described the situation as "crisis-like".
In total, Konrad expects a need for 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet this figure, another 35,000 shelters will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's not a barrel without a bottom", said Konrad.
He's already held talks with the county chiefs.
They would have assured him that they would also provide quarters for the refugees who were coming.
"Upper Austria is doing well", said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-man is supporting Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, to clarify how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also has high expectations for the ORF's "Help Like Us" initiative.
The platform allows private individuals to offer accommodation without any complications.
And they're hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Yesterday, Konrad and Maier criticized the standards for housing as "very high".
In times of emergency, it is not necessary for landlords to maintain a certain height of towel racks or the size of the headlights.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal.
The fact that he is more successful in providing accommodation than the Ministry of the Interior is proved by Konrad's experience.
I'm an old gentleman who can't be told the truth in the face.
He said persuasion was his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the Republic any costs, as they themselves stated.
They want to increase their staff to three or four.
The search of the quarters has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container in Stephansplatz as an office.
But there are obviously problems with the permit.
Linz calls for better distribution
For now, the city of Linz plans to close down municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the period of time allowed for the implementation of the measures.
However, other sites will be assessed for emergency use.
The mayor is critical of the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also play their part.
Seehofer: 'Border is not being sealed'
In a lengthy telephone conversation with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the next steps in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be sealed.
The continuation of the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is possible.
But we are now having the appropriate border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be running for the time being.
However, the refugees would be taken to Germany by regular trains.
The European Union has a long history of supporting the fight against terrorism.
The fact that Austria is now also reintroducing controls at its borders is a "logical consequence" of the German action, Pühringer said.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the "Neue Werft" in the Linz industrial zone is officially completed.
Four of the six floors of the office and production building have been taken over by the listed IT group S&T, while the remaining area (2700 m2) is to be leased to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us", says S&T head Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies in the New Yards and later acquiring some.
From the outset, S&T has been keen to cooperate with its new neighbours - something Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time".
S&T invested €1.7 million in the site, €3.3 million from the Techcenter, which is owned by one third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Republic of Germany (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
Thirty percent of the remaining 2,700 square feet of the building are already rented, and another 40 percent are in the process of being requested.
Lia Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
The new store is focused on furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit was going to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni's Pigeon Market arcade had to postpone the project for a while: finally, she has now been given an extension in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the shop, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the Furla brand, wallets are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories can cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
"I've been thinking about opening a shop for a long time", says Breit.
The decision was influenced by the fact that the furla producers, who are based in Bologna, were also interested in the idea of having their own shop where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand", says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her interest in fashion was instilled by her mother.
I'm most comfortable when something is developing and I can show you new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women are delighted at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the expert cannot answer with the utmost certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag adds value to any outfit.
The noise maker from Kallstadt
Donald Trump's Pfalz ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called boasters.
This quality is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for a riot.
Whether he is speaking xenophobically, attacking journalists, or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis politics, the candidate for the presidency of the United States is a powerful influence on the election campaign.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the town of Kallstadt in the Palatinate, where the real estate billionaire's grandparents came from.
The New Yorker with the hairpin is a familiar name to many in the wine country.
Some in the 1,200-strong village is related to him in over a dozen ways.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The cold-towner Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it a bit exciting, but they're not so impressed with their Kallstadter style", says Simone Wendel.
The native of Kallstadt has made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprouts, which include the Ketchup family Heinz, along with Trump.
Trump, who is not known for his modesty, also speaks in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - saying that he would surely be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family's accomplishments, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is "already a bit of a big mouth", Wendel says.
Coincidentally, the nickname Kallstadt has in the area is "The Roarers" - in High German: the boasters, she says.
So Trump comes from the boasting village.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his late grandfather emigrated to the United States and opened a gold digger's shop.
The real estate company was founded on the first purchases of land in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not without tragedy: their desire to return permanently to their homeland failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He didn't take Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of False History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film to start.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant".
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the posterity.
He had repeatedly spoken derogatory words about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"The poltergeist is not so nice", says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump's ("Grandma was born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American as distant, "he's always so hot".
Does he think Trump's gonna show up?
"I can't imagine that", says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The pensioner Veronika Schramm, like many Kallstadters, mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family made a donation to the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
"I can't imagine that from Donald", says the 68-year-old.
She would prefer if he didn't win the election because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those in charge in his grandfather's time in the United States had been like him, "he would never have gotten there".
"There are more interesting subjects than him", says Winzer's daughter, Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president", she says.
And, "The grapes are ripe without President Trump".
Wendell's film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, has been seen by 12,000 cinemagoers, and interest is also being aroused in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain village".
The village of 1800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the prize for soft tourism on Wednesday by the Vice-President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
There are already 20 "mountain villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring countries, the local Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of the Today Show leadership.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson are rushing to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it hasn't produced any major shifts in Today's ratings.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the nation's capital when Malcolm Turnbull brought down Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance seemed to be of no consequence to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase from the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number was behind last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has averaged 349,000 viewers to 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change are affecting these people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking.

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive viewing figure of 1.219 million.
Critics had questioned whether Thomson could wear a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear "yes".
Seven's The X-Factor remained strong with 1.136 million viewers, slightly beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30), hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and in the second half hour, a whopping 720,000.
Hot seat average is 620,000.
The drop in ratings for the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot Seat will finally take over at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to top the McGuire Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
A Secret Revealed . . .
Lana Jeavons Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly revealed who the winner of The Bachelor is.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons fellows the day before three becomes two, you may have accidentally given a hint as to who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday.
All three women lyrically talked about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?" her answers could become the game-winner, who won the bachelor's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name Mackay as Wood's best partner, except for themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house and noticed [Sarah's] and Sam's energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is on the ground, it's so fun to be with her", Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They're comfortable and comfortable together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good fit.
From her perspective, Mackay said that the house call last week made her realize that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm totally into him now", she said.
And when she was asked who else Wood should vote for, she was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say that", she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday, 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the U.S. -- and there were many other teams that sent in inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a smart decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a brawl like the Aussie rugby league convert did on his first punt return Tuesday in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to make a punt return and also into the running game after an injury by Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead of kicking his rookies in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his missed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne hits on a punt recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn't the start Hayne and his massive Australian fanbase had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens, you just worry about the next game, and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at in his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian military training ground.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his Yukos oil company seized and his democratic efforts hampered.
The Free Voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW autumn term in Großwallstadt of a serious crisis in Bavarian schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse", Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system".
The Free Voters' parliamentary group will meet in the sub-Francish commune until Friday.
In fact, the main themes were quite different.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voters' Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will override the clause", Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN refugee zones in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"We can't go on like this, we have to get to the root cause", said the Free Voter Leader.
Refused asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as quickly as possible.
Aiwanger also asked for more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum cases: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges", Aiwanger said.
The FW-head criticised the fact that several federal states were not consistent: "We need unified standards of the federal states nationwide".
"Bavaria pushes, others do not".
"We need to be more proactive".
But the national policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
A long-standing issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot project "middle level plus" in 47 secondary schools, testing an extension of the secondary level from three to four years - as a result, it will take another nine years to complete the final year of secondary school.
But Aiwanger is not going far enough.
"The G9 issue must be accelerated", said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free ride on the G9 wherever you want.
Wall Street is getting stronger, Dax is getting the jump.
The German stock market closed with profits after a long period of directionless and nervous trading.
It was only in the afternoon that a firmer start in the US markets gave a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The medium-sized MDax gained 0.54 per cent to 19 552.88 points.
The tech-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 per cent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50 index, the leading index for the euro area, rose by 1.01 per cent to 3207.60 points.
The London and Paris trading venues also recorded solid profits.
In the United States, the Dow Jones index was up about 1 percent.
Many stock market traders expect the markets to be in place until after the US interest rate decision and the big drop in futures markets on Friday.
The discussion on the burden of nuclear disengagement has meanwhile pushed RWE's shares to a record low and left deep traces at Eon as well.
According to "Spiegel", German energy companies may be short of 30 billion euros in reserves.
The Federal Government denied the figures reported in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat afterwards, but ultimately lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares rose another 3.22 percent at the Dax peak.
According to one trader, a positive report from the U.S. investment magazine Barron's at the weekend had a knock-on effect.
The Commission also notes that the German chipmaker is not currently receiving enough attention from investors.
The investment in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
The demand for cars was high: even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The shares of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen trains increased in price by 1.26%.
On the German pension market, the yield on circulation of German stock exchange-listed securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) per cent.

The dollar was thus worth 0.8846 euros.
Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district's chief official, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
He said 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, appeared to produce such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces created under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been involved in violent clashes since the 10th.
The first was the death of a young man in August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centuries-long centrally governed.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Planned construction area in the city
The plot at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4,000-square-meter site.
A mix of trade, industry and housing is planned, but no concrete proposals are yet available.
Emden - The City of Emden is planning to sell a plot of approximately 4000 square metres in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations are under way.
The site is planned to be used for a mix of commercial, industrial and residential uses.
City officials say they're waiting for the right offers.
The investor in question is not yet clear.
The Commission also noted that no agreements had been concluded.
The City of Emden had already bought a part of the plot at the Ringstraße/Ecke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
Plans for a holiday home on the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
Many residents remain concerned - they fear their holiday home will be sold out
For months, negotiations, discussions, and drawings had been held behind closed doors.
Now plans are on the table for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time on Monday evening at the Urban Development Committee of the Emder Council.
The Commission has not yet decided on the matter.
Under pressure from project critics and the FDP group, who accused the investors and the administration of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the System-Bau management went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all the questions", he told the members of the council and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, which will cost between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The images and new details of the desired hotel building evoked fierce reactions among the seabird owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, owner of the Meerbud and a board member of the local association Pro Hieve, laments: "It will be a giant cluster that will outshine all other buildings".
He also fears, as do many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the planned size of the plant: "There must be whole busloads coming in to make this count", says Schulz.
What exactly is happening on the one-acre site of the former tavern is, however, still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we have to have a coherent concept", said Ralf Behrends.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of aid.
Twin offspring of gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is excited about the newborn gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twins are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, the zoo said.
The sex of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet known, as mother Dian has been holding them tightly to her body.

NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added Miami-based weather experts.
Google launches a double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling of donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the fundraiser on their blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey involved many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donation of up to $5.5 million on google.com/refugeerequires to be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For people with mildly overweight diabetes, weight-loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is too early to say whether mildly obese people with diabetes will live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show anything", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight-loss surgery who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery, or obesity surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done on people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI of over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they had collected in a study since 2007 to compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric bypass - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI of those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained about the same at 29 for those receiving nonsurgical diabetes treatments.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had completely and 28% had partially resolved their diabetes.
In the medically treated group, only about one percent of the patients had complete and partial diabetes, compared with about two percent.
In addition, results on blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
The best way to keep hemoglobin A1c below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the medically treated group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels - did not reduce mortality within five years, said lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared with the gastrectomy group, achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to have completely overcome diabetes (46.9 vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who had obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years than a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study, because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group", without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to get people to take this seriously", she said.
I think once they've accumulated those genetic changes that have tied their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse".
Love story is playing out in Hunsrück
It is a subject that is currently receiving increasing attention in the literary world: a young woman, unpopular and unattractive in school, meets the man of her youth again after years, and he falls in love with her.
So, too, in the recently published novel "We Are Not Really Like This" by Luisa Binder.
The novel is of interest to readers from Hunsrück, especially those who are interested in the love story, as it is set in Borweiler and the surrounding villages.
The full-time writer grew up in Boring and is happy to have been able to put a literary monument in her hometown.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the refugees' home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethical studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable but not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in managing the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how to create real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries", he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the violent response of the United States followed a chain of events that were uncontrollable.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush, telling him that the way to solve this problem is non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and it has had unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Quadrupling of children's hand sanitizer intake in the last four years
Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400-percent increase in children under the age of 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of children under 12 who used hand sanitizers, as reported by poison control centers, rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more and more of these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectants on purpose, while others do it to impress their friends or because of a social media test.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectants just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to make a tougher drink.
Younger children may be attracted by the attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for him", Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with the scent of strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, even a few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol", Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
Now, you wouldn't leave a sip of whiskey standing around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children get to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice the legal drinking level for an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah listened to her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary", Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizers out of the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspected that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, instead of the ethyl alcohol listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in New York State planned to poison their "ordinary" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom", reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished her from her room.
The police considered the foiled plan "gossip" and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a road accident at the intersection between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving at the intersection in the direction of the industrial zone and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped in the intersection.
He then crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed that vehicle against a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The vehicles involved in the accident caused property damage of about 10 000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed.
Rumor has it there's no disharmony at Celtic.
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits the Hoops are in a bad spot, but that he'll turn it around.

Dons increase Celtic's lead to five points
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, leaving the Dons five points clear of Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk of disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates were not under increased control as they were preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader.
I don't think we're feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands national team player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't here.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what she's interested in.
There's a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'm going to turn things around, I swear to Deila.
Ronnie Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat to Malmö and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League, the defeat to 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with a five-point lead.
But Deila said, "Celtic have had bad times before, and we'll come back".
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes the players better.
It's so important to stand together now.
Warburton careful with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which suggested he was hinting at some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new signings and insists he doesn't want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
The players who come in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal order
Swansea striker Michu, who has been in contact with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued by a troublesome ankle for two years and has failed to make the departure from Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle because of Nelson's comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2, but the defender's red card was later revoked - Collum's third red card revoked in eight months.
Neilson keeps his word, insisting: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance".
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The unrepentant Hibee was reprimanded after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment", said the striker, adding: "It is safe to say that I will not return to Tynecastle if it is not playing for Celtic Glasgow".
The Tannadice Board has confidence in the Dundee United management.
Simon Donnelly insists that the Dundee United board still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but concedes that the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get the boys back on track", Donnelly said.
McInnes was happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits his Aberdeen side had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win, which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's half-time eleven.
McInnes said, "There's no team that's won everything, in cups or leagues, that hasn't won games of this kind".
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in the May-July period, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, at 5.9%, was higher than the UK's unemployment rate of 5.5%, as shown by figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of persons employed now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% during the quarter - above the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy".
It's almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In the last 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk people interrupted the flow
Security personnel were unable to calm the situation, so the employees called the police.
Only the use of pepper spray enabled the authorities to arrest the troublemakers.

Why I'm gonna be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a late legal intervention, I'm going to watch a man be put to death.
If it does, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in a viewing gallery in the death chamber of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made in January by his best friend, and though I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So, why would I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It's true that journalists are allowed to watch executions in the United States, and because there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery is held to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media locations from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it emotionally.
I can't do this.
I'm gonna be sitting next to Richard Glossip's best friend, with whom I've developed my own relationship over the months through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like this guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you get access.
I complain to her.
She admitted that she "could have put it better", but she still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could take me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks the publicity campaign will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go into all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a party to the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm gonna watch him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact.
What you're going to get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.
Man after wet police chase persuades to come out of Canning River
The Canning Vale cop stayed dry while he talked the man from Canning River.
An attempt by a Perth man to call off the police failed when he found himself in the shallow, swampy water, just a few yards from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to shore".
Canning Vale Police were called Tuesday to a breach of the peace in Beckenham.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He was standing in the water and said, 'I can't get out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good cop negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape", said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Champion soccer player Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousin drove his car into the ditch to evade a liquor check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but he inspired local residents to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he's always tried to do what's best for racing and he found himself in difficult circumstances when it came to the positive cobalt dust sample on Lidaris, which he can't explain.
He had held back for 18 months over the espionage charges and didn't want it to "look like too many grapes".
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once", Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk around with my head held high, and I want my owners to think that I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I'm not doing this, then I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Moody had previously set off the bomb in an interview with racing.com, saying the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
You obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, surely they should be holding their noses, for they failed in their attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are aware today.
Is that supposed to make me feel like it's getting personal?
Has the RVL been cowardly, perhaps blaming people outside of trainers for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
They may have to take my license and fire me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying is going to make her think about it now.
But I've gotten to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation into Lidari, and the Late Scratching led him to say that he could "throw his license over the table".
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses' legs, in violation of the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that", he said.
"One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which it was.
It was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for handling the pack on race day.
It's a joke, you know.
People who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all realize we need rules, but this is where it's gone too far", Moody said.
Man arrested for hit and run
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent hit-and-run in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley motorway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to Shepparton police.
He's expected to face charges of carjacking and negligent driving and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is hitting back against rivals over ring fights allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favourites from the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm players to "ring fights" with his team during the high-profile Storm victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a scarcely veiled comment about the Storm team after his team won the final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model" of rugby league and saying the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling, saying that they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of his team from two top coaches makes him feel confident, as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us 24:2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven't changed anything about our defensive system or our techniques all year, but over the last six weeks, we've made our contact with tackles a real focus, and that's been the game-changer for us.
Trent's been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this keeps popping up at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he'd take care of the shit out of it.
But now he's got a team that can play and we think it's exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have that kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football -- not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
I'm building a stronger trust because they're saying these things because they're a little bit worried about playing against us.
I don't think they thought about us six weeks ago when they were talking about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against the Roosters scored higher than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I haven't watched it, but what was the score? 16 to 12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or is taking breaks and not scoring something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means we're going to run into them at some point.
The Storm team is off this weekend, having won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the AAMI Park pre-season, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $ 200,000 bail on drug charges
A man facing life in prison for attempting to smuggle 40 kilograms of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse Café, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was trying to possess the entire quantity and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The Supreme Court Justice, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the possibility of Maksimovic's escape.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
The crime was that he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $200,000 bail bond to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security deposit is a real financial burden", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and abide by a curfew from 6pm to 6am.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: the driver's cab is torn apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a road accident involving three trucks on the Karlsruhe Highway 5 on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment, police said.
The driver's cabin of the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for over six hours until 2 a.m.
The damage was EUR 122,000.
Stevan Hogg used girls' phones to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service, which sent him a series of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked it over, found the confusing reports and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them".
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he was the one who did the searches, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendant about it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the charge of taking indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breaching the terms of 25 January this year and failing to appear for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be placed on the sex offender registry, arguing that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the sentencing until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody pending further hearings.
He was put on the sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
Smugglers are moving to small border crossings into Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up outside the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers, fearing detection and arrest, increasingly left people at smaller border crossings
"The Austrian side of the border", said a spokesman for the Federal Police.
More than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn River in Passau and Rottal-Inn counties since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and embankments.
There they are picked up by federal police officers and sent for registration.
According to the Federal Police, more refugees arrived at the Munich central station on Wednesday than at the beginning of the week.
By 8 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the state capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1,759 refugees had arrived in the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Tropical storm "Henry" expected to break out in the southwest
Meteorologists are warning of storm surges in the southwest beginning Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart reported.
The strong low is the trigger of Tropical Storm Henry, which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Strong storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to DWD, there are still 60 to 90 kilometres per hour of high winds to be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance area until Thursday morning.
So on Friday, the sun will be out again for longer.
Every two years, the carmakers show their new products at the International Motor Show.
In 2015, the main trend was for compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars in the compact class are currently in particular demand: according to the Federal Motor Vehicle Administration (KBA), around 28.1 per cent of new registrations in August alone were in this segment.
This is reflected at the IAA (Public Days, 17-27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept vehicles and new luxury and premium cars, this year will see the introduction of many new compact models.
One of the biggest debuts for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be on sale in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us", said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the trade fair.
He's the core of the brand.
The new Astra is not expected to be much more expensive to sell the volume model.
Opel is looking at a start below its biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at €17,650.
The current Astra is priced from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hesse is offering other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, including for the first time three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike its main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the Combi, which is also on display at the IAA.
And what else is being shown at the IAA, besides the Astra, on new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the show, the Mégane will be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and a highly sporty GT version.
It'll be on sale early next year, then as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The newest in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan subsidiary wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits perfectly into the brand's design line.
The base model will be equipped with a petrol engine with a power output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, a diesel engine with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno is also new in the segment, celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque according to the manufacturer is 170 Newton metres (Nm).
Sales of the Baleno in Europe will start in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely updated, is the compact class model DS 4 on display at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the luxury Citroën rack have focused on the front: the grille has been redesigned and the modified headlights have been equipped with LED technology.
The interior has been modernized, particularly the infotainment system, the number of buttons has been reduced by a touchscreen and Apple's CarPlay has been integrated for the first time.
In addition, the compact class will be joined at the IAA by a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are undignified
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favour of an ex-convict from the Tegel correctional facility who was kept in a too-small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are kept in cells that are too small.
The Federal Constitutional Court ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the victims can hope for money even if they were confined in the too narrow rooms for only a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This was the success of an ex-convict's constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was held in a single cell with a floor area of about five square metres in the Berlin-Tegel correctional facility between June and November 2009; the toilet was not separated from the room.
The man, who according to his lawyer is now free, was then moved to a larger cell.
His civil action against the Land of Berlin for the undignified conditions of his detention failed.
But the Constitutional Court overturned the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and sent the case back to the Chamber for further consideration.
They see the man's dignity violated.
The Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
It was also stated that even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of the period in question were relevant for compensation, there was a claim for compensation.
Otherwise, "a violation of the legal protection of personality would be to be feared".
The district court must now determine the amount of the monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
It was not until April that they awarded damages to a prisoner for being locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also considered inhuman.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified an inhuman accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The applicant at the time was kept for between 15 and 21 hours a day for over three months in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of staff shortages.
Prisoners are kept locked up for 23 hours, the aggression increases, even fights are said to have occurred because of the tense situation.
According to the information of the judicial press office, 21 positions are not filled in Tegel due to the lack of new recruits, 19 are to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's happening to Germany?
The Federal Ministry of the Interior forecasts that around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, while Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) says that Germany is even capable of receiving one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown her determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we will do it".
The following summary gives an overview of what Germany will face.
According to various forecasts, between 350,000 (estimation by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimation by the Pestel Institute) dwellings will be used each year - for the next five years.
This is almost double the amount of housing that has been built so far (250000 dwellings).
The shortage of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental properties: every year, between 60000 and 80000 social housing units are excluded from the rental price fixing, and refugees are also applying for these particularly affordable housing units.
The Federal Minister for Construction, Barbara Hendricks (SPD), wants to double the funding from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
The Pestel Institute considers that this is far too little: 80 000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the Federal Government would have to invest 6.4 billion a year in this.
The Federal Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and scientists agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Vocational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany are expected to be employed in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But the key to the integration of refugees is whether they find work in Germany.
The study, which was published in the journal Science, shows that the number of people who are unemployed is increasing.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn from the ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While previously a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years was reduced to three months in November 2014, so was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
The majority of society, also because of the shortage of skilled workers, has adopted the view that refugees should be given quicker access to the labour market.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is lack of knowledge of German.
There is still a lack of general and vocational language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often provided through personal contacts.
The creation of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt's view, the royal road to integration into the workforce.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in the kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of the nursery, however, the administration distributes leaflets in various languages.
If the need for female teachers increases sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more vocational schools.
In the countries, pupils without German language skills are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
They are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state forbids asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception was Berlin, but Interior Minister Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Refugees who want to study could be facilitated in their access to higher education.
Because refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start a study.
The latter are not entitled to a Bafög in principle, since they do not fall within the category of persons entitled to a Bafög.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, but this period will be reduced to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
But this funding gap must also be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Association.
The students should get their bafög right away.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as churches and develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It is also important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that will take care of the newcomers professionally.
Among the rights are duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact points and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant it certain controls.
This includes a willingness to stand firm against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to wage such conflicts in Germany "have immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany", he told the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested that the Basic Law be translated into Arabic.
Integration will be a matter for society as a whole in the future, much more than it is today.
The majority society will also have to change, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
The Commission has also been involved in the implementation of the European Social Fund, which is a key instrument for the European Social Fund.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, where the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and non-white German interest groups have long demanded and to which international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention have committed Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the good of all.
Germany is generally able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as manpower and capacity are concerned, we can do it", he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, this would require additional money to flow into the system.
To avoid traffic jams, Montgomery is asking all arrivals to hand out health cards as soon as they register.
The benefits could be later settled with the Länder.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided for in the Asylum Seekers' Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the language barrier is the main problem for doctors.
Already, as Berlin-based health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctors' offices, interpreters' fees should be borne, she demands.
But many refugees would be helped by more general medical services in emergency departments.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, refugee children are much more likely to be left untreated, and young people are more likely to be educated about HIV.
German doctors, though, were able to cope with the partially different disease patterns, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infestations or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect", and as for the shortage of doctors, relief may even be in sight through the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some of the refugees are even doctors.
However, to be admitted to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take further examinations.
According to estimates by the German Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
The most vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany traumatized.
People with post-traumatic stress disorder experience what are called flashbacks, including shortness of breath, dizziness, heartburn, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, severe fear, and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
However, so far only four per cent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although asylum seekers with mental illness can apply for psychotherapy at social services, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in most social services, counselors or doctors who are not trained in the treatment of mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new production "Passion", the Circus Probst is drawing on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to capture the fascination of every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus invites Probst to dream in the bar on the brick wash.
"Our passion is the circus".
"I can't imagine living without my circus family", says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior director.
"Passion" - this is the motto of the current man-made production.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the family.
"It's important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours", stresses the 27-year-old junior manager.
"Manege cocktail with world-class flair", is what Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus is convincing with talented artists from all over the world.
The Russian Stoliarov Clown Family, which won the prestigious international circus festival in Monte Carlo, captivates audiences with its wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers know their craft, too.
The Cuban duo is trying to take it easy with the heroes of silent movies.
Lightness and agility - these are the words they identify with.
Your humorous art at the mast is supposed to win women's hearts in the storm.
Besides numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with finger-point sensitivity and jointiness.
Balancing with the unicycle on a bullet?
He Yuan is fine.
Snake people are fascinating and frightening at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family", stresses Stephany's mother, Brigitte Probst.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of animals kept in the wild.
Stephanie Probst also comments: "If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well".
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read off their eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal is not comfortable, it will not want to go to the bar.
So the first commandment is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a cross between a Shetland pony and a zebra mare.
The two animals have been living together in a cage for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, all of a sudden, our little Jumbo was here", says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is for sure", says Stephanie Probst, "whether it's five people or 1,200, we're always doing our best and we're doing it with our whole heart".
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, and the 5 p.m. show is at a discount.
The zoo is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe gives a false speech in the parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but the video of the crash quickly went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with booing.
Last month they had him outraged and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in Parliament - which is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to disturb Mr Mugabe's speech.
"The message is coming from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death'", he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that their immunity in Parliament is ending and that once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in its services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, separating its computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and services business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of more than $2.7 billion beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business", said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for enterprises", according to a company statement.
It's a division of a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment, and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to deal with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in the field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strong after a separate ankle injury and then had regained his old momentum during the preseason.
"This kind of injury is not a career threat", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn't related to his ankles or any of the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger acknowledged, there is the inherent risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It's also developing an uncomfortable pattern.
The Premier Injuries Ltd investigation has recorded 23 different illnesses involving Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
The bigger picture for Arsenal is that in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to have the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in injury rates will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm confident he will and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal will start their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is setting up a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little respite", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense", said Wenger.
It's never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I've been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open up has become more desperate than ever, as young men's suicide rates are at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends who were "in a healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media-driven communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, vibrant and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of intrinsic values -- our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as one video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned that focus on the upside down.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
Joey and Chandler's humor, their frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy chairs, and Ross's longing for Rachel - all came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to that, even if they often hold back from fully exploring their feelings.
As one telephone operator explained to me, "my listening role for people who are feeling depressed and suicidal has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference".
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old adage "I can handle it" has a tremendous effect, as does the feeling that it is perceived as weakness to talk openly about problems".
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It's a very clear representation of the little moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you're going to Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the whole newly redesigned stage to celebrate the day, why don't you take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see someone sitting alone at Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship might make.
Friends will be aired on Comedy Central from start to finish - the total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria hits to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria is hitting his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helping PSG to get past Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held their course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player, which launched the French champions, but they then missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they are not only aiming for qualification for the knockout rounds, but for an improvement on their way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they were getting the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missing chances in front of the goal. He was later traded in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0 and to cause problems for our opponents and to look back in a relaxed way, even if there are certain things we still need to improve over the course of the season", Blanc said.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score another goal or two".
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which managed to hold a 2-2 home draw against Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but he was sent off by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was touted as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was snapped up by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why when he walked into Marco Verratti's pass behind the Malmö defense before passing Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that stage, entered at Anpiff with nine national players on the field and were lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in midfield a tough opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, which passed far past Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some misses and poor finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who batted in no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then was dropped after Cavani used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a spin shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was conceded a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough".
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game they played!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by plummeting commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale Wednesday as part of its massive debt-repayment plan.
Glencore, a London-based company, said in a statement that it had sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn depresses demand and devastates markets.
The issue of quotas brought Glencore's share price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced last week the $2.5 billion share sale as part of a broader plan to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125 pence a share, a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
It issued 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, and prices of coal, copper and other commodities have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people, after a long flight, reached the city hall in Weimar.
The refugees are from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will take place on September 25 and is in response to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner that evening, after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement", the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before traveling to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and its growing confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill his dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
Then, on the rainy highway, the evil awakening came.
At a company in the Gotha district, you can fulfill your dream and once rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was the case with a 29-year-old man from Gotha County.
On the A71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, hit a slide on wet track and crashed into the dashboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was hurt.
The damage to property is estimated at EUR 40 000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented him from joining Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern were obviously on the verge of the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time Cup winner, four-time Champions League winner, two-time club world champion, two-time European champion, one-time world champion - Xavi's list of titles is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi reveals that he was ready to leave Barcelona before the Euro 2008.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me".
"Madrid won everything, we won nothing", he says.
And that's what FC Bayern recorded.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria".
Rummigge wanted me.
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch
The change did not take place.
And the man who did it is now working for the German record holder, Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great World Cup".
"Pep told me I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me".
"That's what he got me with".
Who knows what Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have been like with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, knocked out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king-class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO's Sunday Night with Project Greenlight, veteran actor Brown interrupted her as she stressed the need for alternative perspectives, in terms of a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"If we're talking about diversity, you do it in the casting of the movie, not the casting of the show", Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, with insulted disbelief, and shouted "hoo! wow. okay", as the comments from the actor of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about - whoever the director is - how they treat the figure of Harmony", Brown said at first.
The only black person, and she's a hooker being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People lobbied for the film's directing rights for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded that their directing "may end up giving us something we don't want".
After the discussion aired, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WHITE it hurts".
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon's comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement made a nationwide impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have issued a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck's question of whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter network is a charity", the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
American Ninja Warrior is crowned first champion
Professional sports climber and assistant operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the grand prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which had just completed its seventh season, had never seen a competitor complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the finals.
The final task was to climb a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero completed this challenge three full seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still in shock over winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never made or had more than $10,000 in my life", Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
So suddenly... as I can't even imagine what it's like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, despite finishing first in the run, doesn't get any prize money.
The rules say the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there's more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it", Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life-changing, he receives the great gratification.
I don't think he's holding any grudges about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He got a lot of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I'm going to be hit by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking by the Minnesota Twins
The second half of the season hasn't been much fun for the Detroit Tigers.
They used to be one of the best teams in baseball, and now the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but they played that role perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins, 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to advance within one-half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, even if it was just for one night, it was a return to the three-letter F word that was so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter what", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit six in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong", Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that's why I want to go into the game with all my focus.
Tiger designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He's swinging the bat very well", Ausmus said.
He looked good in the (strike training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the bottom of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double off the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a home run, and Simon brought second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout position before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy outscored Mauer, the only man he faced, before designated rookie hitter Miguel Sano, who struck out right-hander Drew Verhagen with a two-run home run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play, leading the majors.
After Detroit added an insurance run in the bottom of the ninth inning, Mauer hit an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck out Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit opened the game with a Phil Hughes that hadn't moved yet.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been sidelined prior to the game after missing more than a month with a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to make some pretty good pitches in the third inning".
After they got the leadoff hitter in the first, Hushes gave a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who managed a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 win streak with the runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was ejected as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers scored in the second, a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't do very well, but he got the right job.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was sidelined with a shoulder injury.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who's been on injured reserve since mid-August with a shoulder injury, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday's start.
With Sanchez out, LHP Daniel Morris is being cut from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in a trade with LHP David Price on July 30
He's been out since August 20th with a torn right hip.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) is going to play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be sheltered in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for Wednesday night.
The people who were in the plane will then be housed in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, the city of Wiesbaden said Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls in the Hessian capital had been prepared for this event in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily housed there.
They are then to be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office responsible for initial admission in Giessen, 7500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive consideration of military options should not take place without Germany", he said.
He accused the European states of "collective vision".
Four years ago, we were happy that the chalice of military involvement in Germany had passed.
"Now the conflict is crashing at our doorstep", he told Germany Radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced checks at its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one is being sent back to Hungary.
Germany has also not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's the deal", she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give any specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
They're mostly going to Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, have requested a special summit next week.
Germany had started temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's interior ministers are to take a fresh approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (22 September).
In view of the high number of refugees in Germany, the Federal Government intends to give the Länder greater support in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The Federal Government will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late on Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of workers' rights.
But if you have no prospect of staying, you cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared during the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to make a "huge effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stranded on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres (175 miles) border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania.
This neighbouring country is not part of the EU like Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes through Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said of the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
Meanwhile, in Turkey, thousands more migrants were reportedly making their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on the moon Enceladus
Beneath the icy shield of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean is swirling.
This is the conclusion reached by researchers from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon is slightly wobbling in its orbit around the ring planet.
This tapered movement is small, but too large for a continuously stationary celestial body, says a report from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, U.S.A., published Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles that feed Saturn's E-ring.
At least at the South Pole, there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not known.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich several weeks
1860 Munich will have to give up their offensive player Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munich's Löwen, the diagnosis "is expected to mean a four-week forced break".
"This is a great loss for us, Rama".
"Of course we have to think now", sports director Necat Aygün told Bild newspaper, referring to the possible commitment of a professional without a club.
But the Sixties first introduced a defensive man as a training guest.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was most recently active in Belgium and was previously also signed by VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has "the opportunity to prove his skills".
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie is back in training next week after suffering a concussion.
The Austrian national team player is scheduled to start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in the game against Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a violent collision.
Despite initial fears, he was not seriously injured.
No diet fruits - mangoes are high in sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to keep your skin thin, you're often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy, containing vitamins B, E, and C. But especially mangoes are rich in vitamin A and its precursor, beta-carotene.
Thus, those who eat the fruit support the body's vision, immune system, and metabolic processes.
When buying mangoes, do not make them too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The color of the shell alone does not tell us how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very good.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they naturally taste pure or in sweet foods.
But a mango also adds a special flavor to hearty dishes.
It soothes the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads, such as chicory and radiccio.
And a mango chutney is good for fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is re-hiring up to 95,000 people for its Christmas business in the US.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
They're looking for drivers.
Last year, UPS had already increased its holiday workforce by 95,000.
In light of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making early preparations for Christmas sales since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries had attracted harsh criticism from parcel services.
First the storm, then the cold front
The next night, the Föhn will break through the valleys of the northern side of the Alps, Meteoschweiz announced Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night, the wind blows through the valleys with some force.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, gusty winds and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews reports, Switzerland is currently on the front of a large low pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwest current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the fountain breaks through the valleys on Wednesday night.
The winds then blow in the valleys of the Föhnen valleys at 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland, sometimes at over 100 km/h.
The hail can sometimes reach the adjacent central country, and in the mountains even hurricanes of over 120 km/h are possible.
While stormy winds in the north on Wednesday bring summer temperatures of between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C] [27°F], the humidity on the Alpine slopes is beginning to build up.
Here it's going to rain, and it's going to last until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps, some of the rainfall is expected to exceed 100 litres per square metre in the next 48 hours, after heavy rainfall in recent days.
On Thursday morning, the air is exhausted, and a cold front with heavy, sometimes torrential, rain from west to east rolls over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the winds are strong and stormy, and temperatures are falling significantly.
The following days are in the north, with 15 to 20 degrees in autumn, while in the south, it is sunnier and warmer at the weekend, with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of the city's mayor, Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on Oppio Hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the Piazza Martin Luther, he is now honored as "German Theologian of the Reformation".
The park is in the middle of ancient Rome, right next to the Colosseum.
The name change had been requested by the Working Party of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the popes were often a minority and could only practice their faith in secret for centuries.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt that the city was a wicked Babylon of sin.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome, according to historians.
Luther's theses against indulgences had then led to the split in the Western Church.
Hammer Künstler invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golded) crown of thorns is one of the main works painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now been published with beautiful illustrations.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" of colorful shapes and imaginative forms has been preserved by the 75-year-old - but this is not the same as "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, it can be quite gloomy when adapted to the subject.
For about three years, Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have been created that focus on such topics as the way of the cross, plagues, commandments, or the Lord's Prayer.
This has attracted several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the Bible passages in question on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into the present, into current contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of ancient painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each of the artist's sentences, each expressing his very personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewelry ribbon has gold lettering.
This allows the 75-year-old to double-check his soul, his emotions.
That's a lot of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strictly Protestant Herrnhuter order.
"There was a time when education was done with a cane", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've been trying to work it out, "so I can get back with Mr. Father".
His second concern is to help art to regain its importance in the near future: "The perception of images is now dominated by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolicity is being displaced.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Pictures are always mysterious and not decorative.
"In that respect, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to "fall in" with the images, to let them affect him, to discover and feel the power they have: "The image seeks its counterpart".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation that he has "always" been a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like the way he understands life with his pictures".
Alt did not care to grasp the Bible completely, but chose the subjects that were important to him, even those that were mysterious.
"It was not a collaboration at eye level", says Altepost. "It was about the pictures, the text simply explains".
For Hans Möhler of Luther Publishing, this work is an invitation "to deepen one's life and to find freedom".
Otmar Alt's paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening at the Otmar Alt Foundation on 15 November.
Construction of BMX train to begin
Plans were made, space was found, companies were hired, hills were modeled for a circuit: A year later, almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BMX track, it was over.
Failures in policy and administration caused distress, especially among the local people, who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So we moved hills, found a new site - now with formal planning and a building permit application.
The approval will be received in October, the first local councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock told the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year something more visible will happen", she said.
The work on the former hall bath was to begin without "any further commemorative work".
DFB intensifies its commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is making a clear sign this weekend.
Football is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and is helping the politicians to cope with the problems ahead.
"I consider this the greatest challenge our country has faced since reunification".
"In principle, no one can say, 'It's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.'"
"Everyone has to be interested in getting a handle on this issue", said DFB head Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
"I'll be in the Chancellery next Wednesday and meet with Minister of State Mrs. Özoğuz and the Chancellor".
"The issue will certainly play a central role", he announced.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive decisions must be made by the political parties.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its "1:0 for a welcome" refugee initiative for four years.
"Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019", Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's/Malta.
Some of the Bundesliga players also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will make a clear sign by wearing the inscription "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can", Leverkusen's sports director Rudi Völler told Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama is everyone's business, no one should look the other way".
"We football fans can, no, we have to use our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly", said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's managing director, Peter Rettig, spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
For the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday, the women's national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a great community project of German football".
It was great that all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their respective locations.
And what's also great is that there are small and very small clubs that are active there.
The message "One-O for a welcome" that we have issued is being lived in football.
"This is of tremendous importance", he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the full sum for 2015", Niersbach reported.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the staircase accident at his brother's home in the United States, he fell after midnight on a glass of water he was holding in his left hand, reported the Economist weekly on Wednesday.
"He was almost bleeding, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week", said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, quoted by WiWo.
McDermott can do his job.
"We will meet in early October before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf", said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully fit".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm all about SAP, all about my job".
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman, Hasso Plattner, all the time", McDermott told the "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the USA, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
He said it was important for him to go public with such a personal story, and the manager of the "SZ" said: "Anyone can have this".
"The important thing is to get up when you've fallen".
McLaren second-in-command Magnussen is out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted a photo of the victim, saying he suffered the injury when he fell off the bike.
He is therefore no more eligible to race in Singapore at the weekend than he is to be a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as he is a week later at the Japanese Grand Prix.
Football: BVB without a doubt against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally crumbled.
The national player will be absent from the leader of the football Bundesliga in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am / Sky).
"We cannot, unfortunately, rely on him", Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top-flight game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach revealed: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday".
Given the high pressure on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his pedigree in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller is taking the place of Roman Bürki, the keeper of the club.
"He's training at an absolutely top level", the soccer coach praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel did not say whether Weidenfeller would be used in all Europa League matches in the future.
He'll probably be in the second game, too.
The research statement of fellow player Reus that the final move for BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, considers midfielder Julian Weigl understandable: "Marco is not so wrong with that".
"I think we have a good chance of winning the title".
Robot cars: the government wants to lead Germany
Germany is to be the technological pioneer in the transformation of the car, according to the will of the Federal Government.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show about a "new era of mobility".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transport's strategy paper stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on the Bavarian motorway 9 to test new technology.
In order to avoid "additional liability risks" for the driver, the Federal Government intends to "review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to new developments".
For example, Germany is seeking to promote the international increase of the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The Federal Government also wants to work for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for human drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, the driver becoming more and more the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "are not expected until well after 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site is estimated by the authors of the study to be around EUR 8.4 billion in 2025.
"Digital car networking can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic", said Sören Bartol, SPD transport policy-maker.
The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
Yet, Germans are still skeptical of self-driving cars - far more so than Frenchmen or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute, commissioned by the research organization Dekra, and presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it in 20 years, and 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect self-driving cars by 2025, in the United States, 33 percent.
In any case, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to hand over control of all roads during the entire journey.
On the highway, you could imagine 15 percent in traffic, 45 percent in traffic jams.
One in four would never give up control of the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and doubles start at the European Table Tennis Championships
The current situation in Düsseldorf means that the title matches from 25 September to 4 October will be played in individual matches only.
The final decision is to be taken by 22 September at the latest.
"This is a huge loss for our team".
"The boys found out this morning".
"We are strong enough to win the title without Timo", said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championship training course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a flight to a long-term sponsorship meeting in China at the time.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
"Without Timo, the downside is that we are no longer such a clear favourite", explained European singles champion Dmitry Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"Then Timo was also missing, and we became European champions".
"That's what we should be guided by", explained the fifth-ranked player.
England international footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit during a tackling by Héctor Moreno and after a long treatment was replaced.
The initial diagnosis suggested that Bastian Schweinsteiger's 20-year-old teammate had a fractured shin.
Gaultier feels too old for a terrible child
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure-gruselka cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
Highlights: Dolls that appear terrifyingly human through video projections.
They're wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a major star in the fashion world with Madonna's stage outfits - and with putting men in skirts.
"I can't say I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture anymore because I have white hair".
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real", said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on view at the Hypo Culture Foundation's Art Hall from 18 September, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initial attitude from one of rejection to one of self-expression.
He was actually against it, because, he said, "An exhibition sounded a little bit like death to me".
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and Paris.
"It's so much more than just beautiful dresses", said the art gallery's director, Roger Diederen.
It's about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give a glimpse into the hardly-exhaustible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
The show is not chronologically structured, but it is a perfectly choreographed work of art for which a great deal of effort has been put in: for example, a stylist was hired to do the dolls.
14 tons of material were transported to Munich by the makers, according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Just before the start of the Oktoberfest, there was a special costume: a leather trouser outfit with corset.
Heidi is meeting Madonna.
He's always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy is on display, too.
It represents the designer's first tentative fashion attempts.
As a child (he wasn't a good student and bad at football), he wore his Teddy B-Shirts and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents wouldn't have let him play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at other designers' designs, as Gaultier told us in Munich.
But of course, I bought them later.
He couldn't afford the models for his first fashion show.
They didn't get anything, but they could keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plain top as a fashion niche
In the old days, the long knitting machines were all about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and spikes were produced in large quantities for customers, who processed them into, for example, ceilings and curtains.
This alone is no longer possible, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the fashion spike Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a bigger role, then was supplanted by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: top-notch jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past styles, is creating an increasing potential for orders.
If you are not in the textile industry in Germany, you are no longer on the market.
They're already half of our orders.
Modespitze Plauen is a member of the trade association Plauener Spitze und Embroidery together with nine other companies.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the sales have been lost.
Private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost gone.
Our products hardly reach the customer this way anymore.
The bulk goods are now produced much cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains.
Exports to Russia and the United States are also weakening.
So, enough reason to go new ways.
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality label which shows that we produce in an ecologically and socially sustainable way".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
The graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the West Saxony University of Applied Arts in Zwickau, and specializes in embroidery and spikes.
To compete with the Asian market, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
A tension is created between the freshest ideas of designers and companies that must think economically first", says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly modified to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball top.
The machine stitches small balls in some places.
The Plauen goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I could do nothing with traditional Plauen spikes".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, she embroidered the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old", says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in and around Plauen and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen peak.
Disney is planning a new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends are not to be touched, but Disney is still daring to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, the film is not a remake, but a sequel, set 20 years after the first film, with the magical nanny.
It's about the nanny's experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is Rob Marshall, most recently with Into the Woods in theaters.
Xi urges opening up the economy to the world
The economy must open up more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering reform on Tuesday.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies", he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Fostering innovation and pushing for reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and open up new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Leadership Group adopted a number of directives, including a negative list on market access, relaxation of border control policies, promotion of SOEs, private capital and overhaul of the resident reporting system.
The statement will be followed by a negative list identifying sectors and enterprises not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by means of test programmes.
The initiative is important as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a rule of law business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls over the powers conferred on enterprises and ensure that enterprises decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to make a decision on the financing of the project.
"The government will not change its foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide better services to them", the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the Green Card by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process.
The right to guarantee lawyers the right to practise their profession and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU to double mercury limit in predatory fisheries
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby providing consumers with a much higher dose of the nerve agent.
The EU consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a working paper on the matter, sharply criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of poor industrial and environmental policies are being passed on with full force to pregnant women and young children", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt said that the limit values for nerve toxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks and swordfish, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the fisheries sector is not affected by the current situation.
After doubling the thresholds, only 14.5 percent would remain unsold.
In return for this relaxation, Foodwatch says the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller fish, such as carp, are usually so low in load that they already meet the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small-scale fisheries is therefore "a perfidious diversionary maneuver which only helps the economy", Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal to humans, which is highly enriched in the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the unborn".
However, the Federal Ministry of the Environment states on its website that, with regard to the maximum values in force, a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the combustion of coal.
According to a written report from the Federal Environment Ministry to the Green Party Member of Parliament, Annalena Baerbock, German coal-fired power stations emit more than six tonnes of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The mercury concentration in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanently and extensively exceeded", the newspaper Spiegel quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings for mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU RASFF warning system.
