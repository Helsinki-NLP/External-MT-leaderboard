Fire extinguished at French chemical plant
The fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is considered to be particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the prefecture of Normandy announced on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was deployed with about 200 firefighting vehicles.
The fire was brought to a halt
The French government has ordered residents to stay inside their homes, evacuated buildings within 500 metres of the site, and closed schools and kindergartens on Thursday, and shut down a chemical plant on the banks of the Seine that produces additives for lubricants, owned by US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol company and subject to the EU's Seveso directive, which requires extra security measures.
The plant employs about 400 people. The chemical plant has already made headlines in the past - for example, when methantil gas leaked in 2013 and the environment smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after a plant accident, about 2,000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Woman quits her job to search for her missing dog for 57 days
A Washington woman spent two months looking for her missing dog, and she quit her job to do it. Her seven-year-old Border Collie ran away from her hotel room while on vacation in Montana. For 57 days, there was no trace of her, but Carole King never gave up.
"It was terrible. I felt nauseous", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake. She and her husband had left Katie, the dog, in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie had disappeared. They searched for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had panicked Dog
Hoping that Katie might still be at the hotel, Carole King went to the front desk. "The clerk says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalled to "Daily Inter Lake".
"I never gave up, I never lost hope", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears were flowing"
57 days after Katie's disappearance, Carole King received a call: a man called in saying that Katie was in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie had already disappeared. She was searching the neighborhood, and suddenly her dog was under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled loudly, "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. People stopped in their cars, hugged and hugged us. I think the whole neighborhood knew we had found her".
German losses: machine guns disappear without a trace
The Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision.
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition.
Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapon parts and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition. This is evident from a classified list of the Federal Ministry of Defense, which is reported by the editorial network Germany.
According to the paper from the office of the Secretary of State for Defence Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, a part of a weapon and 3474 rounds of ammunition have so far been recovered.
The extent of the loss of weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "terrifying", said the Left Bundestag member Martina Renner. This was all the more so because little was found during the investigation. The Left politician spoke of a "tiring balance". Renner criticized that the list did not show whether the missing ammunition included the one found in connection with the investigation against the suspected terrorist, the Bundeswehr officer Franco A. "Although a supporter of Franco A. was recently convicted for the possession of this ammunition", said Renner.
The oil tanker "Stena Impero" has left Iranian port
More than two months after its seizure by Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas today, Friday, according to ship-tracking data from Refinitiv, the tanker started moving and left the Iranian port, which was designated as Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the time being, the company said, pending an official announcement from Tehran.
The Stena Impero was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July, accused of violating security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was reacting to the controversial temporary detention of an Iranian oil tanker off the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important waterways. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of global oil exports is shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have intensified in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
Merkel praises the courage of the people in the Peaceful Revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has paid tribute to the commitment of the people of the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago in the Peaceful Revolution. In the autumn of 1989, courageous citizens shook the then GDR regime, Merkel said at a celebration of the Thüringen CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi headquarters.
Musk is aiming for the delivery record.
Tesla's quarter may be a record, but despite a delivery boom, the electric car company recently suffered losses.
New York.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a big boost on the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
"Demand is so strong that Tesla could book 110,000 orders", Musk's circular continued, "The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and to do that, Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter".
Investors loved it: Tesla's shares went up more than six percent, the biggest increase in nearly four months, and in the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, its highest ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be obtained in the current and next quarter. The cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't tickle ourselves
A kind of brake in the cerebrum prevents people from tickling themselves, scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found out on Thursday night, using experiments on rats, and they also made progress on the question of why children fight tickling so hard, only to ask for more.
Finally, it has also been shown why the mere approach of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before the touch. This is due to a deep-seated layer in the cerebellum, which triggers laughter already in the expectation of the tickle.
The data showed that previous research showed that rats react with "laughter" in the ultrasonic range when tickled by humans.This "laughter" is conveyed by the part of the cerebral cortex that is central to the processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed during self-touching
The researchers had previously assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-touch and touch by others - hence why people cannot tickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers now found in experiments on rats that laughter as well as the activity of the corresponding area of the cerebral cortex during self-touch is suppressed. This is also true when living creatures clean themselves. During the stranger's touch and tickling, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh were intensified by the scientists.
But if self-touch and other people's touches occur at the same time, laughter is suppressed, too, suggesting that the rat brain cannot distinguish between self-touch and other people's touches, and the new findings suggest that humans cannot self-tickle because self-touch activates a brake in the cerebellum.
The rats were also trained to tickle themselves, and sometimes failed to do so in the experiment, sometimes showing flight or fear, and the ambivalence was similar to that of children.
Averted catastrophe: major fire at French chemical plant extinguished
The fire at a chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which was considered particularly dangerous, has been extinguished, the Normandy prefecture told AFP news agency on Friday.
According to the authorities, no substances harmful to health have escaped, and the samples taken do not give cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 yards were evacuated, schools and kindergartens remained closed on Thursday.
The factory is owned by the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett .
The chemical plant on the banks of the Seine produces additives for lubricants.The plant is part of the US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol company and is subject to the EU's Seveso directive, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.Around 400 people work at the plant.
The chemical plant has been the subject of headlines in the past - for example, when in 2013 a leak leaked methanethiol gas and the surrounding area smelled of rotten eggs. In 2015, after an industrial accident, around 2000 liters of mineral oil flowed into the city's wastewater system.
Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting of Parliament after the lifting of the mandatory recess on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not comply with his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement. However, it is unclear how he intends to achieve this.
Speaking about Cox, who campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and to unite this country would be to leave the EU". Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
Memorials to Oslo and Utøya attacks are revealed
More than eight years after the Oslo and Utöya attacks, which left 77 dead, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The Iron Rose monument is made up of around 1,000 iron rosebushes, reminiscent of the roses laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks outside the cathedral in Oslo.
The project by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled in the same place - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and relatives of the victims.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik detonated a car bomb in the government district of Oslo, and then shot dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Workers' Party on the island of Utöya.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN General Debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict. But there is one less problem now. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran was able to go back to sea. It could be a piece of the puzzle in the peace plan of the Iranian President Rouhani.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been detained in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, has returned to international waters after being released by Iranian authorities and is on its way to Dubai, according to Stena Bulk.
The ship has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now on its way to Dubai for medical examinations, the company's chief executive Erik Hånell said.
The Foreign Office in London called the detention of the ship illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain shipping and international law", a statement said on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had detained the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating maritime law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had behaved professionally in the face of the difficult and frustrating situation over the past ten weeks. The shipping company is now working to reunite them with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that the arrest of the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in Gibraltar, where a super tanker with oil from Iran, allegedly destined for Syria, was chained in early July.
Iran called the attack "piracy" and threatened with consequences, and in mid-August the Adrian Darya-1 was finally released, although London vehemently denied that it was a barter deal to get the Stena Impero back.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important shipping lanes, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the strait. Tensions in the region have been escalating in recent months. Merchant shipping has been dragged into the conflict between the US and Iran. There have been several incidents involving tankers and drones.
The tensions between Tehran and Washington are the result of the nuclear dispute between the two countries. The Americans accuse the Iranian leadership of wanting to build nuclear weapons. Iran denies this. The USA in 2018 withdrew from the international nuclear agreement, which should have prevented Iran from building a nuclear bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to impose a stricter agreement and extended to other areas. Iran is resisting the pressure so far.
The Stena Impero dispute and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil installations in Saudi Arabia have prompted the US to work on a coalition to provide military protection for commercial vessels in the region.
The European Union is also calling on the Council to take action to ensure that the Gulf is a safe place for all citizens, and to ensure that the Gulf is a safe place for all citizens, including the citizens of the United States.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
In a UBS survey, financial executives of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country named India as one of the preferred alternatives. This is not only due to the uncertainties of the Sino-American trade war, of course, but also to the fact that India has a huge pool of young workers and a domestic market of 1.3 billion consumers, which seems to have created a more significant role in the global production chain.
But now India itself has become Trump's focus. Dismissing it as the "kingdom of tariffs" from the White House, America withdrew the emerging country's trade preferences for 2,000 products in early June. The US accuses India of excessively high tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
The trade war is a global issue, but the trade war with India is only a side issue. The US also looks at the world's largest democracy through the lens of security. Delhi and Washington share the concern about China's power in the southern Indian Ocean. Against this background, a wave of American punitive tariffs against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just begun his second five-year term, should therefore feel safe.
The problem lies elsewhere: the empirically-hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a hardship in the Socialist Republic of India, and also under Modi. His reformist zeal is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has stifled any entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-ethnic state for too long. Companies are now getting building permits faster. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankruptcy law creates conditions for liquidating companies that seemed to have high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic point of view, India has improved a lot in the first five years of the Modi era. But in trade policy this is not the case. Inspired by the need to protect companies that are not competitive internationally from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even erected new barriers.
In the West, Modi is the nimbo of the energetic reformer who radically renews his country's economy. This impression is due not least to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary pleases Western managers. But in essence, the "India First" advocate never backed down from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to get rid of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive thanks to the closure of their industries are among the tribe of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and applaud this short-lived policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac in Paris on Monday
The former French president Jacques Chirac will be buried in Paris next week, according to a report. The former head of state will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported, citing the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the close family circle. A public funeral service was scheduled for Sunday at the Invalidom in Paris, media reported.
Dabo is the first secret hero of the World Athletics Championships
The world top was already in the finish line when heartwarming scenes took place in the cooled down Khalifa International Stadium. In the first preliminary round of the men's 5000 metres, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to waver dangerously. He could hardly hold his legs 300 metres before the finish line, running in an unhealthy stance, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and dragged him into the final half of the stadium round. The forces were still enough to stop the goal run with the two running armbands. As if the scene had not been curious enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Anyone in this situation would have done the same", Dabo said after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. At first, he was shy, he did not want to talk about his heroism at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer. And anyway, he would only be proud to represent his country, which was invited to the WM by the World Cup. Under normal circumstances, he could not start. "That's why I should have been proud to run here for my country", he said.
He did it that evening with determination - and much more intensely than he would have expected. Because this feat will be remembered. Especially since Dabo even let his rival Busby take the lead in the finish and voluntarily took the last place - by the way, a good five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary. In the end, it was all for nothing, because Busby, who came to the finish line with only much help, was disqualified by the World Athletics Federation at the end.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studies in Lisbon, entered to set a personal best time at the World Championships in Doha. Although he succeeded with 18:10,87 minutes according to official data, he was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. I was under 18 minutes already". However, only in training, best times do not count.
Millions march: Egyptians prepare for a day of wild protests
In Egypt, security measures have been tightened ahead of possible anti-government protests, with police presence increased in central Cairo on Friday, several subway stations closed, and roads around central Tahrir Square blocked.
Police have stepped up their road checks and searched pedestrians' mobile phones for messages and photos related to the protests in recent days, and hundreds have been arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, hundreds of protesters in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura protested against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against the political leadership has not been seen in Egypt for years. The exiled Egyptian entrepreneur and actor Mohammed Ali, who has been promoting the protests on Facebook with video messages, called for a "million-marsch" in central places in the country for Friday. Ali calls for a "people's revolution".
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise, according to two observers: the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday, the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arbitrarily detained" "just because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers of those detained. The charges against those detained range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist group", according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, uniformed security forces, including those in civilian clothing, interrogated and searched by passers-by arbitrarily, HRW said.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country, saying that the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: easing the way for mail order retailers to donate returns
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, with some 20 million returns ending up in the trash.
The Treasury Department has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that while companies could not be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, in response to a question from the Green Party parliamentary group, which was reported by the newspapers of the Funke media group on Friday, traders could set the market value of unsold returns so low that they would have to pay no or little sales tax.
Scientists from the University of Bamberg had found that when ordering on the Internet, German citizens return every sixth package. Around four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - ended up in the garbage. To donate them would cost companies additional money under the current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate donations in kind as a turnover, which is then subject to sales tax.
Green party leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on the finance minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to issue a decree to clarify that companies can value non-marketable products accordingly and donate them free of charge to charitable organisations.
Banksy's art for sale: there's never been a better time to sell this painting.
The famous work of street-art star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is about to be auctioned.
Branczik said Banksy's work highlights "the return of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the animal and tribal way of life". The painting is due to be exhibited at Sotheby's in the British capital from Saturday until it is auctioned on 3 October.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives, and in that year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - coinciding with the original Brexit date of 29 March.
That painting could change hands for millions.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, calling on the Commission to take action to ensure that the situation in the former Yugoslavia is not further affected by the new situation in the former Yugoslavia.
This is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has become involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover, in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man who breaks a star of the European flag with a chisel. Thousands of truck drivers and other visitors see the work every day when entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's violent verbal attacks on anti-Brexit MPs do not contribute to a climate of hatred, his top adviser said. Compared to the campaign before the 2016 Brexit referendum, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings at a book launch on Friday. "We're enjoying this. We're going to leave (the EU) and we're going to win".
In the past few days, Johnson has attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament, accusing them of "treason" and of "humbug" accusations that he could put MPs in danger by threatening to kill them.
Cummings said the only way to bring back calm was for MPs to finally respect the British decision to leave the EU. It was no surprise that people were angry that Britain had still not left the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the heated atmosphere, even the bishops of the Church of England on Friday urged restraint. "We should speak with respect to one another", said a statement. "And we should listen".
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
In his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan made an emotional appeal to the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear powers Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said Friday at the UN General Assembly in New York. "If it goes badly, you hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations has a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this".
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them over the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers control a part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are calling for the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the current protests in Egypt with a heavy hand: it is shooting people with live ammunition, more than 2,000 prisoners are joining the 60,000 political prisoners already in prison. Protests have never been safe in Egypt. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus is doing everything to avoid a scenario like the Arab Spring.
But one of the things that triggered the 2011 protests was the poor economic situation, the poverty, the lack of prospects, the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government, which drove millions into the streets, and this is a problem that even the Sisi regime cannot control, no matter how hard it is against opponents, and the situation has actually worsened.
Today, one in three Egyptians live below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the repression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was already the case before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, and this is also an old dilemma in the supermarket. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have difficulty in affording a bottle of water.
BER chief: No more showstoppers for the capital's airport
The complex network of the BER fire protection system has been tested for two months to see if it works together, and the operators are satisfied with the way things have gone, but the TUV is not yet ready at the BER.
Following extensive Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators have confirmed the planned opening in October next year, Supervisory Board President Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control board.
The airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the check, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal to be worked out. "We have many details, but we do not have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule still contained buffers until the start of operations.
However, there are indications that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction completion notice is now to be submitted to the construction authority during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of electricity cable defects are still to be addressed, and Tüv is looking into them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of flight operations, work on the defects must continue intensively", a written communication said.
The airport manager said that in many cases it was a matter of lack of proof, not so much of new cables, nor of the approval of all the dubles on which the cable tracks are suspended.
The fire protection system at the station crossing under the terminal is not working satisfactorily. The problems had already led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke screens that close like a screen in case of fire so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines must therefore be replaced. Then there should be experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the new year.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, but fire safety problems, other structural deficiencies and planning errors have delayed its opening for years.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the airport authorities are planning to expand the airport.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Chief financial officer Heike Fölster will join Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has put the airport finances on a firm footing.
Chemnitz: Automatic drugs exploded - man arrested by police
He needed money for drugs and for that he blew up several vending machines in the Chemnitz area!
In the past two years, the number of exploded cigarette and parking machines in Chemnitz and the region has increased dramatically, causing a million-dollar damage!
After two explosions in late May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German man in the Bürgerstrasse and Further Street in Chemnitz.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the use of explosives in connection with a particularly serious case of theft, which was conducted by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, this suspicion was not the only one confirmed against the 33-year-old".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "He apparently financed his drug addiction with the loot". The bomber had blown up parking ticket machines on Bürgerstrasse four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage caused is at least 60 000 euros!
The suicide bomber is now in custody, and police are still investigating.
It is conceivable that he was also responsible for other machine-gun explosions in Chemnitz and surrounding counties.
AUA to take over Eurowings from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is changing its strategy for Vienna Airport. Amid price competition with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a spokesman for Austrian Airlines confirmed to APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa low-cost airline Eurowings will be de facto dissolved. Of the currently seven Eurowings aircraft, four will remain in Vienna. This will take over the AUA from January 2020 in the "waiting period", i.e. including Eurowings personnel.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and the network planning, the spokesman explained.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only as a "production company" for the group's sister AUA. So among others Barcelona and Rome would be operated with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings equipment. The on-board product should be adapted to that of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and flight attendants come from Eurowings. The AUA flight number Eurowings flights are no longer handled in Terminal 1, but like the AUA in Terminal 3.
The Ryanair subsidiary Laudamotion announced on Thursday that it would increase the fleet in Vienna to 16 aircraft next summer. The Irish low-cost carrier will send four Ryanair aircraft with crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which the union criticized as circumvention of the collective bargaining agreement.
The campaign of Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overtaken AUA in five years was countered by AUA board member Andreas Otto on Friday: "We will remain number one in the location in five, six or ten years".
The Queen's granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, is engaged to be married.
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When they were kids, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married. Beatrice is engaged!
The Royal Family have received some wonderful news: during a holiday to Italy earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, proposed to his girlfriend, Princess Beatrice, 31, the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are thrilled to announce our engagement, we are both so excited to be embarking on this adventure together and can't wait to be married", the couple, who have been together since October 2018, said in the official statement.
And he goes, "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us greatly in the years ahead, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie took the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and posted on her Instagram account.
A feast for royalty
The wedding is scheduled for 2020, and details of the date, location and details will be announced by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the wedding of the ninth in line to the British throne and the real estate mogul will be a similarly big celebration as the wedding of Eugenie with Jack Brooksbank (33) on October 12, 2018.
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, obesity, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease, but what really triggers heart failure or a heart attack?
By analysing the genetic material of 9 000 people, scientists in Hamburg and Switzerland are seeking to discover the causes of cardiovascular disease in greater detail.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday.
The study, which was conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, in collaboration with the National Institute of Health, found that the risk of heart disease is increased by the combination of obesity, smoking, and unhealthy eating habits.
Currently, more than 4,000 of the some 20,000 relevant human genes have known potential disease-causing changes in their DNA - so-called mutations - and some 200 are being added each year, the clinic said.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure and heart attacks, among others.The data could also be used to research other common diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's cardiovascular centre.New insights into the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney and cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data also for research into other diseases. The foundation's clinic in Davos has so far mainly dealt with allergies. Now a Center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created on the medical campus there and a professorship for bioinformatics should be created.
The healthy participants' bioprobes are from Hamburgers who are also taking part in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 subjects, the clinic says, this is the largest local health study in the world.
The first gene sequencing worldwide, the results of which were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is to begin on October 1, all 9000 samples are to be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police free hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 boys from a Koran school who had been tortured and abused. Following reports from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of whom were still minors, as police spokesman Yakubu Sabo reported.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught the Koran and "reformed", but in fact the boys were held by their teachers in "the most degrading and inhuman conditions", said Sabo.
The Koranschule had been in existence for about ten years, according to the information. Residents had drawn the authorities' attention to repeated irregularities in the establishment. Parents had shown themselves shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koranschule, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested, according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koranic schools, replacing the often deficient state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks by armed gangs, which has resulted in more than 40,000 people fleeing across the border to neighbouring Niger in the past ten months, according to the UN Refugee Agency.
Chained and Tortured: Nigerian Police Rescue 400 Children From School
Police officers rescued nearly 400 students from appalling conditions at a school in northern Nigeria. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that suggest torture", said police spokesman Yakubu Sabo in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered on Thursday after a tip-off that they were in an Islamic school, where conditions were "inhumane", and the school principal and six teachers were arrested after the operation.
The children, all boys, were held in slavery and chains at their school, some were sexually abused, and television images showed emaciated and injured students in obviously poor health.
World Cup: Further allegations after Messi and Klopp's election
Football "Signature not valid" football "Signature not valid" football "Signature not valid" football "Signature not valid" football
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe are all in the top three
With a gala in Milan, the world football association FIFA awards the best female player, the best player and the best coach of the year.
After the Nicaraguan captain said he had never voted in the World Cup, other countries have blamed FIFA for not rating Egypt - for a curious reason.
In recent years, much has been discredited at FIFA: the World Cup bids, the dubious plans of its president Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The FIFA World Player Election has not yet been suspected of being unfair - except that the national coaches and national team captains of the member associations often vote on sympathy rather than on objective assessment.
But after Nicaragua's captain complained that he had not voted at all, more irregularities are now emerging: Egypt is complaining that the votes of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account, and in fact they do not appear in the official and publicly visible voting record.
FIFA apologized for "the signatures on the ballot papers were in capital letters and therefore not valid" and contacted the Egyptian Football Association several times to clarify the situation - but received no response.
Sudan's coach also surprised
The Sudanese Football Association (FIFA) has also expressed its concern over the election, stating that while the situation in Egypt is understandable, the Sudanese Football Association (SFA) has stated that coach Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was ultimately voted: with Lionel Messi in first place, Virgil van Dijk in second place and Sadio Mané in third place.
In his case, it was suspected that the Nicaraguan Football Association simply voted in his name.
The statement said that the documents were filled in "by mistake" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan team, but that the second captain, Manuel Rosas, had actually voted. "We take responsibility for the administrative error", the statement said. Both Rosas and team coach Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA".
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but it emphasises that the selection process was monitored externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine: Republican officials call for official investigation
Two senior Republicans have openly called for an official investigation into US President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said Vermont Republican Governor Phil Scott. "Where this goes from here is determined by the facts that are established". He wanted to know more about the whistleblower case before taking action.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's activities in Ukraine.
The Republicans have been reluctant to criticize Trump for the whistleblower affair, but few have expressed discomfort with it. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia has already turned against Trump's policies several times, such as the relaxation of environmental regulations and the tightening of immigration regulations.
Another senior Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker, also spoke in favor of the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation", Baker said. "The right course of action and the responsibility of Congress is now to investigate and get to the bottom of this".
Scott and Baker, as governors of states, have no formal say in the Trump trial, which will be decided in Congress. Their statements are therefore primarily symbolically important. However, first Republican senators have also expressed criticism of the situation. Mitt Romney, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber of parliament, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also reported that the first cracks were brewing among the Republicans.
The affair could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, and Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation into the matter, accusing him of abusing power to influence foreign policy for his own political gain.
There is no exact timetable for impeachment proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try to impeach. The decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
Were torturers on board Racket's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering women in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally entered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees on board.
Now new serious allegations against Rackete are being heard. Three men who are accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived in Italy on the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects were caught in a reception camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants recognized their tormentors in Italy. "We can not rule this out, but we have no reliable information about it ourselves", said "Sea Watch" spokesman Ruben Neugebauer to the German press agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country, Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A. (24), had raped, tortured and even murdered.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They are coming without passports", Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee Libya, so it is quite likely that perpetrators are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is dealt with".
Italy's right-wing ex-minister of the interior, Matteo Salvini, demanded an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still being investigated in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is aiming for the Tesla delivery record
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a huge boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors loved this: Tesla shares went out of business with a gain of over six percent, the most significant increase in nearly four months, and in the second quarter, Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars, its highest ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures must be reached in the current and next quarter. Above all, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
The European Parliament has been asked to vote on the report.
The new financial year in the US will begin on 1 October without a regular budget, and the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and approved transitional funding until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceilings for the 2020 and 2021 fiscal years, the United States is once again without spending plans before the new fiscal year beginning on October 1.The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on transitional funding (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21.
Shutdown averted
The Federal Government is now being funded at the level and according to the priorities of the spending plans for the 2019 fiscal year, which ends on Monday, because Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws that will allocate funds to the various departments and agencies in time, and the Federal Government cannot benefit from the expanded spending budget for the new fiscal year, from 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion dollars.
The Democrats have completed 10 of the 12 bills in the House of Representatives, where they have the majority, but the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Republican-dominated Senate. Conversely, the Senate has also more or less prepared 10 of the 12 spending plans, which are barely majority-capable.
The Republicans in the Senate are apparently trying to force $12 billion for the wall, one of President Trump's big priorities. The Democrats are bothered by the wall's plans and their funding, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. The dispute over the wall had already escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The wall separates the spirits
It is not clear how the parties intend to approach this issue, but the most likely outcome is an extension of the transitional funding beyond 21 November, with a shutdown not excluded.
In the wake of the ongoing inability of Congress to agree on the twelve spending bills in time, and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity. The S. 1877 Shutdown Prevention Bill would automatically continue funding the federal government at the previous year's level, prevent parliamentarians from traveling, and withhold their salaries until the new annual spending plans are presented.
France allows artificial insemination for lesbians and singles
In France, the possibility of artificial insemination is to be extended to single women and lesbians: the National Assembly in Paris voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill allowing all women to undergo in vitro fertilization, which is likely to increase the demand for anonymous donors.
The draft still needs Senate approval, and in the three-day emotional debate, right-wing critics warned that many "children without fathers" could grow up in the future.
The new regulation is the centrepiece of a bioethics law which Health Minister Agnès Buzyn defends as an "opportunity" for society, and which represents the modern family, where children are born to one parent or to homosexual parents, and which proposes that the cost of artificial insemination for all women be covered by social security.
Fertilization with sperm from dead husband still prohibited
The National Assembly rejected by a narrow majority an amendment which would have allowed widows to access the sperm of their dead husband for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the UK, artificial insemination is allowed "post-mortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women have appealed in vain for the release of the sperm of a deceased person.
Many members of the ruling party La République en Marche (The Republic on the Move, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had spoken out against artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow would be imposed a "double mourning" if her husband's death also left her child unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be impregnated with the sperm of a stranger in the future, but not with her own partner.
The French government has announced that it will ban surrogacy for at least two years, but that the law will not apply to couples who cannot have children, and that the law will not apply to those who have been married for at least two years.
In Germany, in theory, artificial insemination is open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for higher education funding to be increased
The country wants to have a climate donation there in the future. The rectors say they have no money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities are also being asked to restrict their use of air transport.
The discussion on a climate levy on flights from universities and colleges, which was postponed before the summer break, is back in full swing. After the state rectors' conference reacted skeptically to a corresponding initiative from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six universities in Baden-Württemberg and a pedagogical college plead for compensation of service flights. This is "urgently necessary" as a first step, at the same time there must be a broad debate on the avoidance of flights, says their statement. The decision on the levy originally planned in July is on hold, because the CDU has not yet submitted the proposal of the Green Party.
Russia arrests North Korean fishermen again
According to the FSB, the suspects were caught fishing illegally in Russian waters, and ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen were arrested, leading to a shootout between the border guards and the boat crew, which left three Russians and one North Korean injured, with the fisherman later succumbing to his injuries.
The North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard is said to be patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 squid seized
The Commission has also been informed that the Commission has not yet adopted a decision on the application of the new rules on the protection of personal data.
The Russian fisheries authority has not issued fishing licences to the North Koreans this year, following complaints from local businesses.
Georgi Martynow, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye Region, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by the North Korean fishermen who used tight-meshed synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures from the sea and throw the nets into the sea, where they take 200 years to decompose.
The United States is reducing the asylum ceiling to 18,000
"The most generous nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The richest country on earth is closing its doors to those seeking protection: The State Department in Washington confirmed that the legal limit for the admission of refugees will be further reduced, with the aim of granting asylum to the most threatened believers and Iraqis.
The US government wants to lower the already historically low limit for the admission of new refugees. In the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, the US State Department said that a maximum of 18,000 people should be allowed into the country. In the fiscal year that is almost over, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception of asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, and under his predecessor, Barack Obama, the reception limits were much higher.
The proposed refugee cap of 18,000 would be the lowest since the US refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department described the US as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a phrase that strongly resembles the language of the incumbent US president.
"Responsible treatment" of refugees is aimed at allowing refugees to return to their home countries to help with reconstruction, Trump said.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico, which Trump wants to seal off. To be able to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed the National Emergency. Whether there is a temporal connection between the current measure and the current domestic political developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure due to the Selenskiy affair and a possible impeachment proceedings.
The US government intends to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have thus been put in danger, according to the State Department statement.
The US wants to get people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to seek asylum in other countries. Against this background, the United States has concluded migration agreements with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders orangutans released from zoo
The report, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union, states that the number of people who have been infected with HIV in the EU is rising by more than a third, and that the number of people who have died from AIDS in the EU is rising by more than a third.
The 53-kilogram (53 kg) ape is unable to adapt to life in the wild, and is expected to live in the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where 21 orangutans and 31 chimpanzees are already housed, including Bubbles, former pet of pop star Michael Jackson.
After her birth in Rostock, Sandra spent a few years at the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before being moved to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 lawsuit by animal rights activists for Sandra's fundamental rights has helped to transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education center for the preservation of biodiversity will be created there.
Swiss record for climbing the Extreme Mountains: 550 meters in 46 minutes
Extreme mountaineer Dani Arnold has been successful in a new hussar ride on the almost 3,000-metre-high Great Tinne in the Italian Alps.
Without a net, double ground or other aids, the Swiss conquered the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Pyramid in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, a T-shirt, and backed only by absolute freedom from the elements, Arnold took 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, beating the old record by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now the record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European Northwalls.
Nike is benefiting from new online marketing strategy
Despite the trade conflict with China, the US sportswear manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit increase. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion (nearly €1.3 billion) in the past quarter, up 25 percent from the same period last year, the group said on Tuesday. This is mainly due to the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly reaches its customers online.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three months to the end of August, with Nike's sales in China growing by 22 percent. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company also benefited in the People's Republic from its approach to reaching consumers directly through the Internet or smartphone apps.
Nike's chief financial officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to invest in the sportswear maker's "digital transformation" and expand its competitive advantage.
Life ban from stadium because of racism in Italy
The Brazilian defender Jesus was insulted by the fan on Instagram, and Jesus then posted the private messages and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Proud to be who I am", wrote the 28-year-old, who has been playing for AS Rom since 2016.
The club reacted late on Thursday, reporting the fan's Instagram account and the police, and that the Roma supporter should never attend a club game again, the club wrote on Twitter.
"We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. Those responsible must be identified and thrown out of the stadiums", Fifa president Gianni Infantino said at the weekend.
The Italian authorities have banned 38 disorderly fans of record-breaking Juventus Turin from entering the stadium, four of them for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations against 12 leaders of ultra-fan groups in the Juventus area, accused of serious extortion, money laundering and private violence, among other things.
Italian media reports claim that the ultra leaders are behind the black market in tickets, "militarily controlling" the ticketing for the fan club and blackmailing Juventus staff to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political -- whole generations are given fancy names, and if you look closely, the awards are full of contradictions, so how well do these labels describe the way that young people feel about life?
"The Crabs Are Coming!" This call officially kicked off the crab fishing in Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, which also marked the opening of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, according to the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outskirts of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields".
The people of Gaochun started raising crabs in the early 1990s. Over time, the crabs industry has become a major industry, generating high income and becoming an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crabs, as well as technology-based crabs, and the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and farmers' income.
In recent years, Gaochun has advanced a reform to "distributor of power, optimization of administration and public services", and has carefully built the "permitting under one roof service network, law enforcement team, service network, lending platform", in order to comprehensively optimize the permitting, service and development environment.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of the local advantages of connecting to southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui, and is using the development zone and its status as an international "slow city" as a showcase to attract high-end intelligent production enterprises, enterprises for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, enterprises from the cultural and health sector, and enterprises for ecological agriculture, which are leaders in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the development of a national, comprehensive tourism zone and of Gaochun's transportation sources of greater importance. Here, the ecological and cultural resources of the countryside of Gaochun have been improved, the condition of citizens' buildings and public services have been comprehensively improved, and the quality of public services has been improved, leading to the development of "Tourism +2", "Tourism +" and "Tourism + 6" at a high level. Gaochun has also promoted the development of a national, comprehensive tourism zone and of Gaochun's transportation.
Conflict between Iran and the US: Rouhani speaks of ending sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions after returning from the UN General Assembly, saying the United States would offer an end to all sanctions in return for talks with Tehran's leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
However, US President Donald Trump contradicted the Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions against them so that there would be a meeting.
Rouhani said that the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says, 'I'm lifting the sanctions,'" Rouhani said.
The EU is also committed to the promotion of the rights of women and girls, and to the promotion of equal opportunities for women and girls, and to the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreement with Iran, which was negotiated with Russia and China. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed hope on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly that Rouhani will meet with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes hit western Turkey in a short period of time, fears of a disaster are growing. 34 people were injured in Tuesday's earthquake, and nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred since the previous day's quake, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, raising fears of a disaster.
The quake, which struck the Marmaray region of Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the metropolis of millions, has caused hundreds of buildings to be damaged and the government is now planning to set up a commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, Oktay said.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and the city itself has ignored the latent danger, with poorly constructed residential buildings collapsing every year, among other things, due to the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
Urban planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces that were registered as sanctuaries in the center have long since been built.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Sea of Marmara off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the disaster management agency Afad.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that no injuries or damage were initially reported.The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of houses in panic.Students were taken out of buildings for security reasons in the Silivri district.Some students were crying, as seen in pictures.
Turkey is particularly prone to earthquakes. The North Anatolian fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates, lies beneath the Sea of Marmara. Turkey is rocked by earthquakes from time to time. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul, which killed more than 17,000 people.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 could be imminent, but it is unclear when the earthquake will occur.
Companies are designing contingency plans, individuals have prepared Go-bags with all the necessary equipment, and schools are teaching children how to behave when the earth shakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people were injured, and some buildings suffered minor damage.Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was monitoring developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom).He said two minarets of mosques in Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
On social networks, many users report panic. Buildings shook. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone lines were cut. It was more intense than Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Klinik, warned via Twitter of aftershocks. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The official time of the quake is 1:59 p.m. local time, and CNN Turkey reports that just minutes after the first quake, a 4.0 magnitude aftershock occurred.
On Tuesday, a 4.6-magnitude earthquake shook the Turkish Marmara region, with its epicenter in the Marmara Sea west of the metropolis, the disaster management agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers believe that sooner or later, there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high, and scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
"This could be the signs of a larger earthquake", Ersoy told CNN Türk. "Sooner or later the big one will come".
The Commission is also aware that the European Parliament has been asked to give its opinion on the draft budget for the financial year, and that the Council has not yet taken up its position on the draft budget.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two explosive documents provide new fuel in the Ukraine affair about possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment process, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaint about Trump filed by an anonymous whistleblower and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president are important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself as a victim of a "witch hunt" more than once. In addition, he doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United Airlines passenger locked in toilet - plane diverted
A United Airlines flight was diverted because a passenger was locked in the onboard toilet, and the toilet door was blocked during Flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline said in a statement, according to US media.
The woman was finally released from the narrow cabin on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, where she was trapped for about an hour, according to U.S. media reports, citing other passengers.
A video that has been circulating on the Internet, and which according to US media is from Flight 1554, shows several people trying to free the woman. "We are working on opening the door right now, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all the passengers. It was unclear at first whether the woman will receive compensation.
The cockroach: inspired by Kafka, Ian McEwan writes Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos, and he's writing a book about it, and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous short story "The Transformation", British bestselling author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in the UK.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published in German on November 27th, Diogenes Verlag (Zürich) has announced. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now is suddenly the most powerful man in Great Britain. He sees it as his mission to put the will of the people into action and is determined to let nothing and no one stop him.
McEwan was quoted as saying, "When parliament is shut down so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers are lying shamelessly as Soviet leaders once did, when Brexiteers in high places are actually bringing about the catastrophe of no deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write". McEwan had only appeared in the spring of the novel Machines Like Me about artificial intelligence.
Kafka's 1915 novel is about Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself "transformed into a monstrous monster", gradually excluded from family and society, and eventually destroyed. "Ian McEwan bows to Kafka to describe a world that stands on its head", Diogenes Publishing said.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austrian railway infrastructure
11,200 wagons in Austria and Hungary are being fitted with whisper brakes to reduce noise from freight trains.Sections of the railway links between Graz and Györ and between Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are also being modernised and electrified.
The EU authorities say this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions.Funds will come from the EU's Connecting Europe Facility infrastructure fund.
Thomas Cook: All travel is cancelled until October 31
The German tour operator Thomas Cook has cancelled all trips until October 31, 2019, one day after its bankruptcy filing.
The company also said that bookings made by Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Reisen, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Reisen and Air Marin, which had already been paid or had been paid in full, were affected.
In Germany, Thomas Cook was in the throes of bankruptcy for its British parent company, which filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday.
Insurer wants to transfer money back to hotels immediately
From this Friday, however, hotels abroad that are currently hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance.
"This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travellers are not asked or otherwise forced to pay individual hotel bills by these hotels from now on", said Bernd Engelien, a spokesman for the German Press Agency.
The insurance company was reacting to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the spot, some of whom had to pay more than 1,000 euros, a move sharply criticised by the German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the financial interests of the European Communities against fraud and other illegal activities in the field of the internal market, which aims to ensure that the financial interests of the European Communities are protected by the principle of non-discrimination.
The insolvency administrators want to try to continue the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a solution for the future.
The company's latest announcement of hotel payments will only help travelers who are currently on the road. Thomas Cook customers who are planning to fly for their first holiday are in for a bad time. Late on Thursday evening, the company announced that all travel would be cancelled until October 31 inclusive, including those bookings that had already been paid for.
As for travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In coordination with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure will be examined, it was said. Basically, the insurance company Zurich is also responsible for these cases.
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by Kaera.Customers could find out on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and could claim via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys land mines in Angola
Prince Harry has long been the heir to Lady Diana's engagement, and in Africa he is now following in his mother's footsteps.
Dressed in a blue splinter vest, Britain's Prince Harry detonated and destroyed a landmine in Angola.
The blast was detected by the UK Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, where the blast occurred on Friday morning in front of live TV cameras. The blast exploded in the savannah area without causing any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone has destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the bloody decades-long conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to follow in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997) in the city of Huambo. With the same bomb-maker who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she had taken.
Harry, 35, and his wife Meghan, 38, have been on a 10-day tour of Africa since Monday, starting in the South African tourist metropolis of Cape Town.
The EU is also working to improve the quality of its public services.
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be the one to guarantee a third postponement of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements have been made by polarizing Britons for a long time. The recent ruling of the Supreme Court in the UK hovers like a sword of Damocles over the blond's scalp. His suspension of Parliament to be able to stubbornly carry out his Brexit course until the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to extend the bilateral talks until October 31 in the event of successful negotiations with the EU. However, Johnson had always categorically ruled this out.
Boris Johnson still thinks the deal is possible
But the pressure seems to have not gone away on Johnson either, who has since hinted in a visit to a hospital that he would support a prolongation of the negotiations if the talks were not completed by the end of October:
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
But at the same time we are confident that we will be leaving the EU by 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And the time is running out for the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British negotiators have about six weeks to prevent the UK leaving the European Union without an agreement. The recent talks have again failed to achieve a breakthrough. An agreement by the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. But if the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in force. The opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister, however. They fear that Johnson could somehow enforce Brexit in the event of a no-deal.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to e-cigarette use in the United States has risen to twelve. There are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries related to e-cigarettes, the US health agency CDC reported. A study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" reported that there were already more than 900 cases, about 500 of which were confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still not completely clear. No similar increase in lung damage has been reported in Europe. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of Muhammad Ali videos have been shared online, and the Spanish-based construction entrepreneur and actor is calling for a "people's revolution". For Friday, he has called for more protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whom critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement.
The security forces are on high alert, with a heavy police presence in central Cairo, several metro stations closed, and roads around central Tahrir Square blocked.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of people took part in protests in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansoura, the largest such outright protest in Egypt in years. The security forces reacted with similar severity. According to Human Rights Watch, nearly 2,000 people have been arrested since last week. Many of them were arbitrarily arrested - simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW told detainees, citing lawyers.
The organization also criticized censorship in the North African country, saying that the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi, who has ruled the country since 2013 after overthrowing the democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs returns from Greenland expedition
Polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, and was greeted at the port of Hamburg by, among others, skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic on the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had spent the past few months studying and documenting the effects of global warming on his sailing vessel, the Dagmar Aaen, off the coasts of Iceland and Greenland.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar explorer. He has waited for years for the young generation to speak up. We have known for decades that the Earth is warming. Yet many people act as if there is a Planet B.
"What happens at sea is often hidden from the public", said Fuchs, who and his team wanted to educate people about the effects of global warming and marine pollution, including measuring Greenland glacier ice with a drone and fishing for microplastics with nets.
For his "struggle for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness to the changes that have taken place in the Arctic in recent decades".
Spaghetti is expensive in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Engelsburg in Rome: This seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The bill, which included an 80 euro tip, was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which caused a lot of reaction.
"Cases like this damage the reputation of Rome, and we are calling on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud", said a spokesman for Federagit, the association of tourist guides in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (Friday edition).
The reaction of the restaurant owners was immediate. The Japanese women had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the restaurant owner justified. However, this is not shown in the bill. Even a tip of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A phone call in Ukraine and everything is broken? US President Donald Trump could indeed face impeachment after the turbulent revelations of the past few days, the Democrats want to check this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - we are talking about weeks until a decision would fall.
The alleged source of the scandal is a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky. The whistleblower, who ultimately made the conversation public out of concern for national security and US democracy with his complaint, is monstrous: the president abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country to influence the 2020 election, exploiting Ukraine's dependence on blackmail and forcing them to take action against a political opponent.
The core of this plot is also to be found in the now published transcript of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not reproduce the full text. The July 25 phone call is only one episode of a much larger story, in the center of which, besides Trump, is his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the public's perspective in May 2019, when the New York Times reports on Rudy Giuliani's plans to travel to Ukraine to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation to which we have the right", he told the newspaper. People may think it is inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal about it". Giuliani wants investigations to be conducted in Ukraine for which there is hardly any basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my client and could prove helpful to my government".
The lawyer and former New York mayor appears to have been infected by right-wing conspiracy fantasies that have been fixed on Trump's 2016 presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, who critics said at the time conspired with actors in Ukraine to create a pretext for the Russia investigation in the U.S. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
The version of Giuliani and the president is: former vice president and currently promising candidate for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, as Ukraine representative of the Obama administration, pushed for the dismissal of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin, in order to stop the investigation he was responsible for the gas company, in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden worked. Biden senior had financially blackmailed Ukraine to cover up his family's corrupt dealings.
In fact, the process was somewhat different: when Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian attorney general should go, the investigation against the gas company had already been completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Schokin was also accused of being deeply corrupt, the US government was far from the only Western partner pushing for his dismissal. Moreover, the Obama administration even explicitly supported the investigation against the company.
Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp disrupted: Social media is down
Users worldwide report massive disruptions on Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain are mainly affected. On the website allestörungen.de, users report that Facebook has not been loading since about 3:30 p.m.
Instagram and Co. more affected by disruptions
This is not the first major disruption this year, as services were down for several hours in March and July, and users are turning to Twitter to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists rescued from the ice of Antarctica by the Chilean Air Force were traveling in a rubber boat several miles from their base when their engine failed, but they were lucky in the accident - less than an hour was needed for the Chilean rescue helicopter to rescue them.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the Chilean 4th Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 we got the message, at just before ten we were off, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the rubber boat".
Poland has been operating the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, with 19 scientists working there.
Caution: NEVER charge your smartphone without a cable
Practical but Harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since several new smartphones have recently come on the market, which support wireless charging and are selling very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to recall a study from the beginning of July.
Higher temperature is killing the battery.
Researchers warn against wireless charging of smartphones. This is extremely harmful to the devices according to the findings of the Univerity of Warwick. The reason for this is the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a mobile phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. When charging wirelessly, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees even with the perfect alignment of the smartphone on the charging pad. If the mobile phone is located next to the coil, the temperature rises even higher. In addition, the wattage of the charging pad also rises, which in turn drives up the power consumption.
Capacity and life
According to the researchers, the temperature is a decisive factor for the battery's durability. Every single degree plays a role. Charging at higher temperatures not only reduces the battery's capacity, but also reduces its overall durability. The battery life is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery replacement in modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this may be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of a battery replacement even once - for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: just place the device on a suitable charging pad - these are now installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the hassle of cables and the hassle of plugging.As a global standard is being established with Qi (stands for inductive energy transfer), which, exceptionally, even Apple is involved in, there are hardly any limitations.However, the researchers say the technology should only be used in exceptional cases.
Everest photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer claimed to have climbed 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world in just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has made international headlines once before: he is the author of a photo of climbers queuing on Mount Everest that went viral in the spring.
The image of the mass protest sparked a debate about increased security measures on the 8,848-meter mountain and the highest peak on earth.
A problem for Purja could be the 14th Eight Thousanders climb: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather among other reasons.
Four Elephants Found Dead in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and much-visited ancient rock fortress of Sigiriya, and the police spokesman said the animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, and an autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year, often by farmers whose land the animals have previously been protected, and about 50 people are killed by elephants each year, mostly when the animals wander through built-up villages near their habitat.
It is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left in Sri Lanka, and killing them is theoretically punishable by death.
Detained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker Stena Impero is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after being detained by Iran, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard announced, according to the IRNA news agency.
The management of Thomas Cook in the criticism
The House of Commons's economic affairs committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook, including the salary packages of its board of directors and why the British government is not helping the struggling company. "Our interest is in the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors", said committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "We are clearly dealing with a bad example of management greed".
Experts say genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in the familial increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. This is the conclusion reached by researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) in Heidelberg in a recent study. Other risk factors such as family dietary habits are therefore likely to be more important than previously thought. This has consequences for individual calculations of the risk of colon cancer, emphasise the DKFZ scientists.
Elon Musk is pushing Tesla's shares higher
In an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek on Thursday (local time), Musk wrote that demand is strong, so that Tesla could record 110,000 orders, Musk's newsletter continued.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and to do that, Tesla needs to put as many resources as possible into the end of the quarter.
Investors loved the news: Tesla's shares were up more than six percent, the biggest gain in nearly four months, and Tesla delivered more than 95,000 cars in the second quarter, its best ever.
Musk needs records to achieve his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit figures are needed in the current and next quarter. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but the profit margins are small. Despite the boom, there were losses.
The British government wants to circumvent the Brexit Act?
The British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has said he is not looking for ways to circumvent the law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit, but on Friday he told reporters that his government would comply with the law.
The bill requires the government to request a delay in the exit deadline if no deal is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson has criticised as "capitulation" legislation that would make negotiations with the EU more difficult.
Former British Prime Minister John Major said on Thursday that he suspected Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law, using a procedural trick to delay the law's entry into force until after Brexit.
Johnson said he was seeking a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident of leaving the EU on 31 October and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran is apparently ramping up uranium enrichment.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European partners in the dispute over the salvation of the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states are showing an inability or unwillingness to take concrete action", Rouhani said at a press conference on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday, and he said that if they do not live up to their promises, he will take "further steps" away from the agreements of the hard-won 2015 trade agreement.
The background is the conflict over the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which in return included the promise to Tehran to normalize economic relations. The US left the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change course in the Middle East policy considered aggressive. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now back on tough sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing to use the centrifuges installed in early September with uranium.
The European Union has also been involved in the negotiations with the United States, which have been in the making for some time, and the European Union has been involved in the negotiations with the United States, which have been in the making for some time.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the common position has changed after an attack on a major oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and Britain on Monday followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence", said Rouhani, which European leaders could not do in their talks with him during the UN General Assembly debate, instead citing the inability of the rebels to carry out such an attack.
The EU's foreign policy is to be based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, which is the foundation of the UN Charter, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Comet from another star crossing the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from deep space, the first time they've been able to do so, and the comet is allowing inferences about other solar systems.
What was initially a mere conjecture has now been confirmed: an interstellar guest is crossing our solar system. The comet from deep space has been named 2I/Borisov after its discoverer and has attracted the interest of astronomers around the world.
The most distant comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea, using a self-made telescope with a diameter of 65 centimeters.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object to be observed during a transit of our solar system, after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers a rare chance to get a close-up view of an alien solar system before it disappears forever.Early observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to those in our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute.
The comet is on a so-called hyperbolic orbit, which takes it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) said. It is also responsible for the naming and categorization of celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar tail star, which had initially been listed under the catalog number C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov was spotted in flight, leaving researchers many months to study it. "The object will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explained Farnocchia. "After that, it will only be observed with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor in their sights, and a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, determined the diameter of the celestial object to be 2 to 16 kilometers in a first survey.
Researchers from the Institute of Astrophysics of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar tail star, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this indicates that their composition must be similar", reported IAC researcher Julia de León.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors in just two years, according to the IAU, suggests that these objects could open a new way to study certain processes in other solar systems.
The agency wants to station the three-part spacecraft "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position 1.5 million kilometers from Earth by 2028, according to ESA science director Günther Hasinger, either on an untouched, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellar visitor like 1I/'Oumuamua.
First landing at Beijing's new mega airport Daxing
Just before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the time has come: the first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually by 2022, and 72 million by 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project.
The complex has four runways, later to be expanded to seven, and is equipped with the world's largest automated air traffic management system.
The opening of the capital airport in Germany, which has been under construction since 2006 and is much smaller, has been repeatedly postponed.
New supersonic plane to fly from London to Sydney in four and a half hours by 2030
The British space agency UK Space Agency is dreaming of flying from London to Sydney in just four and a half hours. A special propulsion system (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by the Oxfordshire-based company Reaction Engines is to make this supersonic flight possible in the 2030s, CNN reported. "This is the technology that could definitely do it", said agency chief Graham Turnock.
The British space agency is working with the Australian space agency to advance the project. A flight from the British capital to the Australian capital currently takes about 20 hours. The only passenger-carrying supersonic aircraft to date, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its discontinuation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident during the takeoff of a Concorde at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, in which all 109 people on board were killed. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic aircraft, the "X-Plane", together with the US space agency NASA. Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", Reaction Engines writes on its homepage. "Sabre's propulsion could be used for efficient travel at Mach 5 - five times the speed of sound".
Trump wants to track down anonymous tipsters in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine case, Donald Trump wants to find possible leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information", Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy to the United Nations in New York on Thursday, calling the person involved "almost a spy" and saying that in the past, such people were dealt with "a little differently" than they are today.
The event was not public, but several US media outlets aired audio clips of the speech on Friday, and Democrats reacted angrily to the president's statement.
On Tuesday, the House Democrats announced preparations for impeachment proceedings against Trump, based primarily on a written complaint from an unnamed intelligence official who made serious allegations against Trump and his administration.
In the course of his work, the whistleblower claims to have obtained information from several government employees that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in the US election in 2020 in his favor.
The allegations center on a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his office colleagues to investigate, which could harm his political rival Joe Biden, regarding Biden's son Hunter's past dealings in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his offspring from the Ukrainian judiciary.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukraine phone call: senior government officials had made an effort to keep the exact text of the conversation under the covers. As usual, an electronic text log was made. This was removed from a database normally provided for this purpose by the White House lawyers, but was instead stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a rough transcript of the conversation has been published.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, but the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA foreign intelligence agency.
Trump again questioned the source's credibility on Friday, tweeting that the "so-called whistleblower" had leaked second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate, and that "there may be no tipsters or spies".
Trump's comments in New York about those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower sparked outrage, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressing concern and lamenting that Trump's statement once again undermined the integrity of the administration.
The House of Representatives has been investigating Trump and his entourage for months, and the Democrats are now pushing ahead with new investigations to launch a possible impeachment trial against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a timetable for our investigation", said the head of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked Schiff sharply, accusing him of misrepresenting the facts, and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly insults Schiff and had already demanded his withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government security and foreign policy officials, many of them under Democratic and Republican presidents, backed the Democratic impeachment inquiry in a statement released Friday, saying that if the allegations were true, Trump had "abused his power without scruple".
There is no exact timetable for the next proceedings. With their majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could try to impose a so-called impeachment procedure. The decision on an actual impeachment would be made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The chances of success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has ever been removed from office by an impeachment procedure.
VW works council: jobs are being 'sneakily' cut
VW's plans to further reduce costs in production could come at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the carmaker's operating board. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 2023 from ten billion euros. Of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The "Future Pact" negotiated between the company and the works council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle, a job can only be reduced at the car manufacturer if it is virtually proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security applies until 2029.
However, as our newspaper learned from the circles of the works council, jobs in production which were not actually available were being "sneakily" cut by another route - that is, bypassing the official course.
The works council had no way of forcing the reemployment in these cases. Meanwhile, many jobs lack staff, the workload is increasing, the worries about a gradual outflow of the vehicle factories are growing. This also raises the fear that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world. VW said only: "An adjustment of the volume of employment is carried out as agreed along the socially compatible demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardise production even more globally and centrally control new projects, which will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - the goal is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness.
The company has already achieved success in this area: for example, this year, for the first time since 2013, the production cost per vehicle will decrease compared to last year. Tostmann told journalists that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on October 24 in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
20 hours.
In our region, the Stammwerk Wolfsburg is the only VW factory where vehicles are produced. The plants in Braunschweig and Salzgitter produce components. For Wolfsburg, the VW internal rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built there annually for the plant to be sufficiently profitable.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, however, a million cars are to be rolled off the production line in Wolfsburg "in the future". This should make it possible to concentrate Golf production in the main plant - because the Zwickau plant is preparing for Golf by converting it into a location for e-car production.
In addition, the SUVs Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently been declining.
Voodoo forced into prostitution: human traffickers convicted
Young Nigerian women have been sworn into the Ruhr and forced into prostitution, and six suspected traffickers have been sentenced to prison.
The European Parliament has been urged to take action to combat the spread of the virus and to ensure that the disease is not spread to the rest of the world, and to ensure that the disease is not spread to other countries, including the United States, where it is still endemic.
The victims were aged between 17 and 22 years. They were transported across the Mediterranean Sea in inflatable boats with the help of Libyan smugglers. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. When they arrived in Germany, they were distributed to various brothels to work off the alleged smuggling costs of an average of 25 000 euros. Therefore, their wages were completely deducted.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted in their trial that they had locked up and then distributed the young Nigerian women in brothels. "The work made it physically and mentally hard for the women to work", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann when she delivered the verdict.
The sentences were for the forced labour of foreigners, human trafficking, pimping and forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
In the midst of a long-running dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the flight attendant union Ufo has again threatened to strike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on October 14 about the industrial action in the LH group", Ufo Tarif Board member Daniel Flohr said on Friday. Lufthansa and its subsidiary Eurowings have been refusing for months to conduct collective bargaining with Ufo.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover all air carriers with a commercial airline model, including those with a commercial airline model, and to include air carriers with a commercial airline model, such as the United States Air Force, the United Kingdom Air Force, the United Kingdom Air Transport Association and the United Kingdom Air Transport Association.
In August, Lufthansa had also submitted an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt to have the status of the Ufo as a trade union reviewed by the court.
A fierce leadership dispute had taken place in the Spartan Union, in the course of which numerous members of the board of directors and the advisory board resigned, including long-time union leader Nicoley Baublies.
Saudi Arabia announces new visa system to facilitate entry into the country
Saudi Arabia has not been known as an international tourist magnet until now, but that is about to change as the Persian Gulf country is planning to introduce new visa requirements.
Saudi Arabia is looking to attract more international tourists with a new visa system and to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year by 2030, the tourism commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country", said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia is currently difficult for tourists to access.Visas are usually issued only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visits with relatives in the desert state.With the new rules, the ultraconservative kingdom hopes to generate more revenue from the tourism business.Riyadh says it wants to reduce its dependence on the oil trade.
In September, several missiles and drones had struck two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oilfield.In the middle ofthe year, the national oil production plummeted, the oil prices skyrocketing.It is likely to take several weeks for the kingdom's oil production to return to its old level.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding party.
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party.The model posted several party photos on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in her white wedding dress.Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed outfits on Instagram, asking his followers to "help me choose my tuxedo for the wedding".
The Biebers gave their word in a New York law firm a year ago, the biggest party they'd ever seen.
In a recent interview with Australian Vogue, Hailey said that after initial problems, the two had found a common ground: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two killed in Czech plane crash
Two people have died in the crash of a small plane in the western Czech Republic, the police said, after the wreckage was discovered in a forested area near the town of Mecin on Friday.
The crash site is located about 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Pilsen and 100 kilometres (62 mi) northeast of Regensburg.[1] The crash site is located in the southern part of the city, near the city of Pölz.
Half of European tree species are threatened with extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-native species, unsustainable logging, and the growth of cities are also factors in the threat, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reported Friday in Brussels. It has studied the populations of all 454 tree species known in Europe, 265 of which are found nowhere else on the continent.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories, ranging from "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "endangered", and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct", and it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as threatened.
The threat to the wild and feral breed of Rosskastania
In Germany, the most threatened are the Eberes (Sorbus), said one of the authors, David Allen, to the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because of the conversion or weakening of their habitats".
The greatest threat, along with a fungus, is the Balkan mini-moth. It has been spreading since the 1980s from Southeastern Europe across the entire continent and has few natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild rose chestnuts (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000 specimens. Trees in cities, parks and alleys are not taken into account in this assessment.
Shrubs and Moose Also Endangered
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrimps and mosses.More than one-fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all shrimp species are threatened, according to the IUCN.This is mainly due to the destruction of the wilderness, introduced species, agricultural practices and climate change.Molluscs such as snails play a key role in recycling nutrients in the soil and are an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and under-estimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet", said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the European Office.
Earthquake outside Istanbul: 34 reported injured
Turkey's latest earthquake has injured 34 people, but left no fatalities, dozens of people displaced and 14 schools in Istanbul closed for safety reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and nearly 200 aftershocks have occurred since the quake on Thursday, which shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul and caused panic in the metropolis.
The government is now considering setting up a commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, said Oktay.Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes, and under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Anatolian fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake near Istanbul in 1999, with an epicenter in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.
Earlier on Tuesday, a 4.6 magnitude earthquake shook the Istanbul area, prompting authorities to urge residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will host the halftime show of the upcoming American Football Super Bowl, the singers announced on Twitter. "It's not getting any bigger", Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez.
Jennifer Lopez stated that she has dreamed of performing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'll be performing with another Latina". She said she can't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she was honored to be standing alongside another artist on one of the biggest stages in the world, representing Latinos and Latinas from the U.S. and around the world. "And then on my birthday!" the main sponsor of the event tweeted that it was the first time the two "queens" had ever been on a stage together.
Shakira is from Colombia, Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fighting declining viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season, and the game and the halftime show are among the most watched television programs in the U.S. Even if you've seen a recent drop in viewership, this February, the spectacle attracted the fewest viewers in the U.S. in more than a decade, yet it still averaged nearly a hundred million people.
The halftime show of the last Super Bowl had been rioted in advance: In the dispute over the treatment of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to media reports last February, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform. Finally, the pop group Maroon 5 led the halftime show - the critics were not very friendly.
Kaepernick, then the quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had kneeled during the 2016-17 NFL season before NFL games in protest against police violence and racism. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took over the gesture. This caused a great deal of excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African-American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been unemployed since March 2017 and has not played an NFL game.
Hotels get money from insurance
The collapse of travel provider Thomas Cook is likely to cost some banks dear, according to a press report. High depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans is threatening, including Credit Suisse, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit and Credit Suisse could have to write off up to £1.8 billion (around €2 billion) in total, according to the report, according to estimates by the consultancy firm AlixPartners.
The amount of write-offs would be between £900 million and £1 billion for bondholders and between £550 million and £825 million for lenders, with the actual write-offs likely to be at the upper end of the range, an expert told the paper.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the European Union's financial interests are not undermined by the financial crisis, and that the European Union's financial interests are not undermined by the financial crisis, and that the European Union's financial interests are not undermined by the financial crisis.
Rackete is said to have brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who allegedly tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any certain information about it ourselves", said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the dpa news agency.
The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East, calling on the European Union to take all necessary steps to ensure that the situation in the Middle East is not further damaged by the conflict, and to ensure that the situation in the Middle East is not worsened by the threat of a nuclear war.
The Italian authorities have confirmed that the ship was carrying illegal migrants and that it had struck a ship belonging to the Italian financial police on 29 June, the same day that the three suspects arrived in the port of Lampedusa.
US warns German government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network provider Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great", Pai told the Handelsblatt, looking ahead to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that requires any company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The FCC chief added that "the law prohibits companies from informing third parties about such requests", which makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to require suppliers to make a "declaration of trustworthiness".
Berlin would first try to control the risks, for example by technical solutions, reports the Handelsblatt, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible.
The software is what is important in keeping the devices up to date, and this software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time", Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that any government agency, "anywhere, would be able to review every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese company Huawei of having close contacts with the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership structure is opaque, and the employee company that is supposedly owned by the company is not necessarily independent of the government", Pai told the Handelsblatt.
The US has intelligence that government employees are being placed inside the company.
Chemical factory in northern France burns: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions, a giant wall of fire lights up the sky above a chemical factory in northern France, and the fire has been extinguished after hours, but the cleanup may now take days.
Schools and kindergartens in the region remain closed after a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday.
The Ministry of the Interior had urged citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to expose themselves to smoke. There were no injuries. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, protect their feed and set the harvest first.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, as the prefecture announced. There is still a risk that the smell will spread after the extinguishment, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 police and gendarmes were deployed at the fire scene.
The chemical plant had previously erupted a giant column of black smoke. French media reported huge flames and explosions at the Lubrizol factory, which produces additives for oil. The production facility is located a few kilometers from the city center.
The plant in Normandy, which according to the authorities belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites, is under special surveillance.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told BFMTV that "no high toxicity" had been detected in samples, but that contamination of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out, and that dams had been built in the river to prevent pollution, the prefecture said.
The fire broke out at around 2.40am, authorities said, but the cause was unclear.
French Finance Minister: 'Germany must invest now'
French Economy and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system for the exchange of information on the European Union's external borders.
The economy in the eurozone was weakening, the minister warned.
We cannot wait until the economic situation deteriorates to take the necessary decisions".
The Commission's proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a European Agency for the Development of Vocational Training (EAD) is a step in the right direction.
The Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of taxation for the import of agricultural products from third countries is based on the principle of the free movement of goods, and the Commission's proposal to introduce a system of taxation for the import of agricultural products from third countries is based on the principle of the free movement of goods.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to increase public investment to boost the European economy, and German politicians have repeatedly called on France to tackle its budget deficit.
The French 2020 budget, presented on Thursday, provides tax breaks of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the yellow vest movement, which wants to reduce the debt to 2.2 percent, down from 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson dodges question on Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson has sharply criticised the "Capitulation Act" passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law requires the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit. Critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a loophole. However, the Tory politician gives way to this possibility.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is hesitant about whether he wants to enforce a no-deal Brexit - despite the recent law passed by Parliament, which is supposed to prevent that.
The law requires the government to request a delay in the withdrawal period if no deal is reached with the EU by mid-October, which Johnson criticises as a "capitulation law" that makes negotiations with the EU more difficult.
The UK's former Prime Minister John Major had suggested on Thursday that Johnson might try to use "political harassment" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick to delay the entry into force of the law until after the EU's exit.
John's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said he saw the political wrangles over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the intended EU exit would still come true: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave, no worries", Cummings told the British newspaper Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now the chief strategist at Downing Street, the headquarters of the British government, and is said to be behind the intransigent policy that has put the prime minister in a desperate situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin -- they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers, but it doesn't always have to be the great glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram, "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a glimpse into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona, until she found photography, always had a camera with her, she took thousands of Polaroids, several hundred of which are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
"She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword, "and of course, the focus is always on one: her husband Paul - as you may never have seen him before.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, telephones in a bathrobe with a bag over his head or wears shapely moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also lived a normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in the south of England or in Scotland. So Mary McCartney said according to the BBC that as a baby she had slept in a bed that her father had made out of old potato boxes. And tidy up, it wasn't always the case with the McCartneys.
Like few other media, the Polaroid camera captures the immediate moment, and while Linda McCartney's footage is certainly a kind of family diary, it's much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens in front of you. And then you have to snap it at the exact right moment", said Paul McCartney. "If you snap it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift of always capturing the exact right moment. "She just knew she had it", said Paul in the Eshun essay.
The lighting, the composition, the cutting and the colour make The Polaroid Diaries not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes can sometimes seem like abstract paintings, the perfect complement to the newly released Beatles album Abbey Road, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighbor despite US sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there", Erdogan said in New York, where he attended the UN General Assembly.
But Erdogan admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil because some companies had "withdrawn because of the US threats".
The Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticised US sanctions against Iran in the past, said that Turkey would "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this issue and many other issues".
The US has pursued a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since it withdrew from the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
The sanctions have led to a fall in Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to restrict refugee admission
The US government wants to drastically limit the number of refugees it accepts. The US State Department said on Thursday that the annual cap on a resettlement program would be reduced from the current 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, a 40 percent cut.
The State Department said that while the United States remains committed to helping refugees, its primary mission is to protect and serve U.S. citizens, and that the U.S. immigration system is currently overwhelmed.
The US government intends to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and have been endangered by it, according to the State Department statement.
The program, which was established in 1980, will select refugees from UN camps around the world and resettle them in the U.S. The cap of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 fiscal year would be the lowest in the program's history, down from the current cap of 30,000.
Aid agencies reacted with horror to the announcement of the lowering of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America", said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband, adding that the US would further undermine its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to limit immigration to the United States, both legal and illegal, and the U.S. government is expecting 350,000 asylum seekers for the next fiscal year, separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "He is getting close to a snitch"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage in the Whistleblower Affair. Whoever gave the whistleblower who accused him of abuse of power information "is close to a snitch", Trump said in a recording of a private meeting in New York on Thursday, according to multiple US media reports.
Trump was speaking to staff at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and when asked who had tipped the whistleblower off about controversial White House events, he said, "That's close to a snitch". Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right. Spies and treason, we used to do it a little differently than we do now".
Democrats sharply criticized Trump's remarks, accusing him of witness intimidation and attempting to obstruct a congressional investigation into possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president in a now-published complaint of abusing his office to solicit interference from another country in the 2020 US election. Specifically, it concerns his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: In the conversation, Trump suggested that he launch investigations against his possible Democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump denies any wrongdoing.
It is not yet clear who both the whistleblower and his informants are, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is an analyst for the CIA's foreign intelligence agency.
Refugee boat capsized: Baby and toddler drown in Aegean
The European Union is also committed to the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is a fundamental instrument of the European Union's human rights system, and which is based on the principle of the rule of law, and the principle of the rule of law.
The Greek coastguard has confirmed that seven migrants, including a baby and four other children, died in the sinking of a rubber boat off the Greek island of Chios, after four children, three women and five men were rescued from the waves by the crew of a passing ferry.
The victims included a smuggler, reported the local news portal Alithia.gr. The migrants left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group of Inousses, which is located between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The EU is also calling for the immediate release of all those who have been detained in the country, including those who have been arrested in the past, and for the immediate release of all those who have been detained in the past.

The rental agreement is suddenly suspended: WeWork is shaking up the real estate market
In New York, WeWork has become the largest office meters.
In just a few years, WeWork has gone from a small startup to a driving force in the world's most expensive real estate market, but now the company is in crisis, and landlords are afraid of billions in revenue.
The crisis of the office rental company WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the largest real estate markets in the world. The company had a few days ago removed founder Adam Neumann as head, postponed the planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and securities such as the private jet for the executives to gain financial leeway for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork leases large office space long-term and rents it out in small units to members on short-term terms. These may be individual freelancers, small startups, or entire departments of large corporations. So far WeWork is burning money with this business at a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company incurred a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. This year alone, the rental costs are estimated to have increased to 2.5 billion dollars due to the continuous leasing of new large space.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases with terms of up to 15 years, with liabilities of more than $40 billion, and these huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork leased nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in Manhattan, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the past 24 months. New contracts alone meant that demand for offices in New York was greater than the amount of new space that was on the market at the time. Without WeWork's expansion, office vacancies in the US metropolis would have risen during this time, as Alpert wrote in Business Insider.
The UK's capital could also see its real estate market shifting without further expansion of the aggressive startup. e prime tenant is WeWork, in an office building bought last year by the savings bank fund provider Deka for just under 100 million euros in the centre of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet WeWork's requirements with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off part of the expected billions of revenue. Despite the long-term lease agreements, they do not have access to the - already scarce - reserves of WeWork. Because the rental of the individual WeWork sites is usually carried out by special subsidiaries, so-called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company has only limited liability.
Russia arrested a number of North Korean fishermen again
The Russian coast guard has taken action against North Korean fishermen again, arresting 262 more poachers who were fishing illegally in the waters of the country in recent days, Russia's domestic intelligence agency FSB told Interfax on Friday.
The report also stresses that the North Korean regime has not been able to stop the violence, and that the North Korean authorities have not been able to stop the violence, and that the North Korean authorities have not been able to stop the violence.
The North Korean fishermen were reportedly in Russian territorial waters, where the Russian coast guard patrols to protect its marine biological resources. The new inspections revealed 30,000 squid. Three fishing boats and two motor boats were seized and taken to Nachodka Posjet and near Vladivostok. According to the agency Ria Nowosti, the coast guard detected more than 8,000 violations in 2018.
The Russian fisheries authority also did not issue fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, following complaints from local entrepreneurs.
Georgi Martynow, head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Primorye Region, recently complained about the environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who used tightly woven synthetic nets, which are banned in Russia, to catch small creatures and then simply dump them in the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
The Russian border guards detained a North Korean boat on 17 September, and then a second boat after it opened fire.
US imposes entry ban on former President Castro
The United States has imposed an entry ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, citing Castro's involvement in "gross human rights abuses" as the head of the Communist Party in the Caribbean country, and a system in which thousands of Cubans are arbitrarily detained and more than 100 political prisoners.
"The Cuban regime's violation of human rights and use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", tweeted US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued travel bans on Venezuelan government and military officials, among others. Venezuela has been in a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help the opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of medical personnel sent to it.According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate tests by Fridays for Future
A week after the biggest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are taking to the streets today to demand more climate action.
The Fridays for Future movement is planning to hold a series of actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world to end an international climate strike week. Due to the time difference, the protests are expected to start in New Zealand and Australia before spreading across Europe to North America.
"Last Friday, over four million people went on strike for the climate. This Friday we're doing it again!" she tweeted. So far, there have been 6,383 actions in 170 countries during the strike week, she added.
The number of people who took part in the protests was particularly high in Germany last Friday, with Fridays for Future estimating that more than a third of the world's protesters - around 1.4 million - took part in the protests in 575 German cities.
In August 2018, at the age of 15, Thunberg sat in front of the Swedish Parliament to call on the politicians of her country to make a greater commitment to climate protection.
The European Union is also calling for a new round of negotiations to be held on the future of the EU's energy policy, which will be based on the principle of 'a single market', and to be based on the principle of 'a single market'.
Thunberg had arrived in New York a little over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour on a high-sea racing yacht. She had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional speech at the UN, in which she persuasively convinced the world's heads of state and government. In her home city of Stockholm, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Foundation's Alternative Nobel Prize on Wednesday for her commitment to more climate protection.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on balconies. This will change fire safety regulations. "This also applies to smoking", a spokesman for the Ministry of Emergency Situations told the Tass news agency in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is to take effect on October 1.
The Ministry of the Interior has announced that the ban on smoking cigarettes will be lifted if the cigarette is used to start a fire, and that it will be punished by a fine of 3,000 rubles ($42.46) if it is used to light a fire.
The attack on cybercriminals - investigators take out servers
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time identified a major server provider for illegal transactions on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of having hosted numerous websites as the operator of a computer centre in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach on the Mosel, through which international criminals operated their machinations.
The prosecutor's office in Koblenz has announced the arrest of seven suspects in a major operation on Thursday night.
The attack on 1.25 million telecom routers in late November 2016 was also controlled via a server in the cyber bunker, according to the Prosecutor General's Office.
The Commission was informed that the Commission had received a complaint from a German company, the German National Bank, concerning the alleged infringement of the competition rules.
The raid, which was supported by special forces such as the GSG9, was the result of almost five years of investigation, and the investigators plan to provide further details at noon.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests ever, today tens of thousands of people are once again taking to the streets to demand more climate action.
To conclude an international week of climate strike, Fridays for Future is planning actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large-scale rally in Montreal, Canada.
Climate protests  Who are Thunberg's people?
Justice and courage are great virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world of war and smoke factories that are heating the climate. It is all the more amazing that a 16-year-old girl of all people is holding the man of power in this era in contempt. But what is behind it? Is it helpfulness or clever marketing of a climate activist? Historical masterpiece or manipulative tactics for its own sake?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg is moving the masses and getting young people to rise up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in history in Europe that a young person manages to win a group of children and young people for himself. Already in the year 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt outcast to fight for a fairer world. At that time, he also won a group of young people for himself and persuaded them to cross the sea to get to the promised land, similar to Greta Thunberg recently made the trip to America with a sailboat.
But there is a dark side to this? Why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers at her side. By the way, her mother has published a book that has sold widely thanks to her daughter in the limelight. Even long-time followers of Greta Thunberg were a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip by boat was probably too thick for some followers. This is not without reason, because the stock was very well received in the media worldwide and a lot of money flowed thanks to the stock.
Here the minds now differ: Is it morally right to enrich oneself financially while saving the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stockbrokers during the world saving action? No matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives on different opinions and discussions. Therefore it can make sense to question critically even seemingly pious plans of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossing our solar system
An alien comet is currently passing through our solar system.
Astronomers have confirmed that an alien comet is passing through our solar system - only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, scientists have only guessed, but now they know for sure: A comet from another star is crossing our solar system at this moment, named after its discoverer, 2I/Borisov, and it's currently engaging astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in the Crimea
The object in question was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov in the Crimea. He looked up at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his initial suspicion. It is indeed an unknown comet not from our solar system. It is only the second of its kind to be seen in transit.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to get a close-up view of an alien solar system. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the Canary Islands Astrophysical Institute. The comet is clearly of interstellar origin, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC), and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbolic orbit that is leading it out of our system.
Comet spotted before approach - and can be observed for several months
Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been sighted on its approach, which means that it can be observed from Earth for many months. "It will reach its maximum brightness in mid-December and will be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of the U.S. space agency NASA. "After that, it will be visible only with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
The first findings of comet 2I/Borisov give hope to science
The comet is estimated to be between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter, according to preliminary observations, and the object appears to be similar to our comet, because, as IAC researcher Julia de León put it, the spectrum of the comet is similar to ours.
The discovery of two such objects in just two years may open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids have always been a topic of interest to scientists, and recently a giant asteroid passed Earth's surface in a dangerously close approach.
"Absolutely despicable": Rachel Johnson is horrified by her brother's death
Boris Johnson is getting more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is using clear words to slam the Prime Minister's belligerent language as "in tasteless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "fraud", "contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is getting more and more ready - at least verbally.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words such as surrender as if opponents of an EU exit should be "hung, drawn, quartered, gagged and stuffed". She said that this was highly reprehensible.
She was particularly struck by her brother's mention of Jo Cox, an EU-friendly MP who was murdered by a neo-Nazi days before the 2016 Brexit referendum, whose memory could best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It's very distasteful to refer to a member of parliament who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first,'" Johnson's sister criticized. "The perpetrator obviously came from the far-right camp, which feels empowered by 'this kind of language,' and for all those who mourned for them, it's very distasteful".
Cox's widower also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick to see Jos's name used in this way", he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be passionate and determined about what you believe - no matter what your views. But never "demonize the other side". He also lamented that an atmosphere had been created in which attacks had become more likely.
Just a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo had resigned as Secretary of State and as a Tory MP. "I have been torn between family loyalty and the national interest in recent months - it's an unresolvable tension", said Jo Johnson.
Johnson's speech also drew sharp criticism from the Church, with the Times reporting that all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticized the language as "not worthy of this country".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performing at the Super Bowl
In the year of its 100th anniversary, the NFL is making a strong statement by announcing that two women of Latino descent will appear on the Super Bowl halftime show, promising "a burst of fun and energy".
Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will host the halftime show at the upcoming NFL Championship game, organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community alongside JLo, because they have incredible strength in the U.S"., Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American Football League, which will celebrate its 100th anniversary next year, will be held on February 2 in Miami, a city on the southern tip of Florida that is home to many people with Latin American roots.
"I love that the Super Bowl is bringing two women on stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez said, sending an important message to all Americans and the world that the show will be "a blast of fun and energy".
Lopez, 50, was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a telenovela star and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and the single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the USA every year. This year many also interpreted the selection as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump.
The Super Bowl is the largest sporting event in the United States and at the same time a gigantic advertising spectacle. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones caused a sensation there. As a rule, more than 100 million television viewers watch the NFL final, it is also extremely popular in Germany.
The controversy was triggered by the refusal of quarterback Colin Kaepernick to stand up during the playing of the national anthem in protest against police violence against black people, which was met with harsh criticism from US President Donald Trump, among others.
Actor and Youtuber accuses Egypt's ruler of being a "spoiler": Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad for now.
The two men who have the power to make blood flow again on the streets of Egypt spent the past week both abroad. One of them swam back to Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general who in 2013 deposed the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had vowed to be careful with political Islam and lost no silver coins over human rights violations on the Nile - in a week in which Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people for not protesting against the president. "He said that the Egyptian airports had caused the Iranian refugees to fear the state of Egypt".
The 45-year-old actor was known only to a minority of Egyptians weeks ago, but now he is the voice that dominates the political discourse in the country's cafes, apartments and tea rooms: with his YouTube channel, "Mohamed Ali's Secrets", Ali is calling on his countrymen to rise up against Sisi.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president revels in luxury and builds magnificent new palaces, it says. The military leadership, on which Sisi bases his rule, Ali accuses of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a contractor, he seems to know quite exactly what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the click counts that are about to explode show.
Last week, after thousands of people demonstrated against his rule for the first time since Sisi took power, and almost 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" on Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would actually take to the streets. But there were sporadic smaller protests, for example in Gisheh near Cairo and in China near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests whose participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure.
In the city of Mansura in the Nile Delta, where protesters tore apart banners bearing the portrait of the president last week, a massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the exit roads. In Cairo, several metro stations were closed for "maintenance work" in the city center, most of the streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in Rabaa Square, where in 2013 supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood gathered in the mud, the army opened fire on them and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent the unrest from spreading: the Zukunf Sisene party wanted to hold a large gathering for the president here.
Mohamed Ali's precautions prompted a change in his tactics: "Our target doesn't have to be Tahrir Square", Ali told his video camera in Barcelona. "Let's not clash with police officers". But this is not a retreat: "Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways of checking.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment in the event of accidents at work, which is to be incorporated into the Treaty of Amsterdam.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the Consumer Centre of Bavaria.
If the connection always seems much slower than advertised by the provider, there are several ways of checking the connection: the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to the specifications of the supplier and are therefore not uniformly and objectively calculated", the Consumer Centre of Bavaria points out.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of time, usually 14 days, to deliver the promised service.
If the customer does not receive any compensation, even after several requests, he can cancel the contract and, in some cases, claim damages, but if he does not receive any compensation, he can only appeal.
First ranking Republican to be investigated
The governor of Vermont has become the first senior Republican to speak out in favor of an impeachment inquiry against US President Donald Trump. "I think the inquiry is important, yes, and where it goes from here will be determined by the facts that are established", Phil Scott said at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before any action is taken - an impeachment inquiry can lead to the impeachment of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden's interventions in Ukraine, as Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few showing any discomfort at the outcome.
Spider-Man remains in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it was announced that Sony and Marvel will go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore no longer be part of the "Avengers" universe. It was completely unclear how the films about Tom Holland should continue.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).
Screenrant quotes Marvel boss Kevin Feige as saying, "I'm thrilled that Spidey's path continues in the MCU. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are thrilled that we can continue to work on it ... He's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidey universe. You never know what the future will bring".
The company is reportedly considering a deal with Marvel, which is said to be the largest company in the industry, to give Disney, which also owns Marvel, a 30% stake in the upcoming Spider-Man films.
This is how Meghan and Prince Harry look in the finale of "Suits"
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the USA has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked for many years in the series, was charmingly paid tribute. Attention, the following sections contain spoilers for the series finale.
And to start with, Duchess Meghan didn't return for a final farewell as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes, but instead, some flashbacks showed the most memorable scenes with the current Duchess, such as the moments of her failed and successful marriage to Mike or how she greets him after his prison sentence.
However, her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. As Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) is walking down the aisle to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht, 47) makes a revealing remark about his outfit.
Aegean Sea: Baby and four other children drown in boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while anchoring a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea, killing seven people in total, the Greek coastguard said Friday, though the nationalities of the victims were still unclear.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The European Parliament has voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of taxation on the sale of tobacco products, which would allow the Commission to make a more effective contribution to the common agricultural policy.
Seehofer, who was also the EU's foreign minister, said he had been in Athens for a week to "inform Turkey about the situation of refugees" and to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in order to help them cope.
A spokeswoman for the EU Commission confirmed on Friday that Seehofer was planning to travel with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Home Affairs Minister Christophe Castaner.
Greece continues to see an unusually high number of migrants arriving from Turkey, with 654 people being transferred to the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still on?
The increase in numbers has recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey deal, signed in 2016, which allows the EU to return all refugees and migrants arriving illegally via Turkey to the Greek islands, in return for which the EU wanted to take in one Syrian refugee from Turkey for every one deported.
The Commission has also been asked to examine the possibility of implementing the new rules on the protection of the financial interests of the Union in the event of a serious infringement of the rules on competition, in particular as regards the protection of the financial interests of the Union's financial interests.
The number of refugees in Turkey has never been higher since the EU-Turkey refugee pact came into force in March 2016, state radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "quite definitely" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society of Cardiology. High temperatures and large temperature jumps in the cardiovascular system in particular caused a rise in heart attacks in a short period of time.
Green politician to answer for embarrassing photo incident
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election campaign - was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The Canadian Green leader is pictured holding a disposable cup in her hand, but now it's out that the cup has been tampered with.
The reusable coffee cup with metal straw was never held in the hand of Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website, she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also circulated to the media - and the cup was still a schnoeder (papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green Leader to answer for photo failure
The National Post accused May of manipulating the party and producing fake news to make the party more credible on environmental issues, amid a House of Commons election campaign that is also plaguing Trudeau over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media, fueling the discussion about fake news. One user shares a contrast of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairman to hide their disposable cup".
May expressed her shock and insisted on her blog that she knew nothing about this action. To emphasize this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, the right one, she said, was made of bamboo. She always had it with her. A spokeswoman of the party said that it was only to cover the Parago part in the picture, and not to cover up something.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she tells the Guardian, and asks her over-committed team, "If they want to edit a picture again, can they do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also been hit by shitstorms over their use of single-use plastics or air travel - but their pictures were not photoshopped.
Influencerin wants free upgrade: Lifetime ban from Cathay
Jaqueline Ng had allegedly received a letter from Cathay Pacific promising her an upgrade, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was denied boarding - and she should never be allowed to fly with Cathay again.
To get a spontaneous upgrade to business class, which is the dream of many passengers, sometimes you get lucky and the staff at check-in offers you a free transfer from economy class.
But this case shows how not to do it: A self-proclaimed influencer actively asked Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. Jaqueline Ng has over 65,000 followers on Instagram. She flew from Taiwan to New York on May 30 and back on June 7.
On the way in, Jaqueline was denied an upgrade by her staff, despite showing an email to her allegedly suggesting an upgrade by Cathay Pacific, which the influencer claims was sent to her by a marketing employee of the airline, who accused Jaqueline of forging the email.
On the return flight, Jacqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-haul flight, this time the woman allegedly showed the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK airport were skeptical: they checked with the central office. And in fact, the employee from whom the email allegedly came, allegedly cut off contact with Jacqueline by mail. This was also confirmed by the mail system, in which the messages did not appear.
Airline officials at the airport canceled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on her from Cathay Pacific, forcing her to buy a new ticket to Taiwan for $1,400.
The influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a consumer advocacy firm, for help with her case, because while Cathay had reimbursed her the price of her original ticket, Jaqueline was also claiming the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline doesn't submit the email metadata, the case is clear: Cathay believes the influencer committed fraud, she is banned from future flights, and the airline's terms of service state that she doesn't have to pay for the new flight.
Oil prices fall after report of ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time on Friday afternoon. The latest price was a barrel (159 liters) of the North Sea variety Brent at $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The move was triggered by a Wall Street Journal report on a ceasefire in Yemen, which Saudi Arabia is said to have agreed to in four areas.
A drone attack on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities in mid-September halted five percent of global oil production. Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia and the US government have blamed Iran. A ceasefire would ease political tensions in the region.
If a deal is reached, the focus could be on growth and demand, Ole Hansen, head of Saxo Bank's commodity strategy department, told Bloomberg.
The price of oil is continuing its downward trend of the past few days, with WTI oil costing almost 59 dollars a barrel a week ago, and Brent oil costing almost 65 dollars a barrel.
Bloomberg recently reported, citing insiders, that oil repair work in Saudi Arabia is progressing faster than expected after the mid-September attack, and that production has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back toward the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press reports citing insiders reporting rapid progress by the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco in repairs, but crude oil experts point out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning an IPO and wants to avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relief in the conflict between Iran and the West: The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after being detained by Iran and recently granted permission. The crew is now preparing for departure, while the ship remains at anchor, the ship's captain Erik Hånell told Swedish radio on Friday morning in an SMS.
However, the US has announced that it will deploy missiles and troops to Iran's arch-enemy Saudi Arabia, and fears of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the US and the UK have driven oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
Accusations against Trump intensify
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of collusion against the White House have become loud. Several senior government officials have intensively tried to prevent access to the transcript of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the end of July. This was explained by an anonymous whistleblower. The speaker of the House of Representatives, the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, explicitly accused the White House of "collusion". Trump spoke of a "witch hunt".
North Korea sees Trump and Kim's third summit as doubtful
North Korea has cast doubt on whether a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will take place soon, citing the lack of progress in implementing the agreements reached at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The EU is also calling for the release of all those who have been detained in the UK for more than a year, including those who have been arrested in the UK, and for the release of all those who have been detained in the UK for more than a year.
Trump said on Monday that he would like to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he declares himself ready to do so. Negotiations on disarming North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February. In June, the two met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the talks, but so far without much success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
In a blue vest, the British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a land mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he set the firing circle. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later asked in front of the TV cameras: "I call on all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but who did not help in cleaning up, to commit to help".
Pound under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
The pound is losing value against the euro in the face of a coming rate cut.
Speculation about a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut is boosting sterling.
The sales were triggered by comments from the central bank's chief executive Michael Saunders, who suggested a rate cut even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as the uncertainty will affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the strain on the economy from the Brexit hiccup without directly signaling a rate cut. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country out of the EU on October 31st, if necessary, even without a divorce agreement.
Moreover, the British Prime Minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off for him, says Kerstin Leitel, editor of the Handelsblatt.
Russia's doping: further Russian manipulation proved
The Moscow analysis laboratory is being manipulated, according to David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and now head of integrity at the World Athletics Federation.
As the World Athletics Championships kick off, new details emerge about the doping scandal in Russia - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sports had gained at the beginning of the year, and only partially regained.In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).Now it turned out: they were falsified.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA had banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee allowed around 270 athletes from the country to compete under a neutral flag at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio after an individual test, and 168 Russian athletes were at the start at the Winter Games in February 2018.
Positive findings are missing
The following September, WADA lifted the ban on Rusada, but demanded access to the lab and the samples it had collected, which would reveal the extent of the cover-up of doping cases in the state doping system and help punish athletes after the fact.
The chairman of the IAAF's Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow analysis laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the task force received the correct data", said David Howman in an interview with the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have found numerous discrepancies between the data received from a whistleblower and the data received from the Russen in January". Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
Not affected by the World Cup
This confirms the position of the IAAF: the athletics federation is the only organization that is sticking to the Russian ban. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they train and undergo tests outside the Russian system.
Earlier this week, Wada revealed the manipulations and asked Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks, and Russia now threatens to ban Rusada again, and in the worst case, to ban it from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
