Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday in Gutach the new B 33 footwear lamp has been taken into operation at the village parking area - in view of the oldest municipality lamp.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shield strike?
The mayor of Gutach answered this question clearly yesterday.
“The municipal sample was then installed because it ensures the schoolway,” Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lamp saves both cyclists and bus passengers and the inhabitants of Bergle.
The facility officially operated yesterday is important for the cruise area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, cur park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ‘Grub’.
"In the high traffic and pedestrian rise, another lamp had to come to their safety," Eckert said.
This is confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Council Office.
“At current measurements on the B 33 daily about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach, of which about ten percent are heavy-load traffic,” Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: “Security is just going on here,” Arnold said.
In total, four traffic surveys were carried out, a circle traffic was also planned, but due to the narrowness in the crossroads area of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße was rejected.
According to Arnold, it was all tested in the location selection of the lampmasters before: "By an extra for us with long wood stems loaded carrier, we have tested whether these vehicles can run from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without switching the lampmaster."
The approximately 15,000 euro expensive lighting plant itself is “the most modern one that is currently on the market,” Arnold explained.
The facility is equipped with colourful LEDs that shine so strongly that the lights from the drivers are well recognizable, for example, even when the sun stands deep.
And it is also safer: the older lighting plants consume about 100 watt, the new just eight watt.
There are three lighting facilities per route.
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the lamp button, the upper radar sensor will test the traffic condition.
If the road is free, it comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor examines whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
“If a group or people with disabilities should go over the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely through the trail,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver must think here as a partner and watch the trail.
This was not the case yesterday: hardly the light showed green for pedestrians, a top-class vehicle passed through - with bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has written the need of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood – the speechlessness, the hang of raw violence and stupid sexuality, the narrowness and unpleasantness – has been described by the Kärntner poet many times.
The Booker Prize winner is known primarily as Prosaa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Waterlight on the Zungenspitze", which is now visible in the X Garage on the Petersplatz, therefore a collage from Prosatexten together.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the widespread empty stage - an important requisit: a scratched sofa, on which it is copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
Regisseur Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance exceeds the show with a lot of directing hits, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses are involved in somewhat controversial scenic translations.
They are hard attached, drowned with the head under water, covered with their evening robes to the wall.
Inserted in cellophan or mider, they stumble on dangerously high holes through the inscenation, either monologize them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly communicated in this striking way.
The best moments are the evening when it is singed - the band range ranges from Deep Purple to popular song.
At the end, the exaggerated performance comes somewhat calm, and Winkler’s absurd humor blows up.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that finds a place in the armature board of each car.
The devices that record each kilometre travelled and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the outdated system for funding U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colourful allies.
Liberals have joined environmental groups and promised that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometers that were driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax decisions.
The tea party is disappointed.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while Congress cannot agree on one action, several states do not wait anymore.
They are currently considering how they can switch to a system over the next ten years with the driver paying per mile riding.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the road recorders, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s nothing that we’re only likely to use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, CEO of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the mile travelled with all California car drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
Technology is there for that.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that U.S. Americans pay off on the Zapsoule, is broken.
In America, however, there is no longer as much praise as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians don’t dare to raise the tax even for a cent.
“The fuel tax is simply not sustainable,” says Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with travel writers to test a mile-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
The bureaucrates call it a mill-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea finds an appeal to urban liberals, for the tax can be used, for example, to influence driving behavior in a way that reduces stain and climate-threatening emissions.
The California planners rely on the system in developing strategies to the ambitious, legally established objectives of the Federal State on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most common long-term alternative.
Reason Foundation’s free marketers are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay on the back track.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” says Adrian Moore, Vice President for Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move towards a mile-based billing.
The US Senate approved a $90 million-cost pilot project that would include 10,000 cars last year.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the protest and responded to the concerns of parliamentarians from rural areas, representing people who often have to walk many miles in their daily lives on the way to work or to the city.
However, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering this.
Illinois tests it in a limited extent with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Fears about Big Brother and such things were a big problem,” says Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Nevada Ministry of Transportation.
The people didn’t want it.
As the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the travel scriptors into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a giant, blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states now looking for affordable technology with which the state can capture the kilometers run, but not exactly when and where.
Thus, according to Khan, the public would be more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not act to help the states in taxing car drivers.
Instead, it was their goal to step in a emerging car insurance market where drivers should pay on the basis of the mile they drive.
However, the devices they test are also interesting for road planners because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded through modem.
“People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made great mistakes.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a fixed fee based on the average miles driven by all inhabitants of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept to a suspicious public by exhibiting the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that allows you to pay parking fees, a insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometers, and speed data is collected from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can escape stays.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers,” it says in a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction maneuver.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax.
An additional single fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gas, so that they also pay a fair share.
“There’s no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Kingfield: The small team is struggling
The volunteer firefighters dealt with their autumn head test despite staff failures with Bravour.
Only 11 people took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had selected the property in the Burgberger Straße in his practice.
There should be a short summary.
Due to the fire and smoke, two people were injured, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two firearms were prepared to enter the building after Hans Kammerer's first review of the situation.
After a short time, it managed to find the first person and lead it out.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stain for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electric machinery for wood processing.
The first shooting took place through the tank in the vehicle.
Another direction was carried out through an overflow hydrant at about 100 meters away.
Three bombings have been launched.
There was also a firewall in the building.
Hans Kammerer went to show during the exercise what to do with little available staff.
In serious cases, a support is made through the day-to-day operation group Königsfeld.
The officer was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies is important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald countryside, Landtag president Guido Wolf also found out in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Supportive Center of Hochschwarzwald, he went together with the chief school leaders of the Professional Schools and the Circuit Gymnasium and the chairman of the Parental Council on this important question.
“Education is an important location factor,” stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the connected school project High Black Forest Education Center.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in Wälderstadt between the Funding Centre, the Circuit Gymnasium and the Professional School Centre.
He also praised the family friendship in the countryside.
“It’s important to have in mind not only the family phase, but because of the demographic change also the phase about the care of the family,” Wolf explained.
He also suggested that more and more employees take care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the benefits of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills often remain retained by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," he said.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the professional needs could also be covered.
According to him, the location advantage of the region is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg he experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public passenger transport.
“Continue to be persistent and ensure that public transportation is better,” he said to the address of the municipal politicians present.
A fun afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
Earlier, the elderly citizens were brought to the residence.
This afternoon will be held in St. Joseph’s Nursery.
The inhabitants were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was a salad.
With popular melodies, Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked.
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front departure of the old school court before the renovation to the church road is to be put again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, in the first works of the repair of the front school hall, a small corner wall was built for the stabilization and statistic discharge of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The further action is planned, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger City Building Office, to incorporate the Land Memorial Office into the plannings and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by professionals, which will then be placed on the table for the council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision about this is expected to be made in the coming year.
After the renovation, plantation and tree plantation of the old school interior within the two sidelines of the school built in 1912, it is necessary, in anticipated time as a follow-up, to restore the restraint wall from the ground to the ground and to put on a new underground.
The historic, a hundred-year-old border wall of the old school court to the church street, is mainly due to water and frozen damage, since there is no drainage, repair needed, and has a tenderness forward.
Deep scratches in individual stones show weather damage, however, the wall is currently not in danger of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of the students to use school courtyard, which is done through the current fixing work.
Initially, the school repair was planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned spending brought a shift.
An important word in the historic school wall repair, which has already been used even for filming, will be spoken by the National Monument Office.
If the provisions come from this page, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for subsidies from the monument guards.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now taught again in a well-rehabilitated old school building with new halls, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal Chairman of the Greens, is now involved.
“I think it’s wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart High School of Music,” Özdemir told “Stuttgarter Nachrichten”.
Jazz and classics belong together at the Stuttgart Jazz Stadium.
Thus, Özdemir, which in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag elections on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red Country Government.
Based on an expert study, this requires a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
After that, among other things, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music College to the Mannheim Music College.
U.S. border: ‘Super Tunnel’ Discovered
On the border between Mexico and the United States, detectives have discovered and stumbled a "super tunnel" to the drug bug.
As the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railways and an ventilation facility.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
“These cartels are foolish if they think they could be buried under the radar,” said Southern California Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel was discovered.
Duffy said, “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a lasting struggle against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Due to the heavy equipment of the tunnel, the researchers assume that it was built by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The station was equipped in such a way that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a route leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a crossing of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the marijuana captured.
All three are threatened as the maximum punishment of lifelong imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it was said at a press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnels.
This shows the “desperation” of the drug bands, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman from the drug research DEA in San Diego.
They would do everything to get to the United States.
No details were about the detainees, at least one of them were Mexicans, it said.
You have to expect a prison sentence of up to ten years.
2014 is Geisinger's year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The return of the first specific mention is getting closer.
If the year ends in about eight weeks, the anniversary year is up.
The gathering and church houses were named together for the first time for 794 times.
In the churches a document was made, in which both places are mentioned.
On March 15th, an official inauguration of the anniversary year is scheduled, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this inauguration event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in churches-hauses.
A number of events are planned as part of the anniversary, both in gathering and in church houses.
The church houses will be in July at a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Celebrating the return.
On Friday with a celebration, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall.
This weekend is also the Church-House Church Festival.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be listed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Black Forest Association's Sunrise Feast, on 12 July in the Arena with Fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and announced in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger City Anniversary, a new chronicle is also published.
“But it should become a chronicle not only of the hostages themselves, but a printed work on the hostages of today, which consists of hostages, church houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen,” said mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's gathering celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was performed with the commissions.
The new Chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is a year with many celebrations.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a consumption evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and has the festive banket on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Old Town of Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been on the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Music Association of Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the framework of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document, which is in possession of the Monastery of St. Gallen, in 764 for the first time.
The document was made in churches (houses), which at the time was a court place.
Both municipalities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason 2014 to celebrate this 1250th anniversary accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform remains 40 years behind.
The Council takes the trains into vision
Should the "Am Hirschen" railway transit be hardly rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
The municipalities have decided.
Schiltach must take in hand 220,000 euros.
Deutsche Bahn plans to improve the Kinzigtal-Bahn route next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety on rail passes - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must participate with a third of the costs, the rest are shared by rail and federation.
Schiltach City Builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the peculiarities of the train passage "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an exhaust at the height of the tunnel mountain west of the railway line.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those carrying long wood, could be on counter traffic without having to block the trail.
Therefore, Greßhauer proposed to build a necessary support wall so that the city could spread the next road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was discussed controversially in the council, as some councils doubted the need for a road spread: Thomas Kipp brought with his statement the mood of the critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas opposed: The "Hirschen" railway transit is regularly used for long wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported through this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long would not be able to use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they would not be able to move to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a conversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
Therefore, considering that the Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnels need to be rebuilt and rebuilt, as this is currently the case in Wolfach, the "Am "Hirschen" railway transition could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to investigate what costs the projected spread of the road would cause.
Nevertheless, the reconstruction of the railway transit was majorityly agreed with the provision that the necessary support walls will be built in such a way that the city can extend the subsequent road to the "Bahnhofstraße" where appropriate for meeting traffic to approximately 5.5 meters.
The rebuilding of the railway transit at the Gerberei Trautwein could, on the contrary, cause a completely different problem that affects the arrival in the strongly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had made the train rebuilding plans to be investigated by the engineering office of Breinlinger, as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was still possible.
The investigation came to the conclusion that it is not to be excluded that the tendency of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit up.
The city is responsible for this as a road-building carrier.
The restructuring could result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood exports and the drainage worked in the current state of development, we should not agree to the reconstruction of the railway transition, Haas argued.
At this point, the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition should also be significantly lower than on the other railway passes, because the stop point is located directly next to the centre, with which there is a good vision connection.
Even trains from the main railway station should be so blocked at this point that there is no collision.
Mostly, the approval for the rebuilding of this railway transit was rejected, as the city of Schiltach had to "dismantle" the problem with seating vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
As unproblematic, the Gremium considers the renovations on the railway passages "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which already cross-section agreements with the railway have been concluded.
Esa Decides on Large Space Missions: Missions for Billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - Experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
The Far Worlds.
More than 1,000 planets on other stars have already been discovered by astronomers.
If there is life at least on some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or rather to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or traveling to Earth-like planets and thus discovering alien life?
These questions are asked by the European space agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are aimed at promoting research.
The cost for such “L-missions” is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the European space research elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were discussed, five of which have now come into the closer choice.
Numerous agencies reviewed the proposals and followed the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Program Committee.
In total, four major questions have been selected by the Esa, to which the missions of the 2007 initiated Cosmic Vision program will find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The accurate processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds – and thus the formation of planets that surround these stars – are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in the whole could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star possesses a planet, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To address this question, the 2017 space telescope "Cheops" will be launched, using which 500 already known planetary systems in our closer surroundings will be further investigated.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of €150 million.
With larger instruments, astronomers could imagine Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately give an explanation of what conditions there are for the formation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that comes from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission (this is the budget of about half a billion euros) for this question.
The son is scheduled to launch in 2017 and to monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest for the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what the role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa is presenting the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program.
Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the ice moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The space offers many ways to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there.
Per there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How was the universe created and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created through the Urknall.
In addition to the matter we have, from the stars, planets and living beings we exist, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together, and dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
Until now, the researchers don’t know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the urnall, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With Euclid, the Esa has already approved a M mission, which is scheduled to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the satellite will first explore the distribution of matter in the universe throughout the sky, allowing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could run the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
The best chances for an approval as a L-Mission, according to many experts, "E-Lisa" has a demanding concept for detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists understand the changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted 100 years ago.
They have not been demonstrated until today.
Elisa could this, hoping the scientists behind the project.
The mission predicts a detector consisting of two or three sonds, which is stationed in the all.
It could, unlike plants on Earth, also prove gravitational waves that have emerged during the Urknall, and thus provide new insights about the formation of the cosmos.
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is intended to explore and explore earth-like planets.
Proposals for sample back transportation from Mars, for the exploration of moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics are already excluded.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence service, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and declare before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander don’t give any answers about their activities.
German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, she writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was proved positive, my government continues to treat a deviant opinion as a breakthrough of loyalty and tries to criminalize political statements with a threat of punishment, where no defense is possible.”
But saying the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop the charges against him.
The accusations brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, then we will find ways to enable that.”
Relations between the U.S. and Germany are loaded by the allegations that the NSA has heard the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said it should be taken the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if possible, “without dangering him and completely ruining the relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele said Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country, according to the former NSA’s lawyer.
If Snowden speaks in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he’s “safe” there, the deputy said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he sees himself exposed to a “hard and ongoing” persecution campaign that has expelled him from his home.
However, he was touched by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines raises fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to save their hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in the Wednesday announcement that passengers should keep the whole dosage.
The new fee applies for hand baggage in the baggage box above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would be charged $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for passengers who had only paid at the flight.
Border spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she said.
In 2008, airlines began to demand fees for the first and second packaged luggage.
Therefore, passengers trying to overcome these have stopped in the hand luggage as much as possible, resulting in the fact that the luggage on the seat is often overfilled.
Taxes are a way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee is not really about making money.
It’s about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who would have clearly expressed that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the field over the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the airport of Frontier may be allowed to take a baggage for free, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures will be changed so that passengers will be informed of the fee before they arrive on the air.
Frontier’s new handbagage fee will enter into force only in the summer, with no exact date yet.
Passengers often cheat about baggage shots and other fees, but airlines are pleased to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street see the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of flights after years of losses.
However, the majority so far leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first charges for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap fighter.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline adviser Jay Sorensen, who is carefully monitoring the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand-package fee would bring $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a lead position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him at the flight climb if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual handbaggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the most unpleasant I’ve experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see toothbrushes and hands-on discussions at the airplane.
“The airplane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was like smiled.”
Frontier follows Spirit also for the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole dose and coffee will be filled back for free.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had tried to demand money for refreshing drinks for a short time in 2008, but it turned back seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company had moved away.
Frontiers step to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative with which customers should be linked to their own website.
Online travel agencies such as Orbitz pay $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This encourages all companies to move passengers for direct purchases with them rather than through an online travel agency.
The border is the most distant in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half as many multi-flight miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were again shortened to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked by a third-party provider with boundaries over 1000 miles will therefore bring customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also book places exclusively on the website of Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal customer family at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company loses money.
The earnings dropped by 9 percent and the flight capacity dropped by 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier in control as part of the company’s sale.
Words come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last female breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the congregation house was “speech words from the Bible” and “speech words from the Middle Ages”.
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the Church Council, went into a lecture on the biblical speech after breakfast.
“Speech words contain life wisdom, rules or warnings,” she said.
She compared several speech words with the corresponding biblical places and explained the meaning.
She spoke the words like: "Be vigilant, as scratches fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, whom the Lord gives in sleep, and wash his hands in innocence."
Several times the speaker also advised his listeners about what speech it was.
Christel Dehner said: All good things are three, making blue, something hiding.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called "bridges into the past."
At the end, a Tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously drawn up before they were delivered to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round mixed the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for unlearned in tourism
On the Mecklenburg Lake Plate today started a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who already work as uneducated in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and hostels over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the work agency of Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants will not be unemployed, the companies will receive trained professionals that are increasingly lacking in hotels and hostels, and the agency will not have to fund unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says an “internal error” and not hackers are guilty of the site crash
The shadowful National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake has scattered their public website for hours and not hackers, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency said in an email message.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server tracker noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that for some users it was still unavailable.
A spokesman for the NSA had previously told ABC News that the authority’s sensitive internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have scattered the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site will be overflowed with page quotes until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber tactics is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose headline once was No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharp criticism after the reveals that have become known in recent months about its extensive monitoring program in and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disappointed former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the intelligence agency triggered initial speculations that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of unemployed people in October was slightly decreased by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and even better than in September, “but we’d have hoped more,” says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy business chief of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
So far, many companies have responded to the behavior of settlements.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer: “We have little professionals in the craftsmanship, healthcare and old-age care.”
As a result of the seasons, since September, jobs offerings for staff in the hotel and hospitality industry are also ongoing.
In the middle of December the winter season begins.
The full background report on this can be found in Allgäuer Anzeigblatt dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Benefits of Bombardier after decrease in delivery rates and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc. a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday after it was under pressure by downturn orders and aircraft delivery in the third quarter as well as contractual problems in the railway part.
Bombardier based in Montreal also did not publish any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule in September.
The new flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago has so far only followed three further starts, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase goes as planned.
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a rate break of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from “outperform” to “sector perform” in terms of that the stock will have a limited rate potential in the next one to two quarters.
“Though weaker shipping numbers were largely expected from aircraft, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program advances for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders will be announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical to the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flown for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new carrier aircraft are true.
Currently there are a total of 403 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Pierre Beaudoin, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also told analysts and media on Thursday that the program is in the schedule.
“The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that during the aircraft’s standing time, ground tests and software updates were set.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then to attach a review period, whatever we did.
This is done throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly afterwards, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after the Jungfernfly the first customer can take a CSeries aircraft into operation.
Bombardier said it will review the implementation plan (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even though it is obviously in line with the internal planning of the bombers – reinforces our view that the launch will be delayed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million and $8 cents per share from $172 million and $9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
The turnover dropped slightly and dropped from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order stock in the air and space department was $32.9 billion on September 30 and was therefore unchanged compared to December 31.
“In the field of air and space, the results were within the framework of our requirements, but the low order input and the market conditions in general were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
The sales in the air and space department fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have risen by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order stock in the transport section was $32.6 billion on September 30 and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to the management, there will be new provisions for the fourth quarter.
In the after-day trade on Thursday, Bombardier’s stock dropped by 8.5 percent and remained at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was also announced that Google’s financial director Patrick Pichette will switch to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the closest rival of bombers, a 10-percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defendant who warned a drug baron before a large police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided the underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on his drug trafficking activity after he was compromised by his own cocaine affection.
The “first-class” lawyer named “Bash” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police had supervised Scarborough, who he had represented in a previous drug proceedings.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a meal at the lawyer's room.
Investigations suggested that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to unlawfully obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a large investigation into heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million and £200,000 in cash during a series of household searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors branch in Blackburn, was found guilty and sentenced at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for disability in justice.
In a previous survey, he confessed the possession of cocaine.
The lawyer was transferred after the police in their investigations against Scarborough found that the lawyer had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two police officers followed the suspect and watched him go to your house and placed the drugs with a 60 percent purity in a black golf gloves under the lawn of the lawyer.
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly called to Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court it was announced that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests found class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but disputed to take cocaine and said he talked to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed that their discussion was subject to the “advocate secret.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were saved and he was taken a hair sample.
During the police interrogation, he said he operates an office both under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him home for legal matters.
In court it was announced that he had called on important drug traffickers, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrestations and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is charged with abuse of his position as a criminal advocate because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The questioning relationship is not simply the one of a drug trader, but of a drug trader who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, as he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He opposed the police investigations as far as possible, so that they could continue to track their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his professional status to appeal.
He stood too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he admitted that his independence was compromised.
Ditta showed every misconduct of herself and claimed: “If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to disclose information to Scarborough, then I’t wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta has made the step from a criminal defendant to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to an unexpected compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has lost that confidence and tries to hide behind the facade of her profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a trial in three cases for possession of cocaine and justice disability, which emphasizes our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy for heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Fifty and thirty other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job is to represent clients as a lawyer in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities are the motivation for his work.
The revolutionary work of church music
To the conclusion of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Dunningen Songkranz will encompass two gods with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
Following the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthusiasmed the spectators in the spring of this year, the Songkranz will enrich two gods at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Messe by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 at the Divine Service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Messe with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Holy Offer of the Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered at the time of its formation almost revolutionary.
The Mass is listed within the framework of the divine services, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider, the chorus is accompanied by the blues group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi an der Orgel.
Skepsy leads to confidence
For example, with the 2015 parish general council elections, the basic things in the soul care unit Haslach (SE) will change.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is nothing to change in the basic decisions of the diocese, and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfying as possible.
Over the course of the day it became clear: the skepticism towards the new disappears deliberately but in the sight of a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive talks of the six departments with the main officials of the Soul Care Team were sufficient.
Regional Dekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the newly adopted guidelines for soul care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
After that, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a body of public law, which is part of the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council, in which the parish power office is represented.
From each parish shall be represented at least two elected members, in which six parishes are formed on the site the so-called community teams.
Their task will be in the future to promote the ecclesiastical life in the place.
In the question of the finances of the individual parish communities, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations show that accumulated funds in the parishes remain targeted.
The obligations are transferred to the general community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then reaches all parishes, there were great concerns.
“In the past, it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone,” relates Haslach’s parish general council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint group for five parishes described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the group in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
In 2006, they had made the task of “to be one, to be five” and had to realize that it wasn’t so easy.
The departments of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then took the effort to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and will be decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, parish mayor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Care Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity is getting more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorfs have to deal with higher electricity costs.
As the chief executive of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SUDKURIER, a four-headed Pfullendorfer family receives an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
A major reason for the upcoming price rise is the rise of the so-called EEG output from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This transformation is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the major railways.
These refers to the extra costs arising from the energy transition, which they can incur by a conversion above the price of electricity.
The city works of Pfullendorf form the last edge in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even expected a higher turnover in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete fees should be calculated before the city buildings can inform their customers about the exact price rise next week.
“We’re going out of an increase of 1 cent plus x,” Bias said, with the number being closer to the 2 cent.
Lights on permanent red: pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a lamp simply doesn’t become green.
The contact slide in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What to do when driving at Red?
If an affected person has been waiting long enough on a red lamp and the cruise is free, he can continue driving, Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "adjusted", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to rest at least five minutes before getting out of a disorder of the lamp.
However, those who continue the journey despite the red light must be aware that they are fully guilty of an accident caused by it.
Those who have less than five minutes of patience may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refer to a decision of the Supreme Court Hamm.
In the case negotiated, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of durable red and had to be responsible for a negligent red light breach.
The lamp was not defective, but soon afterwards turned to green.
A driving ban left him saved because of the special situation - the fine but not.
The City Council is pleased with a solid budget
Every time it comes to the budget in municipal meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has no longer known debts since 2005.
In this regard, the financial year 2012 can also be considered a full success.
This was revealed in the presentation of the annual bill for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with approximately 7.6 million euros has fallen over a million euros higher than planned.
Also the excess of the administrative budget is approximately 1.8 million euros about one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is due primarily to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share in income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it was 2.5 million euros last year.
“This is essentially due to the higher income from the administrative budget,” Rothmund said.
Since there have been fewer investments than planned in the financial year 2012, there is also a higher risk in the backup.
In total, the total rescue could be increased by approximately EUR 2.1 million to now a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and his team for the good work.
"These works are not simply pulled out of the arm," Gerster praised looking at the annual bill.
He and the councils were pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these good numbers could soon be expensive for citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality in the past was able to give up high heights.
However, according to Gerster, the country’s grants have been reduced many times.
For these subsidies from various compensations there are conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for subsidies must show certain heights.
“We have to look at the issue of heights, as in the coming years there will be investments for which we would like to have subsidies,” Gerster said in this context.
Hugo Wermter has been in the chorus for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history is almost twice as long as that of the Herbsfest in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on the stage as usual in the colors of his male singing group.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now more than lovely won chor still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, among others for 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, a pastoral referent on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart Catholic Association, delivered him – since the Chor is also a Church Chor – a document of the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His singer colleagues delivered him the document of the German Chorverband as well as a gravated Zinteller.
In addition to the celebration, the 31st Autumn Festival went on common routes: with the MGV Betra, the Songkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music association, the Fullmaringer had charged a colorful mixture of various chorus and singing styles, which entertained about 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with sounding songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Lustig, your brothers".
For his honorary singer, Hubert Wermter, they prepared for the honor of a little stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing group Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, Far Far" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Pass Through the Valley".
The song chancellor Salzstetten, with his mixed chor and his female group - the "impulschor" - provided the female rate of the festival.
The mixed chorus with the Napolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also grew back to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back with "What is the swob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts "Bierlied" in the hometown, where the Fullmaringer Musicverein offered the crowning musical finish.
For the children there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer launched a Kasperlt theater and read a few stories that the children worked well about lunch.
Children’s dreams become reality
The children's gardens and children's gardens in Zollernalbkreis will receive post in these days.
The Black Forest Bote, in collaboration with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Sparkasse, wants to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and decoration wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, kindergartens and kindergartens from all over the Zollernalbkreis can participate in the event.
If you have a desire for construction or decoration for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest Messengers.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, chooses three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner must take care of many busy construction assistants.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Zollernalb savings.
It is delivered in the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the assistants.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenian press calls for controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves: what stops the Parliament from simply abolishing the judicial independence tomorrow?” he said in the newspaper, which believes the draft law is unconstitutional.
“The law is dramatic and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most regarded independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media court “will always be anticipated because it is a prolonged arm of the government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to the parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law, “takes the media effectively into a war attack.”The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya would have suffered “a heavy blow” and called the draft “drakonic.”
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the Islamist attacks on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenian media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published images of security cameras on which the units sent to the place of the assassination allegedly stole the luxury shopping center.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded to the order of hearing two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the invitation was withdrawn after a media shock.
According to the new law, media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenian shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “one punishment can push most radio broadcasters into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of the “live blogosphere” of Kenya.
If they keep the media silent, politicians could do whatever they want without punishment.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenya media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If politicians give up themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to the time of hunting and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan lawmakers have already taken the public trouble on themselves in the past.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and resumed their tax-free salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings per month – one of the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
On the importance for the city and the football club, the official inauguration ceremony for the art racing sport square, despite the cold weather and the rain, did not affect anything.
Everyone wanted a pleasant holiday last Saturday, but Peter didn’t want to play.
Thus had all those who came without a rainbow or could not hold such one for any reason.
This happened to the musicians who surrounded the fest act, just like some speakers.
Nass was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the realization of a dream.
His gratitude was in the first place to the mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, the companies involved and the association members who engaged.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty retirees moved 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by Landtag deputy Karl Rombach.
Other greetings were given to the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southern Bad Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Bureau, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp reminded that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn placed the original grass so that it could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when it was thought to build a third place at the field of the football club or at the real school on the Salinese Sea.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas about the creation of an art racing sport site emerged, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were initiated two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, promised a cost participation of €100,000 for the construction of the square, and the land granted a grant of €104,000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to acquire the remaining 356 000 euros to the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp agreed.
The construction of the 68 times 108 meters-sized Art Rain Square began on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3,000 cubic meters of land were deployed, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt-Bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal and judicial issues.
The competent working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, parliamentary membership and the federal police.
The Migration and Integration Working Group also intended to continue its consultations.
This is one of the topics of double citizenship, where both sides have opposite views.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD submitted its No to a truck mouth requested by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat rate for multiplication and thus ecologically counterproductive,” said SPD’s negotiator for transportation, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
They threatened evacuation on land roads that are already the target of accidents.
The introduction of a mouth for all cars would also be a first step from Pronolds’ point of view.
“There is the risk that at a later time the compensation for Germany will be deleted,” he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the outdoor stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be right summer again?" was actually not the question on Friday evening on the Killesberg outdoor stage.
It was a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions so for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the image gallery to show the "Singing Föhnwelle".
Driver seriously injured in an accident
In a crash on Thursday night, a 37-year-old truck driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Mush was traveling in the direction of Grefrath at 21.15 p.m. with her car on the camper outer ring.
When she wanted to move to the left to the St. Töniser Street, she ignored the car of the 37-year-old.
The vehicles collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident on the shell
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza on Thursday night, around 20 p.m., on the left track of the two-pure Reichenaustraße toward the city.
Shortly before the circle traffic at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left side track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right track.
This was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constantine.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old man behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of about 15,000 injuries occurred, the police.
The trail had to be closed during the accident, it continued.
Vienna airport starts passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be such passages at Vienna-Schwechat airport in the future.
Most of the speaker transmissions fall away - the noise level is to be so significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Vienna, the airport of Vienna follows an international trend by setting passages affecting individuals.
So, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already giving up the noise calls.
Due to the disappearance of these passages – an average of about 200 personal calls by the speakers per day – it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
“It has also shown in the experience that these individual passages were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changing flights or departure hours here is a bit missing,” Kleemann said in an interview with the radio.
Highlander Games at the Cold Court
In addition to the brake wagon with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7, at 13.30 the Highlander Games begin.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are swabishly heated on the Cold Court.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of throwing trees, throwing hips, and water throwing.
Four and a half meters is the tree stone long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It doesn’t come to the extent,” says organizer Peter Saile.
The tribe must be thrown down, to be overwhelmed once and then just get to bed.
This is assessed by most points.
When throwing, it depends on target accuracy.
From eight meters away is thrown on a pflock.
Skills and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying water over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two of each "clan" or team may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual betting are awarded prizes.
Training can be done at 10 p.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can play in the Scottish rocket.
Swabish clothes are also permitted.
For "Outfit" the jury gives a few bonus points.
You can sign up until an hour before the competition starts.
With the Scottish-Sweden Highlander Games and the Traktor Pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is required on the festival on Saturday.
In the evening, the blues musicians come at their expense.
At 19 p.m. the birabömische Blasmusik from Schömberg forms the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleets of Polkas and Märsche.
But their repertoire also includes sensational walks and a satter big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black baron, will be here for a long time.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the Narrenzunft.
On Sunday, the music association entertains Leinstetten for the breakfast, from 14 a.m. the farmer chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival climb out.
The opening is on Friday with DJ Ralf.
Other program points are on Saturday and Sunday, including the Oldtimer and Schleppert meetings, exhibitions of companies on the theme of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize labyrinth, the craftsmanship market and the sheep.
Especially for children, there is a striping garden, strohhüpfburg, tractor ride (under instructions) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the supporting association Multi-Weck Hall, the Skiclub and the tractor-friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and Egg Alternatives
Vegan diet requires herbal alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant seed is, for example, a quartz set.
The Vegetarian Federation calls the World Vegetarian Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of the World Vegan Day on 1 November, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt is replaced by soya yogurt.
Instead of milk, soya, peanut butter, or peanut butter may be used.
Replaced plant seeds replace traditional seeds.
There are also vegetable alternatives for eggs.
For example, a half destroyed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binding in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mus or a teaspoon of melted linen seeds plus three teaspoons of water are suitable for it.
Locker becomes teas instead of eggs for example with a mixture of a teaspoon of bakery powder, a teaspoon of food strength and three teaspoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soya yogurt or seedentofu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are eating vegan, i.e. pure vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School met the American major city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately departed to the Brooklyn Bridge, which was reached by foot to the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here, a fascinating view of the world-famous Skyline has already been offered, which in the evening light makes a special excitement.
Through the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithfully to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided on the Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Freedom could be reached with a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went through the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, students were able to get an overview of the fascinating big city from the 373 meters high viewing platform of the Empire State Building while enjoying the view.
After that, it went through the harsh driving of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have arrived in their host families and experience the school day at the Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the Day of the Name of St. Hubertus, a Hubertusmosis is celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the sage, according to a fairly negligent hunter, who was turned through a vision and later appointed the bishop of Lüttich.
The Jagdhorn Blaser Group of the Jagddreiter Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth music on Parforce Horners (Nature Horners in the mood It) after ancient, originally French melodies.
The flashes wear riding clothes because they mainly musically accompany ridders, horses and dog monks on slopes.
The ceremony will take place on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30 p.m.
The new shade brilliates with a new cafe.
One that invites to stay and return.
One who wants to make the name of the program.
Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of a visit to the same-name cafe at the Opschlag in the district of Kleve in view to the High School of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the cafe with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but handful and repeatedly experienced.
It’s fun and it’s just nice.
A look into the inner life on the 8th edition gives the spectator a good feeling on the edition.
The modern, but not cool cafe environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team, with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the forefront, turns the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually covered fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name as gastronomists before the opening of the jewelry cafés on the outskirts: in Kranenburg they conducted the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic cafe lovers expect more audience.
Not least through the college.
“We don’t have a specific target,” says Daniel Büttner.
Instead, the two here want to address young students as much as seniors and all ages between them.
About coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner pair stands behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the smellful hot fruit in the various variations itself.
Expressed
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
“There’s a baguette – that’s my thing,” she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright cafe.
Better to say one.
Because the port party took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringworking night.
“Beautiful, successful and funny,” the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone’s thing.
Per this is why Daniel Büttner is not an outstanding fan of event nights: "You can't do it right to everyone."
And with an event I always talk to those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore, events will rather be the exception for us.
“We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible.”
It should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products that are offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the outskirts in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic emile.
To the pleasure of many keys, the guests from close and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

Thanksgiving Day at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to come.
In the association room of the hostel "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone the harmonious together all in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festivity to celebrate honors.
The special award "Song of the Year" was awarded this time by writer Rolf Wagener.
“You’ve not only written a lot for us, but you’ve also drawn a few rounds for us, our heartfelt thanks for that,” Chores Chairman Erich Schlotmann said.
The awards for the participation in the performances and chorus exhibitions through activity stripes went this year to the chorus leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Song of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
Fifth place was noted by Artur Brückner.
A special gratitude was sent by the Board to the team of associate manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had decorated an extra class menu and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets to its regular chorus trials every Tuesday at 19.45 in the association room.
“New songs are welcome to us at any time,” Schlotmann said.
United Nations announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty.
Before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be approved by world political leaders, including Mrs. Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that it was time to “think over national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to engage in a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not be afraid to implement this mandate granted to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the Millennium Goals.”
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four days, the handball overligist still has a good mood.
At this point, coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt.
Everyone is fully motivated in this matter.
I hope that we will finally win again.
“Because I don’t know any more about the taste of such a victory,” Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Though the Third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cut out trees, Malmon has warned the finger in advance.
I have trained many players in the A-Youth.
That’s why you’ll be very motivated against your former coach.
"It is also necessary to wait if there is further reinforcement from the first," SG coach explains.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must increase compared to the previous performances.
First of all, in the covering work and in the switching game, it was great at last.
The exploitation of opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope that my players finally get the head free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing due to collisions between influential persons
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to vote on a rare public demonstration calls for peace.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
From fear of the country’s future, she exchanged her business clothes with a t-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday on the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there are daily reports of collisions between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebellion movement that was initially supported by Rhodesia governed by the White and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict, but the recent events have worried foreign investors and local people.
For the rapidly growing economy, a lot is at stake, as the discovery of huge gas deposits in the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring over $50 billion in investments from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S. in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional high town of Renamos, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, said Renamos spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of the collisions and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to unleash concerns about an instability.
At AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a “loster” who “will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force his decisions to the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words that Renamo resigned the 1992 Peace Agreement.
Against the FT, he said he meant that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement.
“Our vision is to start negotiations again and seriously,” Mazanga said.
Earlier talks between the parties have little contributed to solving the tensions that have been triggered by a series of collisions this year.
“We have here two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who gathering their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at the Open University and a Mosambik expert.
No one of them is good in negotiating and no one is ready to make the necessary consent.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt of a violent movement to obtain permissions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo’s election success has decreased since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the election.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is expected when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but it has committed unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connections.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining firms such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded with discretion to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted “to warn the international community that things are not well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, as many people have already worried about corruption, progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protestant, said the people just wanted stability.
“No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to restore peace and usable roads,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “sample for life,” a writer says.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against smart tricks,” and the Artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” so Crossley-Holland pledged for a “careful selection” of age-friendly works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that among authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic” children would be “completely off” because in entertaining stories the messages would be “underwhelmingly” transmitted.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Angelsaksic and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.”
Per the greatest difference between an adult writer who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is in the need to communicate hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or to lead to a happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subjectively represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob is back in Freihof.
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took his residence in Haslach, on Sunday his last years lived in the "free court".
A lot of spectators were enthusiastic about the very short-term play.
From the arrival through the award of the honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actress Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a fun piece, which received a lot of pleasure under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with through the ten different scenes, explained connections and broken times from youth to upcoming retirement.
On 22 October 1913, Hansyakob returns home to his children's sky, in his refuge.
And then the play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again glowed in his parade role as the great son of the city.
Stilept he carried with the two-spanner and "Black Forest Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum man knew it was incredibly good to put himself into the role of the sister and gave her in mimics and gestures an incredible life.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played properly selected music pieces and thus rounded the performance.
To award the honorary citizenship the honor was then given to Haslach’s mayor Heinz Winkler, who, in representation of the then official Hättich together with a part of the council, made his attendance.
The three-King singers then made their waiting, which caused Hansyakob to call: "Oh, how beautifully, then the youth memories of my own three-King time will live again."
With their song "O Jesulein", they rejoiced the audience in the courts as well as the Storchentagskins with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the Church had expressed at the same time as his concerns about the expansions in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the consequences of war.
In the home, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his place of rest.
"A quiet spirit finally found his rest and was going home forever," it said at the end of the game.
A lot of praise and a lot of praising words were given by the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants Grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sporty departure of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
For if there is a Wildcard procedure, then there is now a competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refuses to apply for a possible rear place.
“We’re not going to participate in the Wildcard process,” said former national player Pascal Roller, who has set up the concept for a professional club in Hansstadt since 2012.
However, a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the Wildcard procedure until it is found that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," said Neckar's boss Alexander Reil to our newspaper.
Until May 23 Upsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic validity in the Bundesliga.
So far, the license has been rejected twice.
The arbitration court is the final instance.
Haigerloch: Dinner church turns to the point of view
As the City’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the City’s Cultural and Tourism Office dedicates the last of its this year’s public theme lectures on Sunday, October 27, to the Dinner Church.
After the visit to the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerlocher is to be considered after 1850, when the Haigerlocher came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the dinner church.
There the leaders get the story of the building of the church told and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area and through it.
Not least, in the church also falls the look at the dinner painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original-true reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guide is at 15 p.m. at the Atomkeller-Museum.
The maps are in the box of the Nuclear Cell Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourism Office of the City of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also speak in Russia.
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was by the Interfax agency, referring to unnamed circles who are familiar with the situation.
Such a question can be resolved interstate.
Snowden’s exit from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source.
Because Germany is a US ally, Snowden threatens extradition.
Long breathing is paid
Six men's teams fought for the title in the tennis tournament.
At the end, the holding of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was the top of the tournament.

The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were point-equal with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
During the winning ceremony, Carmen Müller was able to finally transfer the wandercup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the target line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze trips reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful opening of the tournament took place.

Schrilles Piepsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in the country.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the hold.
The company has several iron in the fire on the site.
In addition to the coal imports, Rhenus Midgard invests in wind logistics among other things.
Black blows the stone coal on the warehouse in front of the deck.
Two enormous blue slurry and back charging devices distribute or charge the coal here according to the need.
At every movement of the shutdown devices, a brilliant warning sound tells over the fields.
“The signals serve security and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the event of unfavorable wind, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and therefore has contacted the affected, the 40-year-old says.
In close agreement with the authorities, we are now trying to keep the warning signals silent with technical measures.
He also focuses on the open dialogue with the neighbors.
Matthias Schrell has a lot to do.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to invest in coal imports for power plants and is one of the biggest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters deep leather wave in front of the terminal, Capesize bulkcarrier can also be made here for a long time.
“This year we’re going to break the 3 million-ton mark at the turnover,” Schrell said.
In addition to the local Eon power plant, the import coal goes to internal power plants.
If then the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the network, about 5 million tons of coal imports per year will be realistic.
The three ships on the bridge and the second transport band could make up to 10 million.
Baseball players are optimistic despite their first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague couldn’t shed down the enormous optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
“No one can stop us from believing in winning even against the best team of Europe in the past two years,” Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defense Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: There is also basketball in Munich!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but they were simply not clear enough in the critical stages.
The guests initially managed to turn a 15-point back 13 minutes before the end into a direction before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
“We have struggled incredibly back against the twice Euroleague champion, but then we have made a lot of mistakes again,” Bayern’s professor Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful winners of the Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two matches against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: A little hundred years ago, the varied artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd straight jokes in the form of a conversation.
Thro the years, Fays’ innovation has been developed, as last at the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well known to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy charity event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slip-free fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation at both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she's most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, on racial themes focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visiting magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has evolved into a renowned television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television show entitled “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me when he is here, then sometimes he goes through the street between two buildings and thinks: Hey, if I lose all my money, then I may live here.
Iran is satisfied with nuclear negotiations
Iran is a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five United Nations veto powers and Germany is satisfied with the process of negotiations.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to address the differences of the past years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would still be a long way, but the nuclear head trader is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Players with Machete
Two children accused the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14- and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunt.
Armed with machets and messers, they shoot the 11-year-old on Tuesday and throw the body into a fountain, the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they had played football in a working district in front of their homes.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who had brought them to say she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the attack before the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted the intentional murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly, among other things, called a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
The taxpayer must go to prison
For exploitation of human trafficking, charges, threats, harassment and dangerous body injuries, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Federal Guard soldier, who worked as a gate guard in Afghanistan after two operations, made a confession as part of a process negotiation.
Accordingly, in five cases he met women through internet or telephone contacts, which he sent on the streak after a few weeks against their will.
He handled resistance to break with violence and threats.
The revenue of the women, which partly bought for him for years, he retained.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he interrupts women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who mediated the women, he brought them to various bordels in the southwest.
There he left them partly monitoring to control their revenue.
In court, the accused first claimed he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion next to him.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about psychological restrictions and thus a limited liability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not hear any of the damaged women.
As a Kripo official, after a first announcement by telephone surveillance measures, at least four more cases of exploitable human trafficking were identified.
The talks were marked by high aggression.
In subsequent hearings, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had found blue spots throughout the body, has not made any statements until today.
It is a "completely broken personality" who sees violence and exploitation in this metier as normal.
The accused regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has dissolved himself from these circles and wants to live a very normal life after his arrest," he said.
Oil prices continue after up to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overestimated a report that the energy hungry manufacturing sector in China is growing.
The reference oil for delivery in December fell by 14 cents at the New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe late morning to $96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened the prices in the past few weeks.
The U.S. Energy Ministry said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there were signs of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China’s economy, whose growth has risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level in the previous quarter in two decades.
Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
The court blocked NYPD’s stop-and-frisk directive
A federal call court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had requested changes to the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program, and removed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the judgment of judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a City appeal was decided.
The judge had judged in August that the city violates the Constitution with the way the program for the detention and interrogation of persons is implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedy measures, including the decision to establish a supervisory body to assist the police in the amendment of its directive and the corresponding training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by determining a judge to avoid the appearance of partiality; this was partially justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted in an inappropriate way black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service surveillance, and organized a pilot program with the cameras on the body in the districts where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
A oral trial on the call of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
This type of controls have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the term of the partial mayor Michael Bloomberg increased to a permanent high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a complaint, which became a collective complaint.
Fans of changes in the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and efficient police as well as influence the way other police presidents implement the regulation.
Opponents are the view that the changes would undermine the morality of the police, but not the crime; also would be lost money and the wider problem of a police not solved, which is under pressure after the dismissal of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it would not end the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional, but only reform the way the controls were implemented by the NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only be reached by dreaming camels.
With this beduine wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Holding Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the 10th birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first chairman Henne detailed the work of the association.
He was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
After that, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on the site.
During the talks, images of the bets were displayed on a large wall so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned events.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic facility and now plans, according to Henne, to operate in the association in advisory function.
In 2008, the Bedroom Schleeh from Baiersbronn in a record time of just a week created the hospital station in Socogim, a district of misery on the edge of the capital - voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which Nagold is intended to rationalize the birth clinic.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, relaxation against burn-out.
Due to the political disturbances in the country, it was not possible to take as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to hospitalize here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, so in March this year medical equipment, medications, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania of the Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile cattle stall and painting the experiences of the Stammheimer musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motives he named his work in the field of accounting as a young deputy.
When he realized how much money was lost on the road, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Furthermore, Fuchtel emphasized that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It is not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set up phone hacking to check a tip
Previous News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly set “telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in Old Bailey, News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper ordered the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby’s Voicemails and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“According to the Prosecutor’s opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch them on a fresh act, but one who likes to face people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said, NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories investigatively: telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the monitoring, otherwise it cannot be.
How is it with the first?
Do you know about the phone hacking?
He disputes this, but we say, “And if he knew it.”
Rumors about a Clarkes affair were first received by NotW’s feature edition when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told: “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A band with voice emails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found records on the detective’s computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “projects”.
During the time the research went, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson sent her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to release tomorrow and I want to talk about with Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The defendants heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he was lying himself with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks struggle to have committed to hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have granted the phone hacking.
As a result of protest against the planned Reich tax, the French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A meeting ends out unresolved.
In the conflict about the Reichsteuers, the government and professional football in France maneuvered themselves into a baggage after a failed settlement meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris and heard their complaints.
However, he refused to save football from the planned 75 percent tax on revenue of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side was too hard.
The strike announced by the end of November will also be passed, the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, said.
The dates set between November 29 and December 2 in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus expired.
No absolute protection is possible
“We want to engage the inhabitants in planning early,” Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens’ information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the municipal hall to explain the planned actions, ask questions, express concerns and introduce ideas.
Heussler clearly stated: “The final decisions are taken by the members of the municipal council.”
The flood, which occurred unprepared on May 15, 2009, has been a narrow event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, he said.
A river area inspection was ordered with the neighboring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“Protecting as many buildings as possible is the goal,” he said.
According to the German Weather Service, the planning of the protection against a flood is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change will be taken into account by a 15 percent add-on.
In specialized areas, this is referred to as "HQ 100aClima".
The masses of water that caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen are equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
“There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved,” he said.
To the protection of HQ 100aClimate, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect land grants of about 70 percent.
Heussler, however, pointed out that the promotion is only possible if a whole concept is implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could begin with implementation.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented in the municipal council already last week (we) presents local measures in the removal of the Irm fleet from the Stammheimer Valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, participants took advantage of the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dames and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, the specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that the combination of all the proposed measures is necessary to the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is kept to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Unfortunately, there was an unrest in the old town, which, even in normal storms, had to suffer overload of the channel network again and again.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Heusler, however, pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three-year rainy events could be violated.
To dimensional the wastewater channels, millions would be drowned.
Heavily injured after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
Police immediately closed the road completely, but could say little about the accident at first.
However, there are several statements that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles broke together, and the woman was so hard stuck that the firefighters took about half an hour to release her from the vehicle crash.
The cause of the accident was unclear at first.
The two people were injured in nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
He could be called the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Gottsucher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relativity in the outside: the staying eyes, the bark, the high face.
And as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky with his massive work is to be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, which is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories releases two thousand.
Dick explains America - the kingdom of amazing technical progress, accompanied by paranoia, security foolishness and the belief to be selected.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John's Revelation and a computer manual.
Per he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized early that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the Creator from his creator.
This is the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is significant now.
The "Minorities Report" comes from 1956, it spreads the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
Here the principle of “pre-crime” is developed, “pre-crime”, that is, what is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In the Dicks world, which looks terribly like our, mutants look into the future - and the police attacks.
“We capture individuals who have not violated any law,” the head of the authority says.
“We take them away before they can commit a crime.”
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a penalty camp full of pesud criminals."
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being implemented into the fact.
Dick’s story works like the blue light for the anti-terror laws and the NSA’s hearing.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick’s story is not over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no more power distribution, the military controls everyday life - and what remains from the state.
Then the supervisor himself is supervised and carried out a future crime.
The system turns through.
It is perfect, but it lies.
It creates its own conditions.
Mistakes and victims not only buy, but build on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Discusses about Merkel in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. secret affair about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency.
Earlier, the Greens-Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met in Moscow as the first German politician to talk to him about the affair.
NSA reveals increases corporate paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the capital of Germany.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Anti-Terrorism (BVT), the German Intelligence Service, he should photograph the roof of the U.S. Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a speech exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use the possibilities of foreign spying to “stole the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could increase their international competitiveness or their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower employee, began publishing his full horn on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director to the speech.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and acquired data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The façade to overlapping led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was linked, for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the vision, then corporate leaders are also potential goals.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, Chairman of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the U.S. now posed a as high risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting company EY.
However, Snowden’s documents do not show that the U.S. has disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the United States.
Companies are skeptical about this.
The Bundestag proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is how it doesn’t work,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, we’t have left it out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the scope and technical refinancing of the US spy agencies revealed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies who had previously seen the greatest risk of spy in China.
Cloud computing is making a big change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the U.S. is subject to the jurisprudence and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, after the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S. members planned to use a U.S. provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy CEO of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German corporate leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at any cost.
The fact that economic espionage takes place is no surprise.
It has always been so.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The corporate leadership is usually not cheerful about the countermeasures they have taken, as this gives the attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been informed that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick on a fair or unwaveredly leave a laptop in the hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi automotive manufacturers, says it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid devices when they travel abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid devices are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are worldwide market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. has warned its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimates in February, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China among the countries that used to obtain economic data of the hacking.
A board member of a German Blue-Chip company agreed that when it comes to economic spying, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French intelligence service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The intelligence services know very accurately that all countries, even when they work together in the fight against terror, spy their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special exhibition in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: the Retro-Look has kept up again.
This begins with wedding clothes.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In front, the clothes that are repeatedly rooted and wrapped with stickers are closed, often with a slurry, and behind, they go down on the back and often end in a slurry.
However, the spirits are separated, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Dressmüller.
For men, the dress is dominated with west and plastron, but it can also be chosen with cream or brown combinations.
It is important to choose the location, it was explained.
Jewelry-free bedrooms are not optimal, the atmosphere should be special.
Here the domain made attention to its own offer in the remission.
Whoever wants to go ahead with the car, you have an offer for it.
“But the skies are also popular for young women’s divorces,” he says.
Romantic is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "post-wedding photo" - that is, reception series at special places, preferably like waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of the successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding sheets, cakes and even a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylish.
Do not forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Dog Friends Successful
For a repeated time, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he achieved 94 points in the beginner class and secure the fifth place, and with the 15 months old Marley he brought it to the twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp put himself with her Woody in class 1 the critical eyes of the performance judge.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a gathered ringmatte in his high school hall, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in a stained matte behind the tribune in the school hall.
Investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which, however, doubts the 17-year-old's family.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, to FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed he was dead as the sheriff concluded.
“They believe that it deprives any logic, violates the laws of physics as well as the healthy human mind,” Crump said.
Instead, they are convinced that the truth will be hidden to protect the person or individuals who are responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag,” he commented.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a “position-related retardation.”
But a second autopsy resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation of Johnson's death, he will commission the FBI to carry out the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should publish all the surveillance videos that the investigators have reviewed.
The teenage’s parents said they hoped that the videos contained evidence of how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-obliged children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States is currently suffering from food allergies.
The prevalence of food allergies among children, according to CDC, increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines include information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in teachers and staff and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have the presence of Epinephrine – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to be able to face a potentially fatal over-sensitivity reaction.
Legislatives in the states have recently changed the regulations so that schools can keep Epinephrin easier available.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms named by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something presses on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair lies on it,” or “My tongue cries.”
Parents of intersexual children can choose “gender undefined”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unidentified genitals.
Newborns are no longer attributed strongly male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “undefined” or “undefined” on the birth certificate.
The objective of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make agreed decisions regarding genital assignment operations in newborns, and to fight discrimination from intersex people.
An intersex person said to the BBC years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I keep the flickwork that was created by doctors shattered and full of wrath.
Approximately one in 2,000 children are born neither as a boy nor as a girl every year.
They belong to the intersexual, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “Sexual Differentiation Disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, membranes (ears or ovaries) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson was probably intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise to use the best available information on gender allocation if a determination is not possible, and not to wait for the child’s psychological and physical development before – if anyway – to decide for an operation.
The New Yorker psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized in gender identification, said the new German law “klings for a good thing.”
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children this is not true,” he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersex people are to be distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These properties showed themselves in underlying sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender persons are exposed in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not matching the gender picture now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world’s first “genderless” person after a court had approved the lifelong preservation of a “not-defined” gender status.
German expatriates will have a third assignment next to M and W, X for intersexual, the Ministry of the Interior said.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the “gender theory” should be removed from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also spoke against the German law, with the argument: “If the world is trapped into a new state where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are tracing two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth.
“Parenthood is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know the gender of your child,” she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female gender parts were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both gender.
Even ten years ago, medicine considered gender as something that can be destroyed and then rebuilt.
However, the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they don’t know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
“From the mid-20th century it was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, then they called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The dominant theory on the treatment of children with unidentified genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who expressed the view that gender is formable.
He characterized the term “gender identity” and argued, social and environmental attacks – how parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and characterized whether a person sees himself as male or female.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” in 1966 his theories became controversial.
He advises the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated during a spotted cut, to cast the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At 38 he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the entrance of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but two-idea genitals.
The doctors were unclear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organs and testicles were removed by surgery shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical documents.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one has ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genital organs.
After he had learned the truth, he switched back to the male identity, received testosterone injections and left his breasts removed.
Through the operation he became infertile.
Today, he is struggling for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the chief executive of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law could “incite to stick and stigmatize”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and give the child a ‘non-defined’ one,” she said.
We fear that this favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will impact, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said their organization supports the Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law concerns the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When you are an adult, you can decide about your body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Breast Radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “completes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is infertile, she hopes, however, to be able to get a child through adoption or a lease mother.
“The law gives parents room so they don’t have to make overwhelming decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things, and so gives them the time before they write “manly” or “womanly”.
In this way, everything is okay – you attract the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness.
And you don’t have to do an operation that can no longer be reversed.
“This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents turn away because they think they’d not do the right thing,” she explained.
In the end, the child decides about the gender that best fits him – and that’s wonderful.
This allows children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown girl injured by shooting from car
Unknown people have wounded a 12-year-old woman in a car shooting in Sachsen-Anhalt.
The assassins were likely to have shot a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air-pressed weapon.
This was by the police in the castle.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wave.
The rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car passing through a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The victims also shot at a bus stop.
A dish was broken.
Then they drove from it.
Police investigate, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back to Kempten on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only twice called to ejaculating children who threw them against household facades.
Since the household owners recognized this in time and removed the eggs equally, there may not have been any damage.
Moreover, some Sylvesterböller have probably been burned in the city area, but there has not been any damage.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Road that his car was stumbled with clopapier and his wheel blends were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his roadside blinds all in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives dreaming.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old trees, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is just a few minutes by public transportation.
“Hope you’re not afraid of spines?” asked Waltraud Ries, showing a fat spine on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me.
You know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spinach phobia, but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer be managed, she explains.
Moreover, since a meniscus operation, the midfifth has to learn on her own body what it means to move from floor to floor with disability.
Recently, a book from her has been published on the topic 'Happy living in age - which form of living is best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't happen at age," she begins to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in the mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who deal with the topic of ' Living in Age'.
The majority of people will take it as long as it is possible.
Always only the others are old,” she says shyly.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really high, you think.
“It may be too late,” he said.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 housing models for self-determined living in the age.
“Which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
The solution is not for age.
Even those who can afford the pension seat in Tuscany or Bretagne should always think that he may also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the country's language, you can unite in Dolce Vita,' the special bookwriter gives expulsion volunteers to consider.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative housing forms or the frequently cited Pensioner-WG.
Everyone has his own ticks and ticks.
"For me, such a residential community would not be anything," she says with an eyewinker.
Not as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
“In age, you just need your retirement rooms,” says Ries.
However, that an elderly household community can still work, the author does not want to exclude.
But that should be different than in the classical student-WG.
And sometimes you just want your rest,” she believes.
At least they are not alone in the capital.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of citizens' service living in the age of the country's capital city.
Their service counseles people around the topic of 'aging'.
That’s why just the elderly people would often also take discomforts and restrictions in purchase, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that’s also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that everyone who is engaged in the age-friendly rebuilding of their home or apartment should first be thoroughly informed and not hire the best craftsmen.
Today there are also specialists for the age-friendly reconstruction.
Even in the rental apartment let one or the other realize, and if it is just the toilet room elevation, the interior architecture clarifies.
But not always the existing apartment can be transformed according to age and thus barrierlessly, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience was made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stairs lift inside the apartment, which would also be a steep-plasted way to the apartment door, but it would be a much larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, it cries her more than before the spinne on her apartment door.
U.S. wants to further prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is continued to be accused of disclosing unauthorized secret information.
Therefore, he must enter a criminal proceedings in the United States, U.S. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change it.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, had appealed to the United States not to threaten him with further punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbel’s statements were the statements of a parliamentary and not the statements of a German government member.
Secret service detective Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First of all, he wants to clarify his situation.
This was revealed by the former US-seeked NSA employee in a not addressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter has the following text following a translation by Ströbele:
to the competent
I was asked to write to you about your investigation to the mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously a contractual or direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
During my employment in these institutions, I became witness to systematic law violations of my government, which caused me to act from moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of comprehensive surveillance that is not liable to anyone, as a service to the public.
These spying revelations brought many proposals to new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefit for society from these findings is becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken into purchase have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts was proved positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breakdown of loyalty and strives to criminalize and accuse political opinions.
However, saying the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the U.S. government, with the support of the international community, will reject this discretion.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate in the responsible disclosure of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterling’s mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council in its recent non-public session.
The building changed its owners at a “adjust” price.
“The community is satisfied,” Mayer emphasizes.
100,000 euros were put in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has transferred the responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to rise for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and cleaning the walkway.
“This effort is gone,” Mayer rejoiced.
Concert at high summer temperatures
The Hammereisenbach Music Association holds a place concert on the terrace of the Hammer Hosthouse.
When director Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of Hammricher musicians.
Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
Honeck thanked in this framework everyone who helped successfully cope with the first musician-hock.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisors have secretly thought to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, the New York Times said.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the newly published book, and it on Thursday night that the president’s top consultants had conducted “enormous group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s declining hope for re-election looks better if he leaves Biden fall.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly follows the history of the efforts of the campaign’s leading staff and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect it has on the survey values of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton with the Vice President.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest counselors – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House chief counselors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the expected change.
In “Double Down” it is claimed that Daley has stood at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “long, personal relationship” before it was finally decided against such a chess after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “will not significantly improve Obama’s chances”.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole number of things that should be considered, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible survey values at that time, so we thought, “For God’s will, what do we do?”
While Daley described the investigations as “common care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the re-election campaign there was considerable effort to find out whether such a train would be paid in terms of the elections.
“Campagns don’t spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don’t seriously think about something,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
While Daley said he didn’t believe that the president was “conscious of the possible change,” the former staff chief admitted that it was “possible” that Obama was aware of it.
Martin added that “Double Down” does not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political sondages had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama didn’t know anything about the investigations about whether Biden should fall in the election.
“It is possible,” Martin replied.
What happens in my e-mail?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the usual mail the letter secret technically implemented?
In the conception of the early Internet services, the priority was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not pay attention to creating a stable foundation for a reliable letter exchange.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail is more like an open postal card than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", the computers of the two are then directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to its provider.
Will traditional e-mails be read through the network?
Most emails are read several times on the road by software robots.
The provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
On the recipient systems, a virus check is also carried out.
Additionally, the providers will check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is either deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as Gmail, the robot also identifies the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can hide the corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the emails?
The chance that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read emails.
Criminal prosecution authorities and intelligence services also have legal possibilities of receiving or receiving emails.
This is possible for illegal expulsions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
In the mainly private mailboxes, Yahoo and Google, according to a survey by Convios Consulting in August 2013, only play a subordinate role.
While the shares of Yahoo Mail were last dropped, Google’s Gmail could significantly decline.
Mother in the woods and retirement
When his murdered mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and care money.
To be able to further cash pensions and care money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First he hidden the death of the 89-year-old, then he stumbled the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to be charged for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: At that time it came out that the caring mother no longer needed medications.
The investigator told the retire that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because it was strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an obduktion did not provide any evidence of a capital crime.
Desire for ice cream that lights in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the dark lighting ice – using cells.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the sea beasts and created a bright flavor.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on holes and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the lighting protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thus increasing the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the food react to the heat in the mouth and glowed – so the more you leak, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for £200.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH will rise and the ice will shine.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed to us ideal to bring it to the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the coal lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about £140.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his new creation is to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is in and for itself impossible due to the light breach caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a curve that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists.
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Federation League after six games.
Exactly now, the team of Ingo Ehlers will come tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
“I hope we finally get the head free,” Ehlers’ behavior is optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has a complete framework available.
We also play time as we do.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to rise in the cover, which last left everything other than a secure impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after his first season victory against Northhorn.
The game was a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favourite for a long time, because in the derby everything can happen.
However, Panitz is now going to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double-playing right at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: in numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today I am becoming a Halloween mouse.
In the last two years I have not declared myself willing to distribute from my apartment from sweets, and I will probably not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep in terms of Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations, the U.S. Retail Association (NRF) said.
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will amount to about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting unlive objects are the last scream.
Women don’t have to go in sexy clothes anymore, they can now also make seductive foods like pizza, hamburger, or potatoes.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet that the Daft-Punk world room men will make it in the Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most sought-seated costumes are zombies, Batman, Pirates and Wizards.
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year for costumes for their pets, the NRF said.
This is a lot of hot dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we’re not humble.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate jelly, slurry, candy and rubber.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, 41 million people pulling through the quarters with the saying “sweet or saures”.
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s do nothing – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
This is about nine billion corn cells.
It’s a mystery that I couldn’t solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it smells.
They have great names such as “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, stands in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognised Spukhahuses in the United States, which earn $500 million, according to America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just pick up your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you don’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you stand on leaves a comment like “net face expression.”
But let’s finally get to the curves.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Curve when we were children, and cutting a curve latter is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we have made up from small.
Fortunately, the “Baby in the Cube” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up with cutting the cube and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on curbs, according to the US Census Bureau.
The curb-laters, which slowly rooted in the front garden, are likely to come from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms of curb have been harvested.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and cut something beautiful out of their 921 kilograms heavy curve.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescue forces mounted bodies
The firefighters had to take off in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the countryside Hof starts fire on Friday night.
The rescue forces pulled a cooled body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a coated body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
It is still unclear whether it is a resident, as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
It burned in the floor of the house late Thursday night.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames hit out of a window.
Police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The whole floor was damaged.
All the other inhabitants were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was unclear at first.
Germany’s largest countryside church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran Land Church of Hannover expects that the number of pastors currently around 1,800 will decrease by half by 2030, according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day process itself.
With the bourgeoisie, the countryside for the first time has commissioned a full-time pastor to encourage young people for the study of theology.
Currently, less and less young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burphy leads this to the process of dissolving: “God’s voice is silent, the world is loud.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my timetable and I can place my points where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to humans as souls.
They deserve as much as teachers and can live well.
Certainly more is paid in the free economy, but for that theologists would have a safe employer.
This comes to the young people of today, who are not just about a career, but about a meaningful job.
According to the countryside church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retired every year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat.
In thin populated countryside such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The Theology Study offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point courts as well as a freelance facility.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare new people for the traps and reality of Rally Raid.
We really developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters call for the rescue of a dog who was caught 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky front in a stone break.
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a small traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a pedestrian in a stone break in her misleading location.
Firefighters sailed on the rocky wall and saved the dog from the safe death.
The firefighters succeeded in bringing a puppy in safety, which was stuck in a rocky wall at a 15 meters high advance.
The nine-month-old cockerspaniel dog, Ruby, walked away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a stone crash on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, whom the dog belonged, came to the stone flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back in reception and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted help calls on social networks when she had escaped into the stone break after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a pedestrian who carried out his dog saw Ruby stumbling on the 15 meters high point in a stone break.
The Technical Rescue Team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and went on to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “He was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move any muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she is well.
She then eaten a few dog cakes.
It was a quite unusual task.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team specialist, said: “Ruby had a huge luck.”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing except tiredness and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To look at the rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really there.
It was wonderful to keep you in your arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the fatigue became too big and it would collapse, it would probably collapse.
The firefighters did great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid it would fall down, but it stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio channel this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker in the evening, and that “he gave me up when I was 18.”
She added, “It’s been a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “catalogically denies that he has ever made approach attempts with Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year.
Their new album “Prism” landed on top 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European dissolution gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we will be warned that an independent Scotland is necessary to join the Schengen Area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls in Berwick and a stainless border along the Hadrianswall.
In fact, the Strathclyde sample pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not matter in the headlines.
Also, no one has mentioned that the EU Member States often adhere to their strict rules when it is more favorable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen Area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would be just a small consent in exchange for what you really want from the Scots.
In fact not a story.
And one that has already come in the years that it’s already like a fossil: the first time I’ve heard the “independence means pass control” end at least 40 years ago.
One interesting point is lost in the continuous repetition of this ancient story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why do the London Joch exchange against the Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the big, after-war plan for the unity of Europe has broken down.
With the Eurocrisis, the project Europe has officially died.
Parties all over the EU are winning on the ground who are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro over the EU currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to obtain about five million votes at the Bundestag elections in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance against the plan to create a federalistic Europe.
The current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is forced by the retention of the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to let.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, South Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity deficit against Germany.
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending, according to Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the Brussels “green” energy guidelines – a code for the subsidization of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourth for gas compared to the United States.
This is a low cost share, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
All the world’s wage statements do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap U.S. steam gas.
As a result, a revolt arises, especially in France, the former Cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which you could keep Germany in shock and raise Paris at the height with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has opened its own economic policy, with which the afflicted French economy has to fight.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU hostile Front National has just won a decisive post-election and thus referred the ruling socialists to the third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it can’t assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to shape an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are good at these elections – and that’s very well possible – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: In the not too far future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will rather become something like the “Europe of (super) nations” which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to get away from this project in the hope of engaging with the United States.
However, Washington’s increasing interest in the Pacific area is closer to the fact that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests—which also includes Berlin and Brussels to say what they can find.
I suspect that Scotland could run very well in a lighter European alliance if we maintain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same with Norway andining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against the savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to be responsible.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now, only in order to be forced from Berlin and Brussels to a savings policy.
Early puberty: growing faster
African-American and Spanish girls tend to reach puberty more than their white age partners, research shows.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is less expressed in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breast and sham hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is coming quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, shame and axle hair, as well as body smell, appear in girls earlier.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch (the appearance of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years until the menarch,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “French puberty in girls: The essential advice to cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test on how puberty progresses.
It’s controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it’s “prey” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth push before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrist can carefully monitor.
With faster progress, tests could be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatments for delaying a early menstruation and defence of another consequence: premature ageing of the bones, which ultimately can lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are oriented to the child’s age, development rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reticent in terms of drugs, but he explains: “The oppression of puberty can relieve behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their age companions.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” a woman remembers whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her friend circle.
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causal.
Boys come like girls earlier in puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine who created a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more than their white age companions.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, a early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions through the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys the face and shemale hair is growing earlier, the trend to a complete early puberty is not as expressed as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasize the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and sham hair is common even in babies and infants.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to let their pediatrician consult how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected,” says Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, the child normally responds well.
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it comes earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers struggle in the face of large orders over seat width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a debate about the width of seats in the tourist class on long-range flights, which indicates the sound of a bitter collision at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute is about the seat width that is offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those around which airlines are struggling most, but this clear space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus demanded a industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing says that airlines should decide.
The debate comes at a time when aircraft makers bet to sell even larger versions of their two-motor long-range aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the back of the aircraft is equipped – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the indicated economic results that the new mini-jumbo design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernized “777X” fases 406 people in the tourist class sitting, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten in a row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine in a row.
Air passengers often share Hiebe about technical details through advertising in the specialized press.
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed the donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, with the title: “Do you accept that?”
“Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In light of changing eating habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The length of the male average American in the 21st century is 100,8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rivals rely on a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body range of the newly buried “Jet Set” was smaller.
According to Airbus, research has shown that an additional inch (2,54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing complains Airbus’ figures on seats and says it’s not in the power of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight rates and facilities.
The company also explains, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really going on to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to do to be successful,” explains air cabin expert Kent Craver from Boeing.
They don’t want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about greater freedom of speech, but for manufacturers it will become increasingly a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could sustainably affect the U.S. or European export balance.
As Reuters first in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute about the new Jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements about the results partly depend on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats in a row will be compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777s.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than for currently used machines with ten seats in a row.
“Boeing therefore takes more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats in a row at the existing 777s pointed out that many passengers chose for the closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper flight rates.
“Eightteen-inch seat widths would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world traveling jet buyers even carry bandmass to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they appreciate the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-compression design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten seats, but has not yet sold, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offering wide seats on the shelves for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be overwhelmed, but it could disrupt the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make Smoking Pleasure Garus
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before testing on humans, further trials are needed, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have to experience that their nicotine need is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant flow of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice to whom nicotine was given contributed to their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the contrary, had taken a “outtime”, the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine has reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibodies that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower because it turns liver cells into antibodies factory.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine illness.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel any pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them drop the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi claims to have been influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption supervision.
The former NSW minister denies to have changed the arrangements for maritime displacement at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned hidden parts of three land on a state-controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC – Independent Commission Against Corruption) on Friday extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers in this way to extend package contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without an offer after their expiry in August 2005.
Now the accusation is found that Tripodi was aware of Obeids' hidden interest in the land, after Tripodi's former deputy staff chief Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday.
In the years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pressed on public tendering for the package contracts.
They were opposed and wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the package contracts for the Circular Quay companies, which invested $2.5 million annually to Obeids, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public procurement.
But he contradicts to have made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government’s patterns.
One of the ICAC telephone addresses showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a chief officer who was exchanged to the port ministry after he had worked under Obeid in the fishing office.
“Is the topic discussed in these telephone conversations the elaboration of the commercial deforestation arrangements?” asked deputy commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli aircraft attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in Syrian port Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile supplies to Syria.
Foreign workers with a 457 visa could be subjected to ‘reality test’
The government is considering a “reality test” for foreign workers with a visa of 457 as part of extended measures.
If the test is introduced, a criterion should be used to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door to bring family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former Lab Party deputy Maxine McKew had condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be perceived as insult by Australian neighbors.
“Strong statements such as ‘foreigners should stand back’ and ‘Australians first’ are a very unpleasant decline in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region have an echo of this historic object, I’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal covers twelve measures once planned by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who went to Sri Lanka for talks on human beings yesterday, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being prompted.
If the “authenticity criterion” is adopted, a visitor may be checked whether “the application is true in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company.”
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders, after in the past companies that first wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lanka asylum probably died of a heart attack after he had arrived on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for since his father’s death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
The Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
The British government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd is proposed to high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England already with the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed metro connection between London and West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capabilities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a trip time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our target for HS2 is a truly national trail network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We are going forward with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is a good news for Scotland.”
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called for Carmichael to “uncomprehensibly” engage in the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed metro connection has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections throughout the UK.”
That’s why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed metro connection in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and supplements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia
Australian air passengers will also continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones when they start and land, despite U.S. efforts to relieve the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so passengers can read, watch, or play ebooks on their devices during critical flights, if they are in the “flight mode”.
During most of the flight, passengers are permitted to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their ebooks when they start and land.
Australian airlines are monitoring the decision for the implementation of which the U.S. airlines have to do a lot of work, but do not pursue immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it will review the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical phases of flight in Australia continue to apply.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft,” it said.
The issue is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already conducted talks with the CASA on an extension of the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declares that it is open to changes, but these must be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the CASA authorization of electronic devices because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (drone entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it will continue to keep up with the current regulations.
“Our current guidelines show that electronic devices are not allowed to be used during the launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change it,” the company said.
The FAA rules apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will definitely look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects U.S. companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
You need to prove that your aircraft can tolerate the radio disorders by mobile devices, and modify manual, training materials, handbag programs, as well as customer delivery.
“After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use more portable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases, in poor sight, the crew will guide passengers to turn off the devices during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier devices should be safe stored under the seat or in the seats over the seats when they start and land.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, participating BVB supporters had provided light tracks for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced serious consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an unusual, almost already spentic acoustic that offered to the spectator until shortly before the Bundesliga match between the German vice-man Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guest fans were listening to their songs.
The Southern Tribune, where the most faithful - and most loud - BVB fans stand, first presented itself extraordinary silence: No songs, no soundtrack.
The Podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And all in front of the tribune, alone, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadium Prohibition."
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller, as always, as the first BVB player to enter the place, a short-term joyful burned up.
As his team colleagues followed, there was a loud singing and wounding sound - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribe there is nothing to do.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for holidays.
Only five minutes before the push, the Capo swallowed his podest—and the tension that was so far with his hands fled up in a loud scream when Dickel, as usual, asked about the mood on the rings in the stadium.
As the last was, as usual, the Southern Tribune on track - and finally here again, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the sound call "Winner stands up" came from the southern tribune, everything was again as usual.
The silence before was probably a response to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB accompanyers had thrown light tracks into the spectators and on the square - and almost Torhüter hit Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the top of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fans.
“There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement,” the BVB boss announced on Thursday night at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate action, Watzke prohibited Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
“I have banned it,” he said.
The Zero Tolerance Policy in Pyrotechnology cannot be abandoned.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various ways of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to choose one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of the next week.
“It’s going to be cutting off,” Watzke assured.
We can be wondering how the reactions on the South Tribe will then be.
Panda houses boom in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
In a panda house in the shopping center of Bendemeer in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armband, a ring and a pair of ear rings to be able to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house and all my money is inside,” Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars a month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the household debt increases – is so high that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, this week became the third panda house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Setting jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uninsured bank loan.
Typically, panda houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just a little above the 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, banking houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or income evidence, which is why loans are faster than banks can.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to puppy houses after families feel the pressure of increasing living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a mild financial policy in the developed economies, families with lower and medium income are looking for houses to balance the difference in a stagnant economy.
This week the rating agency Standard & Poor’s increasing budget debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia compared to GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, a 60% increase in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has just come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that in the face of increasing costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic heights in gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend of attaching personal items as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, approximately 70 percent of the lies in the city state’s 200 panda houses are gold.
The people say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put the grandmother’s gold chain down and get back next month.”
The largest Thai panda house operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer growth in its stores in the last few months.
The growth in the bond business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company funds it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some borrows have fallen into crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that bond houses not only pay more favourable interest than other borrows, but also did not directly raise the debt.
“Customers get the items they already possess, and the waste of personal valuable items does not increase the budget training,” she explains.
The loan business is socially increasingly accepted as short-term, guaranteed financing.
Also, not all people who use bonds are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’ shops to deposit gold bars and Rolex clocks, for which they get up to 60% of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social layer.
“These include wealthy people who in the short term borrow something for a business or an investment, or small who have to break the boundaries in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes you just need money very quickly.
NSA drops data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence agency Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany to uncover the increasingly broken NSA secrets.
According to the representative of the Green-Bundestage Hans-Christian Ströbele, during his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the former intelligence staff would speak to a German prosecutor's office or an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic healthcare
The Australian government stands on the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immortal measures" to eliminate a crisis caused by an elderly population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanese deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that, in our opinion, addresses the unique challenges the state faces,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million emergency aid for election benefits.
Further 2,600 operations, including ortopedic interventions and treatment due to gray star, will eliminate remains.
In addition, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better post-stay care, professional training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic health data recording in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas affected clinical staff told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister standed on a strict reporting and accountability duty of the Tasman government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-stop Commission will be established and aimed at ensuring that the State provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only benefit little if “they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasman public health system to a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for reacting to his urgent aid request, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that the federal aid will make a great contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the list of concerns,” Wilkie said.
According to the federal government, these election benefits will largely match the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today’s announcement is just a “plaster solution.”
“We are therefore in the current situation because the labor state government has pulled $430 million out of the health system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government is throwing almost a half-billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is inserting 300 million and then doing as if it’s the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that no one dollar of the rescue package will be spent for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also harder diet than necessary.
The 1760s French story tells the fascinating story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she is rebelled, she is faced with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superhero and becomes the object of an erotic fascination of another.

The feastful seriousness with which the film is told makes it also a miserable book shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, a surveillance group says
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas missile facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while severe collisions occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the Civil War three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date of
1 November, established by the Hague-based organization of Damascus to destroy or “inoperable” all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious schedule aimed at destroying all the chemical weapons of Syria by the middle of 2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has to start destroying the weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including senf gas and nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when struggles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, from which experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and warehouses, as the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which is tracking the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of these, there are 61.067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide details.
The struggles highlight the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against the time in the middle of a broken civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said they had completed the first round of the inspections and visited 21 of the 23 locations indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two sites were, according to the Syrian statement, “allowed ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there were moved to other said facilities that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I draw the hat before the courage and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been struggling in this civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, many members of the Alawites, for a division of the Shiite Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said a strong explosion occurred on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Injury for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who were killed in the 2002 bombing in Bali reacted angry about the judgment for the last of the founders, which was brought to court as Umar Patek believed to be killed by law.
Patek, who was fleeing for just ten years as one of the most sought after people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack.
With punishment, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder due to the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
A guilt was also made in a series of terrorist-related accusations, which counted a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on the Holy Night in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a lifetime imprisonment, even if it could have claimed the death penalty for the man, also referred to as “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bombmaker.
The decision has raised painful memories to June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction caused by Patek and his co-conspirates almost ten years ago.
She fought with tears and said Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow the footsteps of the other guy.
“You should put him in front of a shooting command,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day so that I will not have any other grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equalized to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 a.m., a massive bomb exploded in a small lodge parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide attacker let a rubber filled with explosives explode.
He fell into coma for a month after the attack and "starbed" three times while he hanged on a life-saving system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terror cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodshed and were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy should get the death penalty above all others.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounded many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand before the court.
He escaped almost a decade of detention, but was eventually captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. military forces killed the former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the talks, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided evidence that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terror groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has not shown any regret for how much suffering he has brought to other people.
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not conduct phone calls)
Flying passengers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not phone with the mobile, according to the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented, take away from the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training guidelines of the airline staff and the arrangements for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“According to the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
You can start them again only when the plane has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers must reboot them and do not allow them to reboot before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at departure, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been rebuilt for the use of Wi-Fi to larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, Chairman of the Professional Aviation Associate, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are honestly sorry that we have to feel as supervisors on this topic.
However, internet connections to browse, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to place smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the scrabble-like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave a American Airlines jet because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked on the airline.
And heavier devices such as laptops need to be stored as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile conversations during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not at the FAA.
FAA may ban certain electronic devices when launching and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the Traffic Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national traffic issues told CBS News, mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also interfere with transmission machines,” Rosenker said.
A consulting committee of the industry, which was established by the FAA to investigate this topic, last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to relieve restrictions on use.
Critics like Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become everywhere.
In some studies, it is said that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disorders of navigation and communication equipment were made known by UKW radio carried by passengers, which represented the latest technology trend at that time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that electronic interference makes them nothing.
The airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the airport height is reached.
Flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for a stronger use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally deliver significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-reader, for example, only emits minimal radiation when translated.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Among the removers of a lock of the restrictions for the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, corporate employees picked up a passenger plane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems, but no one could find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd from the National Association of Airline Passengers said he is the opinion that the disruption by the equipment is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there are only single reports of pilots who speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow the pilots to order the passengers to turn off the equipment when the instrument landed under poor sight conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would be entirely equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA acknowledges that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescue bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea Bay Island
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which was found exhausted on a North Sea Bay Island, was released back into nature.
The water rail was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was captured by the Scottish animal protection organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rail was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the Bohr Island.
He added, “He couldn’t fly further, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
At their release, the water roll was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s Elite Ready to Business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide wealth and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
For this purpose, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 managers from the industry, who represent the UK’s corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernize and grow while the states in the EU stagnate.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than to stop the long and challenging process of reforming the shy EU institutions.
Asked by their opinion on certain law-regulated issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that the control over these key competences should be taken back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as the companies said the costs of the Brussels regulations would now exceed the benefits of being part of the European trade zone – even 40 percent of the large companies agreed to those that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that’s probably the most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority desires a course from the UK towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not on politics.
This finding, found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a “sensitive change” that brings the shift of action back to the UK.
A change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change in opinion in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum by 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubts: This survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for membership in the EU.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift of power relations back to the UK from a new negotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the outcome of our survey shows what to means a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas line
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom’s chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as it is heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with the transit countries were "excluded forever".
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at advanced tariffs when the entire project is in operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subsidiary countries is expected to start on the scheduled route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, no way passes the real estate site Germany.
The economic framework data is right, and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic framework in the country in European comparison.
This was by Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, on the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange Journal.
As the German commercial real estate is sought to be, the look on the transaction volume shows, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK the plus was only 6%, in France at 19%.
“Immobiliary investments offer an attractive interest rate,” Ulbrich said.
The return gap between real estate and federal bonds is on a historically high level.
The FAA reduces restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if phone calls are still prohibited.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual misconduct
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual misconduct related to children before 2011 accusations were raised against Caringbah's child nurse Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children heard.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that “there has never been an incident of sexual abuse of children in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interrogated on a case in which one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was sentenced in 1991 for abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assisting lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second.
He noted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “this has provided external examinations of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognized as the leading front in child safety.”
Instead, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 at YMCA, stated that the management failed “from me down” to hold Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord was sentenced early this year for sexual abuse of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, claims that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said they had observed violations, among other things that Lord was alone with children, cared for her privately as a babysitter, let her sit on his shoulder, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose chairman was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was worried about her behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the chairman of Lord at YMCA Caringbah, was “very scary and most of the time was very inaccessible.”
The chief executive said he would not accept statements from the employees, according to which they would not dare to return the report to their boss.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord has affected their judgment, so they had not him.
Hare explained that he told the board of YMCA NSW his opinion that the lesson that the organization has to draw from the “Jonathan Lord Interval” is “not related to the reporting” by employees, and the board agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the accusations appeared was made by YMCA’s Children’s Services Director, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, which was “excessive” and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone from the Griffith University, an expert on sexual abuse of children, the Commission.
He explained that there were “serious problems” in the appointment, review, preparation, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take advantage of the possibility of a return as British Prime Minister, but he insisted that a return is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his departure, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as the head of state, Blair has largely avoided speaking about British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as a messenger of the Middle East Peace Founders Quarter.
On the question whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so ...”
When the horse-looking experts found themselves in Cardiff's shares to cut the horse of the year, they were aware that a harsh competition was ahead.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who is not even in the kindergarten and has made his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee slowly broke through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his plate mouths in a broken corner and led the two-year-old coffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony that are far above his age.
And Toffee received bestnots for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has since practiced every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great spanning.”
They had to compete against the entire championship and have left the square with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with coffee, and we were all excited when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his uncle Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over a decade.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electricity and everyone was shooting and shaking it.”
He ran on the sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so small, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmers and has two chickens he takes care of.
As it starts, it won’t take a long time until it’s on the “Honey of the Year” look – and I’m sure it’s going to cut it well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together you are a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee after how well they had hit themselves and presented themselves in the front round.
They look forward to good collaboration between Pony and the guide – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure that Fenton’s sweet clothes have contributed to its part that really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be “reformed”
A Chinese newspaper, which had on the title page demanded the release of a reporter accused of diffamation, should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted tax funds to falsify reports about a part-state company.
Now the New Express will be undergoing a “comprehensive rectification,” the regulatory authority said.
The “certification order” was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several false reports about the stock marketed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was irregular,” the regulatory authority said in a statement.
She said it was decided “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw from his reporter’s license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group was ordered to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant officials at the New Express and immediately check the New Express management team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two quotes for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and their ability to gain the trust of the public,” he told the state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and glory.
I realized that I did wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express posted an apology on the title page and stated that it had failed to correctly review the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions will still be routinely forced, despite a law change in the beginning of the year, in which the authorities were forbidden to force someone to blame themselves.
Drogentunnel with own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug mix between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters measuring tunnel as one of the finest passages they’ve ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in Zickzack pattern over a length of just six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide truck loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, the authorities said.
At the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were saved, the court records said.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatened with a prison sentence between ten years and a lifetime.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers put on an extensive underground network of dewashing channels.
The tunnel is the eighth big passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, making the drug cartel face the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a roughly 640 meters long passage with trains that passed from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love
Actress Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are going separate roads in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of Flynn.
Actress Orlando Bloom has spoken for separation from her wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which should be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly as we plan or expect it.”
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
“We will support each other and love each other as Flynn’s parents.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from this in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians are allowed to eat sandwiches, ice, or a strong edamer, these slurry aren’t on a vegan’s food list.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish, the vegan refuses to consume all animal products – honey is also denied.
What remains, you can wonder, but with a closer consideration, the vegan diet world is characterized by a significant insight.
“Brotaufstriche are very popular,” explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the home reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also pleases to visit the store in the Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds () everything he needs to live. "1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the end of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it was also in other everyday affairs without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor explains the maximum of vegans, which extends to the entire consumption behavior.
Instead of dragging burgers, rushers or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “in fact, being vegan does not represent a forgiveness, not an ascesis, but it’s an enrichment.”The assumption that you reduce the choice of food options with the dietary shift leads Proctor rather to the power of habit.
And this is exactly the conditioning that allowed some so well-intentioned attempts to fail.
“The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that makes many quickly quit, similar to when smoking,” Proctor makes a comparison.
He said, “Some tastes are not to be fixed on the animal.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that forms the taste.
"But you can produce the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For a grill party, Proctor brings, for example, Aubergines, Champignons and a few vegan crops.
He takes care of a balanced, varied diet, in which it should even taste fat.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
“It should taste, but it’s not just to reduce to animal food,” says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he has not suffered.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I do not take any foreign cholesterol and have an increased amount of vitamins.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
“My blood values are good, I often check myself,” Proctor tells me.
Especially from the lack of vitamin B12, many vegansimus critics warn.
“Because animals are fed with feed instead of grinding on the wheat, it’s questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator, the B12-percentage is high,” says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are okay,” he explains.
Large roads Proctor should not go for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the site.
Sometimes I buy something special.
“Many people ignore that only the finished products are expensive, but this is the case with ‘normal’ finished products as well.”
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally believed.
“In the kitchen there’s a lot to discover, with a few small knives you can get good, if not partially better results,” says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cake, Proctor could also surprise his grandparents.
Family feasts give the vegan a new virtue.
This has dynamics, when cooking together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was also skeptical.
Do you no longer taste my food?
"Do I have to feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a fingerprint feeling.
“I don’t deny the people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor does not want to terminate his existence.
And more accurately, the everyday world then does not seem as vegan-stranger as it is supposed – and the vegan does not be as limited in everyday life as it is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Potatoes are everywhere.
“Many Döner shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka,” Proctor says.
In a pizzeria, he disappears on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting into it.
“When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult,” the New Zealander can find a development: “You have to talk to people, make them careful about it.”
“When enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Combus in Mannheim or the Vogelfrei Café.
Proctor explains the desire that other restaurants also have at least one vegan dish on the dish.
Basically, vegan dishes are available for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
“Therefore, meat courts are exclusive, in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others,” says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of the front impossible," says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that even in nuts animal additives contain as color donors, one seems to quickly leave the courage with following ethics in so many obstacles and falls.
Not just that Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are filled with food but also cleansers.
“Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to, “It’s sometimes better to take small steps than standing or stumbling,” says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes on consciousness.
Per he doesn’t get it all by disregarding his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon.
In a statement, the operator was responsible for technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger panels with the stock exchange operator.
On Tuesday, the NASDAQ index was not calculated for an hour due to data transfer errors.
In August of this year, there were only two pannies in a week.
First, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively erroneous purchasing orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to check out and break the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock trade in the U.S. resulted in a computer panic on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
In the past year, Facebook’s stock exchange was also overlooked.
The Nasdaq systems had not increased the flood of purchasing and selling orders, later the stock exchange supervision SEC found and damaged the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constantine: Radler kills 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night, around 22 p.m., was on a female bicycle on the left walkway from the railway station to the marketplace.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man came to the walkway from a local, the bicycle driver could no longer freeze in time, according to the police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and pulled an approximately 15 centimeters long square to the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
British police approve Assange's extradition order
The British police have delivered an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and has requested asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that the 40-year-old Australian man was sent a “invitation to face” that urged him to appear in a police guard, adding that if he did not follow it, he would be threatened to be arrested.
Assange threatens to be extradited to Sweden due to the allegation of a sexual act after his possibilities under British law have been exploited since the Supreme Court rejected his objection against the extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States, he had sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has sent an invitation to a 40-year-old man to meet at a police guard at a time we chose,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The message did not comment on the transmission of the police request.
Assange is afraid that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and charged there for possible spy charges after he had published more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.
Drivers who drove with 210 km/h and a hot drink between their legs will receive a fine of £1,000
A driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police had arrested him, they found the drink bag between his legs.
In the court of Colchester, Howie confessed himself guilty without driving the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of £90 and a sacrifice fee of £100.
Tax for foreign real estate owners against London's speculation bluse
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily recalculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the budget of 2012 had imposed a 7% steam tax on houses that cost more than two million pounds as well as annual fees for buyers who hold houses as a company and not as individuals.
For now, the income from the housing tax in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which in the fiscal year 2012/13 was at £708 million, exceeds the income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, northeastern, northeastern, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increases in the tax on high-priced houses and the introduction of the related legislation against a handling, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, regardless of the effects of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more discretion in terms of buying real estate in London, or prevent owners from selling it,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy Southwest Gulf of London, ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon, had a record rate of 11.8% last year.
The prices in Central London showed an equal annual growth of 5.6%, but were overwhelmed by an emerging “inland market” on which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6,5%) experienced a rise trend, according to a survey by Savills.
Scientists were able to throw more light on what the connection of a dog's swing with his mood is.
Earlier research had shown that happy dogs with the sword wandered more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while in nervous dogs it was the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trient, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to their species’ side wings, the researchers monitor the animals while watching these movies of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the wave moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate disturbing other aspects, and so we were able to control the movement of the wing more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how a otherwise expressive dog moved the wing to the right (looking from the perspective of the winging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the fluctuation was mainly to the left ( again from the dog's perspective, the wedelt), then their heart rate increased and they looked unhappy.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
He is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not.
He said, “When you have different meetings with other dogs, and swelling with the wing in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior, and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and host scholarship at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when they are a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following stated: “Hunds are more likely to go to a robot dog when his ‘wheel’ walks to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming anxious – exactly differently than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore lead to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“There are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
But as their behavior will simply be recorded, it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the wave sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys Delay Show in Glasgow Due to Alex Turner's Disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead songwriter has been sick of cervical inflammation.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play in the Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of Leadsinger Alex Turner, the concert has to be displaced.
The announcement came after the band had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"Alex Turner was diagnosed with cervical inflammation, which is why, unfortunately, it cannot occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket owners for the inconveniences arising from this.
Please contact the customer service at the stations where you bought your ticket if you need further support.
Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February
Pope Francis will call for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope’s election – this falls to a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all the cardinals will be held before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to invoke the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be scheduled,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to be decreased by February.
He explained that a pope normally honors as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
Currently there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
40 percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it is “good possible” that Francis asks the cardinal for advice.
But so far we haven’t been in this position – it’s all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM calls new pickup trucks back in the U.S. to repair seat loans
General Motors will recall almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat leaf, a U.S. regulatory authority for vehicle safety announced on Friday.
For some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for the withdrawal of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines for Vehicle Safety.
“When the vehicle runs up from the back to the back, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the passengers, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the message was read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recovered models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main model start of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
NHTSA failed to check the notification due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on the automotive sales in October.
The sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were re-developed for the 2014 model year, have increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM’s stock on the New York Stock Exchange rose by 1.4% to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The discourse of a Obama voter
I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made praiseful efforts that have been devastated by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs of the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It’s a book I thought it would put me up during the sad second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and depicts the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient subtitles at night and go to bed, the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could steal the breath of a speech.
The election was held to be a trembling victory, and news speakers held to bring in mind the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama switched to office in 2008, he had 82% of the votes.
And then I finish the book.
Going back to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were pulled out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has actually changed.
But it’s just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the party-political blockade tactics has caught too many efforts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to mention only a few.
But after I have defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to the end with my explanation attempts.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign heads are allowed to hear or to kill innocent children by drones abroad.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that reveal state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, was murdered without proceedings, or why the public financing and expenditure boundaries were overturned during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon government.”
And ultimately, it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website over the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
If I was 18, I should have understood that the government’s work could contradict its upcoming political campaigns.
Obviously, the parliamentary office is not a predictable course as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely chosen by the government itself.
And that worries me most.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unsuccessful alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we have long heard of.
But with the decline of the approval values for Obama to below 45 percent this week, the return to 2008 by this book has become so harder.
It raises in me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to insert a serious loss against Clinton in the presidential elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It’s five years later, Mr. President, and I could not strongly agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests during parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and therefore could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a court dispute about paying $6 million CO2 tax, rejected the claim as he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important to decide whether the CO2 and mining rates will be cut or cut.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission declared Palmer officially the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat with 53 votes in advance.
Palmer called for a review of the voting process so that the voting process goes faster.
Tony Abbot's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system in which one enters, enters the data into a computer, immediately chooses and then at 6:30 a.m. has the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of blisters when marking the voting cards.
Do you use them because you can then remove the results if they don’t like you?
Nowadays it is incredible to deal with blisters.
The Election Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously”.
In a public office it is about the service to the public.
“We do not seek any reward except that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indicator that the global government investigation on the alleged manipulations in the currency market is moving rapidly.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they work with the authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 billion per day exchanges the owner.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that follows the Libor interbank scandal.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue are ongoing and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities,” the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation that the RBS had transferred the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is now expected to be resigned from his current position as the European leader of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European Spot Trading at Citi, was resigned this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct.
The Usher’s Instant Message Group belonged to banks at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma has stated that it is investigating alleged manipulation of the exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently addressing allegations that banks have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks scroll through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news about these investigations has put traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the chances for speculants.
Some banks have tried to down the deal and said it’s almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid exchange market, but leading traders believe that this isn’t necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by the banks will lead to “the market can be influenced by very low ticket prices.”
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that it had dismissed a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and is working with them.
“We are sure that the trader has handled alone and that the matter is confused,” Credit Suisse said.
The building is painted on the basement
A group of citizens’ initiative “Switzer Wiese” has decorated the building on the Bechtle-Grundstück at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
It also cleaned and spread the path, it is said in a press release.
Planned coverage of the crashing house in the back of the ground was not allowed for security reasons, as the ground threatens to disappear.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI on the clearance action.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message with the message "We are for it" was applied.
However, about 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative had little to interfere with their action.
Their motto on the big poster was “We are against buildings.”
Thus, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss village - if the giant project one day fails.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building site" it became clear that some citizens believe that it will go much better with the implementation of the city project, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they begin to resign because the city further delays these answers, the BI says.
As it was heard, the public statements of the mayor are also influenced.
May had said in the municipality meeting that he was afraid of the exit for the thermal bath, if the citizens voted against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss basement.
Some seem just so scared, others feel it as a “plump attempt of extortion” in the population, it says in the press release of the BI.

Rangnick keys for Schiris: Mane is not a shell king
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick is with the current high shape of the Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg too, so disappointed the sports director of the "Bullen" showed himself from the judges.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the category of shell kings," he said on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The latest reason for Rangnick’s criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where Senegales became a alleged acting – which was no, as the TV images showed.
“It’s a crazy mistake,” said Rangnick, who called the judge Harkam “fullly overwhelmed.”
Harkam had also contributed to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German landman with discretion: “I would have behaved in every situation the same as Roger Schmidt.”
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the shock with Hütter.
I don’t know why.
“Because I’m the one who was offended,” the 46-year-old said.
In view of the success course, Rangnick voted for a praise.
“There are only two words for that: really good,” he said.
There is not much to stop.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It should continue so quietly.
Framework changes in the winter transfer period will hardly occur.
There is no great reason to change anything.
“Unless a player comes with the desire that he wants to leave the club,” Rangnick said.
Supreme Court confirms Obama’s health law
It’s a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces U.S. citizens to complete a health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also stated that the provisions of the Health Act that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise abolish all state Medicaid claims are not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit against the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was decisively rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian towns make light with huge mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sunrise, the rjukan located in the Westfjord valley from autumn to spring normally disappears in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century nightmare took place on Wednesday.
“Finally!” said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony on TV2.
Some inhabitants put their solar chairs up, while others put their sun glasses up for safety.
So far, sunny hungers had to travel to a nearby peak in the winter with a railway.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally approved the costly project of 5 million crowns (around 615 000 euros).
A similar design has been providing winter sunlight to the Italian alpine town of Viganella for a few years.
Posts are hardly empty on Sundays
“Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red points for Sunday learns are still located on various postcoins of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the learns on Sundays and holidays will no longer take place,” the FDP said.
A FDP request confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten there is still Sunday, the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to go here.
Sunday lesson is an important post service at the time post.
"These thin this enterprise despite the price rise for letters in January 2013 is radical and unacceptable."
Thomas Bittner, the head of the Fraktions and City Association of the Liberals, supports his counterparts: “What irritates me is the fact that here the vacation times are changing or deleted.”
From citizens nearby the post is a mile away.
"At least the postal boxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be drawn again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also for the core city, especially non-mobile citizens should be able to reach a postal box with Sunday learning also foot-by-way.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament if the city administration planned conversations with the post on this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
According to him, there is a Sunday lesson in Hofheim.
The party has voted for privatization.
“There will be decisions made elsewhere,” Mayer said.
Parking fees in Frankfurt will rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensitively expensive.
The city’s magistrate will consult this morning on a proposal by transport department Stefan Majer (Greece).
Parking fees will be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase the prices, but to shorten the time interval of parking and parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt Retail Committee says this is "not a good idea".
Parking right in front of the store is “a not to underestimate advantage for smaller professional merchants.”
The Transport Club Germany is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "commonly appropriate and actually long-lasting".
Public transportation will also be more expensive.
City: Fast actions overwhelming hosts
With a small frame, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Schwäbische Alb.
The Elblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it turned out that, even because of age, they were unable to comply with the rapid actions of the pleasant cities.
With the hard and placed attacks, the Gönninger faced themselves extremely hard.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly played through the network center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first winnings clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasant cities in all matters.
Given this repressive and play-defining performance, the third sentence was then a little loose and unpleasantly won to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to clearly settle in Nagold, a significantly stronger opponent will stand on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt stood against.
They delivered a hard-competitive two-hour match.
Nervosity on both sides caused mainly errors and points gifts when taking the ball; even in the passes, accuracy was sometimes a defect and in some critical play scenes the correspondent prevented the sight of possible points gains.
In this performanceally very balanced meeting in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto, however, the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams agreed.
Day of Care at the Little English Cottage
For the fifth day of care following the Natura 2000 project of the Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English house in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view to the valley should be opened on that day in the area of the house, mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many walkers, according to Emperors, described this area as the brightness of the slope, on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for magnificent views.
He thanked the present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the day of care is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Presidium of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the shrimp and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the widow is covered with the aim of preserving the now highly grown old allmendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing wheat.
Certain species such as rare worms and grapes cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free connections for species maintenance.
Tribukait said she would not miss it here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current measure is not merely inserted.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous supplementation of what has been achieved with the Life project as well as the previous care dates for the future.
Following these various statements, Revier Leader Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the assistants into groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in advance, the forest crawler is likely to be ready for calling.
A group of assistants should take care of the release of vigilant bushes and the care of a dry stone war.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Löffingen: Köpfler remains the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the city of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an untouched infrastructure, a future-oriented school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own urban works can be referred to as an attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet been.
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer candidate for reasons of age, the 46-year-old bank shopper and businesswirt Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has been established.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11 at 18 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday strengthened a lawn of claims for patent breach against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was overbounded by it during Nortel's insolvency billing.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, prosecuted Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent breaches before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is co-owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with breach in seven cases.
The patents are technologies that match search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus touches the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are producing phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial order of more than $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $4.4 billion.
After it was overbounded with the Nortel patents by Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library on patents.
“Al Google failed with its attempt to acquire the complaint patent at the auction, Google has violated the patent and continues to do so,” the complaint letter said.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google as it claims that Google’s patent breach is intentional, according to the accusation.
Egypt celebrates first free-elected president
Mohammed Mursi resigns his office, but his day of triumph may not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was appointed as the first freely elected president of the country and thus the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months ago.
With his appointment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi became the first free-elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the collapse of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He made the swear before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black rubs, which has its seat on the Nile and is found in an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, an U.S. trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been widely taken into vision since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a prohibited organization by the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to admire the new president, and unlike the presidential prunk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the car convoy could cross the commonly lived road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As the uncharismatic “heritage wheel” of the Brotherhood has swallowed, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as the candidate of the Islamists, but to all those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 rebellion against the autoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today,” Mursi, dressed in a blue dress with a red cravate, told the judges in the wooden hall where he held his office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his speech.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national hymn he listened to.
The military leader Field Marshall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the university’s largest hearing hall with speeches of “The army and the people are one hand.”
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has evolved in the 1970s into a Hochburg of Islamist student groups.
Mursi held a symbolic swear on Friday on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion that last year led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule, and he promised to revoke the presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the chief of state hunted out of office.
But by giving the official jury before the court and not as usual before the parliament, he runs to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursis' speech on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides for two great nights
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
Today’s Friday evening is called “Pump this party”, and tomorrow’s Saturday evening it will continue with a U25 party.
Fatty beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers of course on both days.
Workers collapse from head: seriously injured
During the replacement of a defective external sensor on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a driver and wounded himself seriously.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to exchange a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a hostel.
When he climbed to the roof-to-cover roof, the roof dropped away, and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was transported with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg National Hospital.
South African murderer sentenced to life two times
Nine months after the brutal rape and torture of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the murderer was sentenced to life twice on Friday.
This was by SABC.
The victim was later killed by the consequences of serious injuries.
John Khan was found guilty earlier in the week of the crime.
The incident caused anger across the country.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial village in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors struggled for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but in vain.
The views of the youth were so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with boys in the night of the incident.
He also claimed to have hit and rape them, but he denounced to be responsible for the girl’s death.
Police had initially identified several murders, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The prosecutor also emphasized during the trial that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
In South Africa, rape is almost everyday: annually there are about 64,000 cases of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times the number in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure in sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest
Jumbo in search of the "best shink of the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the very beginning: the most important thing for the shinking is the pig shells, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can the shink you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large shink factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
“Deutschlands Liebling Schinken,” as Jumbo announces the Black Forest Schinken.
Only with hair protection and kits it comes to the inside of the factory.
Jumbo must first disinfect his hands before he can touch the micro.
Jumbo for Strengthening at Fastimbiss in Waldshut
"Here I'm working smellful amounts," the television makers wonder, the black forest shink as a mass product.
16,000 Kules speak for themselves every week.
Weight, fat proportion, color: Uli explains what matters in terms of quality.
Most pigs are killed in six months.
Television at the level?
Details such as the ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
“I’m looking forward to seeing you missing Roberto Blanco what’s going to happen,” Jumbo said cynically.
Here is presented the level of private television in Reinkultur.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the breakdown of the Cologne remains a handwork.
For: Black Forest shinking is traditionally found without bones in the plate.
The secret of sweetening is the mixture of spices with salt.
Smoking tower and smoke firing jumbo visually remind a "U-boat".
The trick: Teeth wheels provide the special taste of the black forest in the smoke here.
Twenty days in smoking make the shink almost black.
“Now the disc disappears in Jumbo,” he announces the test feed.
“It’s really nice,” the TV star said.
This will allow all participants to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenue from tourists in Australia and the UK.
The travel company is now out of a refined annual income from taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to a record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start in the second half, especially in Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are on a good way towards record annual income before interest and taxes,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are typically one of our strongest outcomes.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, resulting in a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it worked well for the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK, while also here the business customers spent less.
The U.S. trade has recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so for the third year in a row a profit is expected for the entire year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose yesterday by 3 cents to $38.20.
Schools will focus more on mathematics, rhetoric and grammatics
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a novel of the 19th century, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The exam also includes “unpredictable texts” to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Starting in 2015, students must submit an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed.
Other core fields will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Supervisory Authority for Examinations, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new use system and less coursework.
In a summer speech, the Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there is a "bread consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence", emphasizing that the GCSEs would be "the more challenging, more ambitious and more strict."
Studies show that English schools spend less time in mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore’s students receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive mathematical examination – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to set more hours.
The curriculum will focus more on “problems from the right life”, including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different races and colour slopes present the circles performance show this weekend in the House of Citizens.
The assessments were made on Thursday.
Again, the W514 municipality is organizing this large exhibition.
Farmers of the Soest circles show here their best animals as well as young wicked hobbies their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges took the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum
The next Ecumenical Dialogue Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle discusses the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological considerations on today's dealing with the last things."
Referent is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church communities of Salem, the Castle of Salem and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to follow in the forum the question of how today the people do the “last things” after death.
If the people had known too much of it in the past centuries, and put on those images of heaven and hell, “which shape our ideas until today,” then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of accomplishment would rather be characterized by some confusion or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope is that Christians have been expelled by religious criticism,” the referent says.
She provided us with so many questions that the calls seemed to have come away.”
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the anger of death.”
This is linked to the question of that desire, "who dreams that at the end everything may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg.
She graduated in 1997 to Dr. theol, also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been teaching systemic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Little Heuberg confirm their faith confession
In two divinities, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the Soul Care Unit Am Kleinen Heuberg were forged.
The divine service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si in the morning, and the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sakrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and praised the power of the Holy Spirit.
In the past few months, the firmmen, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the municipality, had prepared for the great holiday.
In various projects, they learned about the various tasks of the Christian community and experienced the youth day in Submachtal together.
Illmensee: The second mountain bike race excites participants
With wonderful weather, 214 cyclists arrived in Illmensee to take the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing Sportsverein Illmensee.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of height, there were also numerous all-man runners who once wanted to exercise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German Championships.
Both of them were able to leave the field as expected.
Like last year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time advance to the goal and defended his title as the total winner of the short-distance.
In the second place, Pascal Treubel was able to place again.
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team Albtraum, who managed to get to the top of the victory.
On place 2 and 3 came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range was represented by athletes.
The age structure also reached from ten years in the youngest to over 70 years in the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to get rid of the top regional drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk racing team.
Pangerl, along with a team colleague, has already been two times world champion in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became European champion in this specialty.
With this also Roland Ballerstedt, who has already two German championships in the duathlon calls his own.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of height, it came to a wimpernschlag final in the target run in front of the Three Lake Hall.
Pangerl ran first over the target line.
Just a second later, the routine Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came to the target as a third of the overall assessment.
In the dam rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen before Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and assistants showed themselves very pleased with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Travelling through slam, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to displaced villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients.
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people.
Go here or with your mobile device.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 of CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his sick father constantly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that had no means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then a inflammation formed, which spread to his brain and there caused a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There was no neurochirurgs in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
“It’s not easy,” says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles' father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor per 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
On the contrary, the ratio of a doctor in the United States is for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroons could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty limit and almost three-thirds of the health expenditure in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Having seen his father and so many of his peoples suffered, Bwelle made the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas in the weekend and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people are forced in small buses and riding with the crushed medical equipment on the roof through unrestricted land into the villages in need of help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to throw the vehicles through rivers and slams.
But when they arrive, they will be received as heroes: a party dinner, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with its broad smile and its unlimited energy – is pleased to participate in the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team then starts with the examination of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from a range of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated due to malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others get cracks, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local poisoning.
Operations usually take place in a school, council or apartment; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator and thus Bwelle and its volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s an effortless pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They throw the whole night so that we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a spine break he received now enables him to work again.
“This changes the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he funds 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s going to sleep,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and is volunteer in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or tries to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experiences that they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help to drop blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated health care materials with them.
But if they are first in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He is undoubtedly a hero,” says O’Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he has given to his Father makes him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” says Bwelle.
I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellent management of the battle
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway novel "The old man and the sea", is cut on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson is himself an old sheep in his metier, the art of play.
For the old man Santiago, no one can do anything when fishing.
Thus, the two complement greatly.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman Manolo talks.
When Santiago is tired of life, sitting on the chair, that’s true with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masteres excellently.
Hemingway tells the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and his will.
Janson is on a wide range as a single actor on stage.
He manages to focus the audience’s attention on himself, so his monologues are not a moment boring.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made up of only blue-lighted water bottles.
Directed by Jens Hasselmann, the old man is on the boat in front of the fishing village.
During the performance, he sets the active scene into light: the Hütte of Santiago, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who with her songs and her magnificent voice shines the sense of life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: descent to the Romans
About 120 meters long, under Cologne is a wastewater canal from the Roman era.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass through the temple.
Around 157 meters, the two towers rise into heaven and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigranic church towers guess that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne subworld.
The meeting point for its guides is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the Dom.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: “We start in the deep garage,” says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a self-righteous city, and therefore the remains of the old city wall remained only that which was not too large.
The majority of the users of the parking lot, therefore, today also rush through the Roman remains and only put their car off.
But whoever looks closer, finds in the park deck D2 an archaeological discovery point separated by metal stains.
There are about five meters high ruins made of handtell-sized stones.
“There are remains of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century after Christ,” Schulze tells.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper parking level take a look at a darker, 15 meters deep boat.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the tour is the Pretory, and here the participants rise down again into the depths.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preacher of the CCAA.
What CCAA means a visitor wants to know.
The abbreviation means "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the Emperor's cult."
And the Pretory is the former State Palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the outskirts of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which isined here at about 120 meters long.
“You can quietly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want,” Schulze tells the guests.
Another surprise is Schulze.
After he has taken the key from the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, accessible box.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the ground water that was indispensable for the ritual washing.
Until today, in the lower end of the Mikve, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water stages can be read through the changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town square, for which the construction work is scheduled to begin soon.
But it will take a few years until completion.
Next Next post: The Foot Nearly Hacked: Renewal of Rocker Process
A bloodshed attack in the Rocker environment is rebuilt after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous body injury and material damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in front of the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The accused is silent at the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rock scene and then heard of the bandidos.
The Prosecutor's Office accuses them of hitting and attacking three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown complaints in Finowfurt.
All of the victims were seriously injured, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims were to have heard of the competing group Hells Angels.
One of them was a senior member from Berlin.
It appears that there was a pursuit with several cars.
According to the accusation, it was a revolt and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were released in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloodshed.
The victims were wearing masks and were not identified.
The Federal Court of Justice submitted the judgment after the prosecutor's review and returned it to the Land Court for re-judgment.
One of the accused is currently in prosecution for another offence.
The initiative was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the Tatnacht.
As a witness, the commissioner who was then investigating was charged.
In the center were calls of the accused and other people who had heard the police.
It’s hard to say that Rocker almost always adheres to a law that is true to them before the court – and not to say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had been packed out.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Prosecutor's Office of Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces have been revealed since the last proceedings.
Another 11 days of trial are scheduled for the process.
The society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bows of the people on the passenger and back seat, hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, the one or the other cocktail or sect can be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to give yourself a little bit?
I acknowledge I would like to be with when it comes late night or early morning to fast food hole.
A few potatoes, a Cola, a Burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco players become noticeable.
For what should one lack that you regularly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Particularly on the weekend, removed paper tires are on the streets and on parking spaces.
“Why?” I wondered.
Are the people too stupid to take the bags with them home or up to the next moulders?
It’s not just that the paperwork is scattering the landscape.
The roofs have also already hidden traffic facilities such as guidelines, causing accidents.
About what thinks said "Wegwerfgesellschaft" but not after, probably she doesn't even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more frequently in the evening, just with a few people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other waste turns there.
There would be a few pockets more or less - unlike the street, where no one wants to roll on the food remains of others.
I see that the day will come when the cities and communities will be too foolish – and the fast food chains will have to demand money for their bags.
Obama's retreat in health policy
After strong criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal in his frequently repeated, clear promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurers, the Republicans in recent days warned the president that he had deceived the American public.
Obama has relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them,” he said in a Boston speech.
In response to the numerous media reports about the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance on the free market.
Most citizens could thus get a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than expected.
“You get a better offer,” he said.
The government stated that it was not surprising that five percent of the population who have signed an insurance themselves would have to rethink a different tariff as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to say directly to these Americans that they deserve better,” Sebelius said in a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
“I’m as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to restore your confidence.
This speech of a dismissed Sebelius to a consultant behind her at the House of Representatives hearing yesterday was received after a dispute with the Republican deputy Billy Long from Missouri, which was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly wondered why the “architectin” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up a state-funded insurance to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which he now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government confirms no attack on Syrian airbase
A U.S. government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, said on Thursday to the U.S. news channel CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" which the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN said.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab radio Al-Arabiya had previously that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot in the night of Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis made it responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which were seen Russian defense missiles of the type S-125 Newa as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry explosive heads up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official saying he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defence Ministry said, “We do not comment on these reports.”
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, in part successfully, tried to deliver ground-air missiles to Hisbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any Syrian attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry declares in an unprecedented confession that the U.S. spy has “goed too far”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, pointed out a deviation of the U.S. defensive attitude regarding its surveillance programs, saying that the spying in certain cases “was gone too far.”
The Minister of Foreign Affairs also admitted that he, in conjunction with Barack Obama, deceives the responsibility for “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA’s spy activities were made public.
Through the disguised information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of disarmament from its allies.
In a video broadcast speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have learned about some things that have passed almost by autopilot, simply because they have been able to do what goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to the 11th September.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that the U.S. spy has crossed a border, but also emphasized that no rights have been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The president is determined to create clarity, and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there is abuse.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be affected in this process.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good, and through its monitoring operations many lives were saved.
He added, “We have to do with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is disappointed in killing people, blowing into the air and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to catch and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to spread the concerns about alleged U.S. spying and convince Europeans of the need to continue cooperating with the U.S. in the anti-terror efforts, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he talked this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and is concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over the National Security Agency’s monitoring.
“It is very important for the U.S. national security interests that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who is the first Democrat in the Senate and is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to clarify there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their trouble with the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telefonds in Europe have burdened the relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other disclosures cited from documents shared by Snowden, according to which the NSA has monitored the cell phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence service, James Clapper, defended the spying of allies as necessary and stated that this is common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority is preparing the Congress's trip to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being prepared.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be a few “serving words”.
He said the European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programs they have been deploying for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also deal with the fact that we are not the only ones to spy,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and to Poland to discuss the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the U.S. monitoring activities.

Australian woman calls for prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for faultly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released for deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the videos of a video camera showed that she was safe to enter her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she claimed to have invented the story.
Until the trial, she was in police guard.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day imprisonment in a low-security prison on the Phuket border, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League who has addressed the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “extremely concerned” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to get her back to Australia.
“Naturally, we are very worried, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 bahts on free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the meantime she is making a vacation in the resort Krabi in South Thailand.
The court’s advice was to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of the traveler wife Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand might be trying to improve its affected tourist image, and therefore it comes to a free speech.
