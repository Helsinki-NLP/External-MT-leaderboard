In Europe, inflation has spilled over into food
The accelerated inflation, as measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were higher than forecast, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg reported.
Official forecasts have only suggested 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the key interest rate by saying that the fall in interest rates, together with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment, would lead to the creation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep inflation below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, this is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we need to deter" inflation so that we do not have to intervene on this subject later.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent is a record for the last 12 years, and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has soared as a result of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
The forward market shares of cereals have risen by 88 per cent and the price of soybeans has also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price has risen 52 percent, and last month, a barrel of black gold was worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will fall from 2.1% in 2008 to 2.5% this year, but will fall to 1.9% in 2009.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 percent, however, the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly in early December, so that it now has the highest number of supporters since 2002, while Gallup (Polling Institute) has never before seen such low socialist support, namely 13 percent.
For the loyal voters, the difference would represent, due to the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two percent in the entire population.
Of the loyal voters who were certain to go to the polls, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who considered the economic situation of the country to be particularly serious has never been higher, it stands at 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent of the supplementary figures the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of last spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population expects the situation to worsen and only one tenth expects it to improve.
Last December, 71 per cent of those polled, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, thought the Prime Minister was doing his job rather poorly than well.
13 percent of the respondents have confidence or a lot of confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent the president of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society that believes that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 percent of those polled wanted the government and the prime minister to remain in office, the current figure is only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) believing that holding new elections would be the solution to this situation.
When asked about their intention to vote, 60 per cent of those surveyed said they would certainly vote and an additional 20 per cent said they would probably vote.
To make a comparison, for a "legislative election next Sunday", only 55 percent of those polled would certainly participate and an additional 15 percent would probably participate.
74 percent of people would say no to tuition fees for higher education, 79 percent would say no to consultation fees and 84 percent would say no to hospital stays.
When we look only at the same proportions among the people who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital stays.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has raised its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs shopping triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent from last year, with the difference that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article from Napi Gazdaság (Economy of the day)
This year, in the Budaörs shopping triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, with a value increase of well over one thousand forints in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already soared in large food stores in December, have not risen sharply from the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased for well under 9 000 forints last year now cost more than 10 000 forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003 this figure was 6,800 forints.)
Prices of Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices of turkey net, nut and poppy have risen sharply.
In the shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Statistics Institute), but in Auchan, one kilo of bread was found at only 139 forints.
Competition has not lowered the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this supermarket, that the price of the registered two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola was less than 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the registered bottle included.
However, this year, in terms of daily basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora raised the price of her daily basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan raised them by about 18 and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing last year's most expensive basket and this year's cheapest basket, we see a 12 percent gap whereas the difference between last year's cheapest and this year's most expensive is 21 percent.
Prices have increased by an average of 1 480 forints.
Last year prices increased by an average of 1 206 forints, although the impact of the VAT rate increase was already noticeable in last year's Christmas prices.
This process has confused the trade, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products because they were unable to predict the impact of price changes on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the turnover of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adjusted for the intensity of the trade.)
Due to the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the Daily Basket has been so excessive that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year the difference was not so great, since the most expensive basket was worth 1 630 forints more than last year and the prices of the cheapest also increased by 1 284 forints.
As we approached the two Christmas seasons, we saw a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of everyday consumer goods in supermarkets increased by more than 30 per cent.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some basic foodstuffs, the statistical institute has recorded a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and eggs.)
According to the daily newspaper, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, which was already very expensive last year, has risen by barely more than 10 per cent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have succeeded in getting the sharp price increases accepted by multinationals as well.
In the golden triangle of commerce, hypermarkets do not complain, they record consistently good years.
In our experience, most customers no longer look at the prices in the three hypermarkets they visit.
They buy everything in plenty, they take the food that's been stored for a long time in pallets.
On Wednesday morning, large queues formed at the checkout booths of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, turnover is less important in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for durable consumer goods.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the improper use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, and the overworking of medical staff do not help to stop infections, says the chief medical officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals are also saving on disinfectants
Recently, a MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
Earlier this year, a similar infection occurred in the same area.
The victim of a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital but soon afterwards had to return due to an MRSA infection and since then doctors have been unable to perform a major operation on him because of the bacteria in his body.
As of 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by a multi-drug resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Hospital Monitoring System, said Karolina Böröcz, chief medical officer at the National Centre for Epidemiology.
That is, the number of infections caused by a multi-drug resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry the Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without developing disease.
Infections caused by AS (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily curable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacteria that respond well to antibiotics will develop a resistant bacteria that will proliferate rapidly in poor hospital conditions.
If the immune system is temporarily or prolongedly dysfunctional, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, in elderly, low-weight or weakened patients.
According to the head doctor of the János Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not found only there or not looked for, said Tibor Nyulasi.
The A.S. is resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff puts on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have suitable antibiotics to treat them", said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients in hospitals are usually tested for MRSA, but infection cannot always be prevented.
Sampling is not in vogue
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is most prevalent in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor inpatients and isolate MRSA patients immediately.
However, microbiological sampling is not in vogue in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not finance these exams.
Most cases only occur if MRSA infection is detectable in the patient, said the head physician of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines also for the treatment of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be carried out to prevent drug resistance but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in outpatient and primary care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals are saving on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA spreads from one patient to another, most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash hands, wear gloves and face masks, but there are significant gaps in hospitals in this area as well.
MRSAs are spread by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact, however, because of the conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, the beds are often too close together, whereas in epidemic terms, patients should be kept at least 1.5 metres apart.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals in financial difficulty are saving on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are followed, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA infection is an exorbitant expense for the Social Security funds, which is why we are fighting this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this programme is effective and MRSA infections are showing a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lists as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, who caused the fatal accident, was not intoxicated
The official statement of the fatal accident caused by the 22nd Ward Commissioner has been drawn up.
It is possible that the 22nd district commissioner, who has since resigned from his post, who ran over a pedestrian causing his death last Tuesday, would have driven while drunk or dizzy, Attila Morvai, spokesman for the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital, said on Friday after the relative finding was established.
The findings confirmed the first result of the investigation which had already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before he took the wheel
Last Tuesday, the former 22nd Ward police chief ran over a 55-year-old man who was in front of him when he turned his car around on Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd Ward, trying to cross the road without going through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, as the Highway Code requires a car starting a turn to let pedestrians through.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
Following the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and asked for his retirement because, according to the police report, the accident had upset him deeply.
The investigation of this case is being conducted by the Budapest Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates in charge of the investigation.
EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Hungary's Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday for a credit line worth a total of EUR 400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environmental projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, for which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties.
The agreement on the EUR 150 million loan also concerns the budgetary financing of projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later following the extension of the loan agreement.
The parties have signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place in the framework of the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the project for the metro line 4 was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible modification of the original contract once Hungary had finalised the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants loans at the EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of eight years and without a commitment fee.
Bulgaria, a haven for the EU housing market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, and the attention of the whole of Europe is now focused on this little-mentioned Balkan country.
What, or who, bought on this EU market which is still the cheapest but which will soon become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Bulgaria is now undoubtedly the most popular destination for real estate in Eastern Europe, with its cheap ski resorts and seaside homes.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Sunshine Coast", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more people are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also attract investors and more and more people are also buying in the very cheap corner of Ruse.
The capital Sofia also offers attractive opportunities, with shops and office space offering the highest depreciation rates.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golfing paradises in Europe and thus a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The more vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people who buy a building in Bulgaria are also looking to change their life - their way of life.
Most of the buyers are British but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly from Romania.
The Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present.On the Black Sea coast and in the most renowned ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who want to move in buy renovated buildings, at a price of between 50 and 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price of between 5 and 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and in general to the local doctor.
The second group includes second-home buyers (since last December, Bulgaria has been listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of gaining value in the medium or long term.
The price of buildings in the capital is rising steadily as a result of the ever-increasing demand.
Bulgaria has the lowest house prices in the European Union, but over the last five years they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices is essentially greater than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian Six Percent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals will end on Tuesday, however, on Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries will discuss the Bali Roadmap, which is supposed to define efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol emissions reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are lively discussions on this subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that it was not willing to discuss exact figures at the moment, but was willing to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 percent by 2020 compared with 1990 levels.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries will commit themselves, in addition to reducing emissions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, likely under the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit) said.
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister for the Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to remain the flagship of the global effort to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, irrespective of the successful signing of the "Agreement after 2012", and is ready to reduce them by up to 30% if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries are also willing to make commitments commensurate with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol signatory countries had set a total reduction target of 5.2 per cent and all 15 EU members at that time committed 8 per cent less.
Hungary has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared with the 1985-87 level, the Ministry of Environment said in a press release.
The stakes are high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be implemented within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be delayed beyond 2012. In this case, reduction commitments below the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system for reducing emissions, the need for which was highlighted in the new report of the IPCC, the international scientific body that has won the Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British Army units are sharing video recordings from their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on the video-sharing site in an effort to make themselves popular.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) has become a fan of YouTube, with special forces in Afghanistan uploading videos of their operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are monitored at the Air Force Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to London where compatriots upload them to the Internet.
Political message is unavoidable
The Air Force soldiers have already uploaded 139 videos via this channel and their "channel" has been watched by over 75,000 people.
The UK Ministry of Defence signed up as Defence Headquarters in spring 2007 and it releases videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peace Keeping Force in Iraq (IPF) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the original purpose of the Air Force, the videos were posted on the net for recruitment purposes. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the general public aware of the real purposes of the military presence abroad.
The propaganda that is spread through this channel costs practically nothing compared to the usual television recruitment ads, said Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message, since it justifies in a special way the legitimacy of military operations decided by the government.
The Americans have a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been passed on the sharing site that also show, for example, the death of soldiers: in the official propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never show the bloody side of the battle.
In fact, many videos had already been posted online showing the real-life operations areas in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British Army only recently got busy uploading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently using the free downloadable shoot 'em up game America's Army, in which the player can directly take the place of the soldiers in a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and donuts in the ministry
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a party with live music, yet another will charm officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffets, that's how the power is entertained.
The public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be hosted by the Ministry of Defence but Ministry employees will not be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for Missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also be held.
The Ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere for the end of the year.
Compared with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4 320 000 forints and, of the 600 employees wholesale, 350 are expected there.
At this party, the Christmas atmosphere will be strict, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held on Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and a dinner.
The rent of the hall cost one million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that a department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, the company responsible for the tendering process.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for this purpose.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt as we have not been able to reach the person responsible.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building was not only the home of the NFÜ but also of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of a Christmas party organised a St. Luke's Day ball on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its halls.
There were 500 people at that ball.
The party began with the minister's welcoming words and the dinner was followed by a dance night with live music.
Answer to [origo's] question: party attire was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are planning a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, inside its walls, for 400,000 forints.
However, Mónika Lamperth, Minister for Labour, does not officially invite her employees to a Christmas party but to a year-end work meeting.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to a coffee and donuts, the press service reported, and the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister for Local Government, will simply invite his staff to a drink in the auditorium of the Ministry of Local Government and Land Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will hold a Christmas party in its large hall where 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since János Veres' arrival, the employees of the PM have been celebrating Christmas in the same way every year.
There is no festive atmosphere, the official character is reinforced not only by the Minister's presentation but also by the time of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on January 20th to celebrate the new year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the City Wood, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the 100 guests.
According to the press service, it will be a very simple cocktail party to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
The annual cocktail party begins with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a simple meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, their respective press services told [origo].
The press service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, over four hundred people were invited to the party at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike are gathering
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike committee on Friday, which will be responsible for coordinating the indefinite strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the health insurance law, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause significant traffic jams as rail traffic will be almost completely stopped and the employees of BKV (public transport company) will also strike until 1pm.
The trade unions of the league will announce on Friday afternoon the details of their strike on Monday, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA-MOSZ will also be formed, it will serve as the coordinator of the actions of Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and, starting on Monday, the organisations joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the parliamentary vote on the law on health insurance, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
If the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide what to do next.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the health insurance law will not take place until late in the evening, or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are expected: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are likely to be shut down.
At the same time, in different parts of the country, half the road will also be blocked.
Many unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call, the list of which is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organisations are reporting indefinite strikes, others have declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Union of Rail Workers (VDSZSZ) had not been able to reach an agreement on minimum services, and as the Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current reports, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1 p.m., Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the Electricity and Thermal Energy Industrial Unions of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for a strike for 2 hours and from 2 to 8 hours respectively.
The National Association of Doctors will strike in the whole country in alternation, the Union of Health and Social Employees (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will strike for two hours.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second demand is that the new method of calculating pensions, to be introduced from next year, be introduced in several stages.
The third demand is a guarantee, in terms of early retirement, that the jobs that deserve it can be transferred into the system before 2010.
The fourth ground of action is the rejection by the Free Union of Railroad Workers (VDSZSZ), affiliated to the League of Trade Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard has increased the risk to the country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, which was set up last August with the support of Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary), increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its  risk warning , the company points out that, in relation to the Hungarian Guard's activity, the biggest political risk is already that  in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes may occur as a result of the aggravation of the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary .
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is explained by one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors:  public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma issue to representatives of radical and extremist political groups who have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians .
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and aggressive conflicts are more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media has led to a significant deterioration of the image of Hungary abroad, in particular as regards confidence in the country's stability and democratic maturity.
They recall that, following increased publicity given to the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and extreme right groups since autumn 2006, numerous associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 under the name of  National Association for Self-Defense .
 The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civilian organization while publicly declaring the preparation of their members for defense missions (catastrophes, national defense, defence of order), armed if necessary, and also evoking the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state, they added.
They pointed out that everything was being done in a way that, based on the public's resentment of politics and parties, seeks to disguise different political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The emphasis on civil status and association status is therefore not only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in court but also to constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor which also increases the risk in relation to neighbourly relations.
 In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries have sought to justify their anti-Hungarian policies by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This is affecting the political stability of the region, they added.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The many Roma riots that broke out in a part of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) led to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the UNB decided to form a guard, saying that the organization's goal is  national self-defense .
They say that for the past 17 years, the Gypsies have terrorized Bulgaria but the state has remained inactive and neutral, reports Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had aroused a lively debate in the Bulgarian public.
As they say, the declaration by some Bulgarian Roma organizations about the formation of their own guard as a resistance signals the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The similarities in the functioning of the Hungarian Guard with the Bulgarian National Guard does not rule out that the Hungarian Roma may react to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defense, according to the risk warning of Political Capital.
When asked for information by the Telegraph Agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director at Political Capital, said: "Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur which could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party isn't marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly which holidays are to be observed, and around the holidays it has become common to reorganize the working days, the number of which will be reduced next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between national and state holidays and public holidays.
Holidays are often associated with religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, especially the last day so that the wake-up callers can rest peacefully.
In addition, in a year we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday commemorating the 1848 revolution, as is October 23 which is also the day of commemoration of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20th, we celebrate our state's constitution, May 1st is Labor Day, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our family members and friends who have passed away.
In addition, we have two days on Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since the days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize the working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the holiday marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years the Minister for Labour has been making a special regulation on the replacement of days before and after the holidays.
The law applies to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, which are non-stop and in service by virtue of their vocation, and also to holidays.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end of the year: from 24 December, life is almost stopped in the whole country because according to experience most people are working overtime or taking holidays they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays will fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganised for the first time around Labour Day to allow employees to stay home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day, with a rest day on Friday 2 May.
Another change is planned for 23 October: Saturday 18 October will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
But next year, the end of the year is marked by holidays, because from 24 December everyone will have a non-stop break, even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six trivial things that can terribly annoy coworkers
E-mails we forget to send, voice messages we never receive, innocent lies that almost annoy us more: these are things that  embellish  the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to the trouble or you take the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you, you got a call from the marketing department, says a colleague.
That you missed an appointment?
At best, he's sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department and telling them he forgot to pass the message (the least common solution).
In most cases, the matter is settled with an apology.
Before you give a hard explanation, it is good to think about how you might cause discomfort to your coworkers and to make an effort to avoid it.
You borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than trying to get a file or a desk tool or a phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk and it was gone the next morning?
You happen to find your pen that you thought you lost on your colleague's desk?
Do not take anything from your fellow workers without asking, or they will be right to be angry with you for taking their property.
Don't bring envelopes or post-it notes in your pocket, because it can be annoying if there aren't any left and you need them right away.
You're talking about the privacy of your coworkers?
There are no good ways to stop gossip from spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (assumptions) about the private life of your coworkers!
If a fellow confides his secrets to you, do not abuse his confidence.
Bury the information you shared with your colleagues in your heart and do not discuss it with them in their absence even if your colleagues also know about it.
You're calling in sick for no good reason?
When you call the office and you declare yourself ill on the pretext of a headache because you feel bad or you feel you need to rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your final assignments must be done by someone else for you.
Don't bother your coworkers!
If you know in advance that you will not be able to go to work the next day or that something may happen that will require you to stay at home, do not forget to inform your boss and your coworkers so that they will not be surprised that you are absent the next day.
Flirting, teasing, the phone
You're in your work, but the teasing of your coworkers is just a way to get you out of it?
Have you unwittingly witnessed a conversation on the phone that you would have preferred not to hear?
Do not disturb your coworkers with your whining, singing, talking out loud (over their heads), kicking, cursing, or expressing your displeasure aloud.
They can be annoying even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
You're blaming others for a mistake?
If your work is not done by the deadline, you forget to send an important e-mail or message, do not blame anyone for this forgetfulness!
Don't blame him for the possible chaos in the office or your noisy coworkers!
Confess your mistake and if it has caused others to be hurt, make amends.
Ask how you could fix your mistake, fix your negligence.
You feel too at home at the office?
Wearing jogging shoes is comfortable at home but not in the office!
Don't wear a comfortable jogging suit even if your job allows it!
Don't be neglected, show respect for your co-workers and yourself by dressing properly, and if your job requires it, wear nice, elegant clothes when you go to work!
If you want to live up to expectations, you're not interesting anymore.
We're moving slowly into the usual morning jam.
Suddenly, a special melody is played on the radio - the sound of a violin with electronic effects.
I'm going to turn it up.
The music changes rhythm and the bass comes along to accompany the tunes of the hour, then a chorus of women joins in like a real jewel.
Mr2 is playing the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian music life has not spoiled us for long with good quality electronic pop.
Now, I hear the cover gets different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground are gradually starting to change the overall picture and, despite the new fashion of guitar-tearing garage rock, Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the band of Yonderboi before he started on his own path, perhaps because there is no room for two feet in the same shoe.
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, were beginning to become known when he was entrusted with the composition of film soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török).
The band, which originally played in small clubs, was beginning to be known by a wider audience when the magazine wan2 named their 2002 debut album among the fifty most important records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, as the almost sole creators of the Hungarian trend that would be as competitive in the West.
Zagar and his ensemble have become undeniably trendy but no one asked them if they would wear that label.
The band reacted well, they released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, released recently, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent in Pécs.
It's that it was a line from the old Pécs group of Balázs Zságer.
We're good with the reference to flight but next to the air music now appears, following the spirit and trend of the time, the louder guitar, the impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs at the album's premiere at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, broadcasting since recently popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So, are you all right?
hvg.hu has asked questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new channel makes me ask a question: has your music remained a music for a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term "music" that is targeted to a certain gender doesn't mean much to me.
For me, there are two kinds of light music: not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop, but commercial music and sincere music.
So-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell it and thus become commercial.
But a good pop song can also be sincere.
The receptionist attitude also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is one more open to your music?
ZsB: In other countries, especially in the West, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts not only the young in their 10s and 20s but also the older ones.
They follow the changes in light music much more closely because they think it's also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people, listen to your music?
ZsB: I'm obviously happy to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we never made music for the market.
We don't make music to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts where mutual influence is already working but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you're trying to live up to the public's expectations, you're not going to be interesting.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow Yonderboi's example?
He works alone and made his career rather in the west.
ZsB: We don't really follow his path, although sometimes people try to find traces in our music.
We're more like team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it unfold.
At first, it was almost inevitable that our music would be compared to Yonderboi's because several of us would leave his band and go on another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love is in first place.
Many of us first heard the name Zagar through this song.
With this more popular style, you've consciously opened up to a wider layer?
ZsB: We didn't plan on making a hit to sell the record.
This song means more than that.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes that were addressed throughout the record.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did they - what was the guideline?
ZsB: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea to compose this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
The choir was composed of six members, including Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], and Juci Németh, who were later called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like this or did the girls change it a little?
ZsB: This song was already there for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought that there was still something missing in this song.
The chord sequence attracted the song's voice.
I sang the same melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and it was all terribly spontaneous.
I remember it was a big boost for me back then, but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and at the concert too it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There's no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a solo role, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than the music, so the music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were back on stage too.
Is that what you want?
ZsB: The fact that they were in the background is due to technical problems only.
But what was voluntary was that we didn't want to distribute solo roles.
The song also says that we have to forget our ego a little bit, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel the same euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
ZsB: Actually, no one in the process of creating music, we had more difficult songs when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I'm playing a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything just sort of came together like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite song from the new album?
ZsB: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already released this record.
Right now, they're Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The treacherous trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A fraud who hides his identity.
So calls his former employee the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
It seems rather that Kerviel is merely a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incompetent.
Unlike all the big banks, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's fragile", his superiors suggested, who reported him to the police.
However, according to Kerviel's testimony reported by French media, including Le Monde, his transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis extends beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank", he said in the deposition.
Last summer, he managed to profit from the American crisis to make half a billion euros.
In fact, he sensed the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
Reports began to emerge in February that so-called sub-prime mortgages, which are given to low-income customers or to those who have had problems in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in it and he bet it.
At the end of the year, the company's profits amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"As soon as I earned my first half a billion dollars, I didn't know how to announce it", Kerviel confides, adding that he, of course, kept nothing for himself".
During the interrogation, he admitted to falsifying the reports to avoid detection.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Whoever doesn 't risk anything has nothing .
Was he afraid of being discovered?
I'm not sure.
"I thought that just getting 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them".
Why is he willing to risk so much?
He only got to his post gradually.
He started working at Société Générale in 2000 right after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader, and in 2005, he became a freelance trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
But he knew he would never make as much as the others.
"From the first interview in 2005, I knew I was far less valued than others.
In view of my university education and my professional and personal background", Kerviel told investigators.
But soon after he took office, he won his first major victory.
Thanks to Allianz shares, he made half a billion euros betting on the fall of that stock in the London bombings.
And the mechanism was triggered -- he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you alone.
"It was like a snowball effect", he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"While I was winning, they pretended to close their eyes".
Then came the first of the year.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decides to hide the money.
When he gets to work on Monday, he's not a bank employee anymore.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost $5 billion because of him.
And how did we find out?
He's become suspicious because of his vacation.
"Last year I only took 4 days off.
A trader who does not take a holiday is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another", Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain EUR 365 billion in loans from the European Investment Bank.
Yesterday, Czech government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could bring 14 billion euros (about 365 billion Czech crowns) to the Czech Republic in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion crowns under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit the most, up to 150 billion.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will increase the budget of the National Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage a sum of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, which is aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, is to be used to obtain financial means to encourage innovation within enterprises.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to the Member States, and to the Member States.
The Czech Republic has been one of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members so far.
Court upholds 20-year prison sentence for former Nicaraguan president
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua on Thursday upheld the 20-year prison sentence of former president Arnold Alemán, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 million (nearly $1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released and placed under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether the former Central American leader, who was in office from 1997 to 2002, will be imprisoned again is not clear at this time, according to the AP news agency.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, it will all depend on the prison officials now, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or he will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved that Alemán regularly transferred government money to foreign corporate accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of that money went into funds that Alemán had set up to fund his 2001 election campaign.
We passed the budget.
That's the way it is.
The state budget has been passed.
What is so special about this budget?
This is the first budget drafted by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without the support of the opposition.
The vote for this year was passed a year ago with the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote on the motion of no confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The House of Representatives passed this law without any problems, which, although it is the most influential, is usually overlooked.
That's a paradox of sorts.
Whether we like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and the end of any government.
The budget is part of politics, but it is hidden behind the power struggle between the government and the opposition.
The latter is more attractive to the media and therefore receives more attention in the media.
The debates between politicians are far more interesting to the public than the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the previous socialist governments suffered from three problems which the present budget is unable to solve at once:
The first is the large share of the mandate expenses imposed by law, which consists not only of pensions but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, the result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, the biggest concern is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bonds in a stupor, putting their municipalities in excessive debt, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from money from taxes, levies and bank loans.
In previous years, they managed to repay these debts by selling off shares in the distribution systems, particularly in the energy sector, which they had obtained from the State as part of privatisations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
If we stick to the official and verifiable facts, we find that:
Our economy has already been in a growth phase for several years, as has the rest of the world, and ČSSD is not without its share of the surprise.
This was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were increasingly indebted to the State.
Other countries, with a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
This is a monstrous shame which has been felt by the previous governments.
We are among the countries that are least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
We do not need massive social programmes which have unfortunately become unnecessarily inflated in recent years.
Although we have succeeded in removing some of the absurd populist spending approved last year before the elections, if a shift in the retirement age and a reform of the pension system do not take place soon, then all politics will cease to exist in this country and whoever is in power will only administer.
It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats who will mechanically distribute the majority of the tax money between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the present budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only suspend the mechanism whereby ordinary expenses are replaced by term expenses.
The projected deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely useless if the previous governments had not spent all the money they could.
If we really do not want the politicians in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give the fragile coalition government, aware that the state can spend only the equivalent of what it can collect in taxes and duties, the necessary calm to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will make it possible to achieve a balanced state budget.
The following is a list of the names of the persons:
Banks want to solve the crisis
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, the European Central Bank and the central banks of England, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than $100 billion will be put into the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, by auction, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Federal Reserve will send $40 billion to the auction and will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of individual countries have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even mitigate the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend", writes Bernard Baumohl of the consultancy Economic Outlook Group in his client report.
"Consistent action by central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent", Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion in unpaid loans, mostly in the United States.
Analysts expect further losses in the billions.
"The reason central banks have chosen this approach is that they really need to be aware of what is yet to come", says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"I hear the situation is really bad", he adds.
Central banks fear that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after failing to lower the London interbank rate, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still wary of borrowing from each other, even though the US, Canadian and British central banks had cut their interest rates several times during the autumn.
"It will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates", Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the central banks' approach will help to avert the crisis, since it does not solve the main problem, which is the collapse of the housing market in the USA.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect developing countries most.
President Václav Klaus has once again spoken out on the issue of global warming.
The criticism this time was directed at the UN international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not Green, he said that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
Klaus said that it was not only the structure of the conference, which was made up of a curious mix of representatives from governments and non-governmental organizations, that was unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, replacing solutions to current problems", Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, during the presentation of his book, that his subject matter is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed satisfaction that his book was also published in German translation, since, he said, "I often meet only with caricatures of my opinions".
Now interested persons can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus said that although he was not a climate scientist, he felt he had enough motivation to write such a book.
He is an academic who can follow and appreciate scientific papers, he has a background in statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, in his view, the following: the climate is constantly changing, changes in it are therefore normal, there is no consensus among all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are neither too great nor too serious, so they pose no danger, and, finally, efforts to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Especially since he has had experience of a totalitarian regime, he considers it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous infringement on freedom.
In answer to questions from those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against a fundamentalist environmentalism which does not take into consideration the relationship between costs and profits".
Klaus had already spoken about this in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have failed to renew their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities will be able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without valid licenses will be on the road.
According to the authorities, the driving licence has not been renewed, especially for those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities report a drop in the number of applications for renewal of permits, the authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of applications for renewal of permits has been increasing this week.
The City Hall caters to about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a line of about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to get a new permit.
However, it is possible to apply for a release within a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays an additional five hundred crowns.
Drivers who fail to renew their driving licence by the end of the year and drive without a valid licence will face a fine from January.
The guilty party will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine is increased to 2500 crowns.
According to the old reports, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
This could have forced her to pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to exercise restraint and to impose fines not exceeding 1000 crowns.
According to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, no one is in danger of tens of thousands of fines.
He believed that a driver's license is a document that people can decide whether they want it or not.
It's not like the ID card, which has to be valid without exceptions.
People who no longer wish to drive should return their driving licence.
You can simply bring it or send it to the appropriate municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licence.
Persons with documents dating from 1994 to 2000 have three years to renew their documents.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
The court reduced the sentences of the detectives who had made a deal with Berdych.
Josef Opava and Petr Koňařík, former police officers accused of collusion with David Berdych's gang, will serve 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague High Court thus sentenced them to a final sentence, reducing their sentences by one and two years respectively.
The original penalty for detectives in the Department for Combating Organised Crime was 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Superior Court is envisaged.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting the verdict of the trial court.
However, he has already been sentenced in other trials to a total of more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Departmental Court found 19 people guilty of participating in robberies, and the Superior Court was now dealing with the interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants, from the beginning of the investigation, questioned the charge, claiming that it was a rigged case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the police, after an agreement with Berdych, among other things, passed on information from police sources to the criminals, covered up the various robberies and helped the gang members to avoid criminal liability.
The gang paid Opava and Koňařík 30 percent of the theft.
The indictment alleges the gang's criminal activity between 1999 and 2001.
The main cases were armed robberies, in most cases resulting in serious harm to the health of the victims, but also the abuse of power by a public official and the prohibited use of weapons.
During house searches, the police have found illegally held pistols, steel-core shells, laser-guided sights or machine guns.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a whole series of others guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych neighbourhood are still standing in court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has, for the time being, avoided Tomáš Půta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting the final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The cost of child substitution: 12 million
The lawyer for the families of the victims, Igor Veleba, wants to obtain from the Třebíč hospital a compensation of 12 million crowns plus expenses.
Three million for each of the mothers, two million for the fathers and one million for each of the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the hospital's lawyer Ondřej Dostál is absolutely against Veleba's proposal.
"We reject such a claim, it is very, very high", Dostál said at the exit of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party has commissioned.
We'll see if this one has any explanatory value.
But we still think that the total should not exceed hundreds of thousands", Dostál stressed.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between Kč 100,000 and Kč 200,000 for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloňov's family demanded one million crowns for every month that she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, drawn up for it by the University Hospital Centre in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, the parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with remorse for not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, are less calm about the trauma they have experienced in the news and about what is happening precisely at this moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the Třebíč hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jablovov.
The governor of the Vysočina Region, Miloš Vystrčil, gave each of the families 100,000 crowns at the end of October to reimburse the costs of the error at the Třebíč hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are required by law to have civil liability insurance.
In the event of a failure, they must draw on the reserve fund, and in exceptional cases they may ask the manager for help.
Until now, the compensation awarded by the courts has been relatively small, with the amounts calculated from the tables in the hundreds of thousands, and exceptionally in the millions.
Polívka has lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the case concerning the trade mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, he was indeed the one who first used the title King of Valašsko, but the project was put together by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the actor's former collaborator.
Polívka wasn't at the hearing today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitic on the popularity of Bolek Polívka", said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko remind everyone of this actor and comedian.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
"It's about finding money and setting events", he said.
He thinks it's the money that's causing the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and that they could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work", he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka was the first to use the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in his TV show.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
But at that time, it was not about setting up a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came up with the idea of issuing Valašské Království passports.
From a humorous action it turned into a business and a lucrative commercial activity, followed by the creation by Harabiš of the Valašské království company.
In 1997 Polívka agreed to have his name and signature on the passport and even offered to pay the holders for the price of a visit to his farm and for his theatrical performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the nude idea, published by Polívka in the show manéž, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project", the judge said.
However, it added that the heart of the project was Harabiš and his team, who were intensely involved in the project.
The collaboration between the now-enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to build up between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition of "King Boleslav I, elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by the singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabiš and his company, a request that the court has now rejected.
What might clear the matter up is the tournament being considered for the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
He didn't want to give away the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to rush into work.
It would be something like the parade of kings in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register", added Harabiš.
Testing the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: the end of prejudice
To tell you the truth, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its handling qualities were not extraordinary, the quality of the gear change, the handling and also the manufacturing could in many respects be described as below average.
The Peugeot 207 is now on the market, and it is much better.
Especially since the combi called SW goes one step further, I have only to think about it.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained about the headroom in the rear seats.
And that's all the complaining about, because the bodywork combined means that even the great devils will be comfortable in this regard.
Let's see what we can do.
I'll go into the interior very quickly so I don't repeat myself too much.
It is a fairly successful design, my only comment being that the central tunnel is poor.
I would have liked a more inventive design, given the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the days when you could complain about seats or files being too short are over.
The lateral guidance has also been significantly improved compared to the model 206.
As for the space, the increase in body dimensions is also noticeable here.
The combi also eliminates the lack of space above the head mentioned earlier.
A box in the box
So the most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I must rate this one as very accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and rather easy to secure.
The blinds are fitted with elastic stoppers which are an ideal compromise.
It is lightweight and can be stretched while being able to hold quite heavy objects.
But let's just stop at the volume.
The table shows that the basic configuration is 428 litres, which is a rather average figure compared to the competition.
Except for the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product of Mlada Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains very noticeably behind, the difference being 52 litres.
When it comes to going on holiday abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to point out the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the car remaining after the reversing of the rear seat backs perfectly straight, or a very low footrest.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested had a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 litres and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like when it's running a family hatchback.
It's quiet, it consumes little, and, most importantly, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having a hose-clogged exhaust, then I can only be enthusiastic.
Let's go through the rates.
The price of the vehicle is not affordable for everyone.
However, it should be borne in mind that we tested a car with a fairly well-equipped interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1.4-litre Otto engine, amounting to Kč 329 900, is still acceptable.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is enough.
The premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80 000 CZK.
We also have head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic control of the rear windows...
In reality, the vehicle costs at the end of the day Kč 531 900.
That's a lot, but try adding the extra equipment to the price of the Fabia and you get a very similar figure.
So all that's left is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not going well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, which causes the remainder to be concerned about the evolution of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a series of obstacles.
British schools are even seeing cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn violent.
The case of northern Kent, where the conflict between the Slovak immigrants and the residents is beginning to intensify, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, the bullying and the fighting among the students have translated into the relationships between the parents.
The situation got so bad that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a rod.
The defendant claims that the boy insulted her with racist remarks.
Police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"As we were driving home, a young man climbed onto the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he responded with apples and pears and then he uncovered his buttocks", described another unpleasant experience by a mother of Slovak schoolchildren.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the residents went so far as to describe the conflicts with the immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show that the atmosphere in British schools between the natives and the immigrants is beginning to become tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who came to Britain to find work are registered in Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's truly an island of freedom.
Everything you want from your vacation can be achieved if you make the right choice.
Gold-white beaches, high waves, or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm trees and all-inclusive with waiters offering you pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will find not only the full list but a rich one.
But there is only one island where you can find much more, and that is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Greater Antilles.
In the days of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place that the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the depository and transshipment point for the treasure that the Spaniards had stolen and carried to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mafia, had it built, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was allowed and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
I mean, you know, Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,
In Havana, high-rise buildings were built and cars, which were the iconic symbols of the 1950's, were parked on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America were signing their names on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can sign your own autograph on the walls of the Bodeguita in Havana.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be served a cocktail of your choice.
And these iconic cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and the formerly imported windmills have long since, in such a salty and humid climate, rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity are there so many splendid colonial monuments as there are there.
Other places are getting more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings in the money that is needed, its development has the green light.
During the last 15 years, new hotels have sprung up not only in Havana but especially in Varader, on the coast of the province of Holguín, and also on the smaller islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by lovers of small trains.
The cane was brought back from the sprawling sugar plantations by small steam-powered trains on a narrow track.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and so one can see small locomotives in operation, the contemporaries of which are only in museums.
Where to direct his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most famous places.
So there is no need to write long about Varadero or Havana.
Also, there is a museum on the aforementioned Hemingway estate, and anyone who loves this writer should not miss the visit.
The Viňales Valley in the west of the island is one of the most picturesque corners of Cuba.
There, lush vegetation grows on calcareous soil.
Mud flaps, limestone balloons, and rocks rise from the valley floor, and the fertile soil has taken hold in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a dense vegetation.
The valley is probably the place where the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see the final shape of this product if you visit one of the cigar factories in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that this is where the Chilean episode of Major Zeman was filmed.
The Trinidad
Ancient city founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought him fame and wealth.
The wealth was embodied in the beauty and the show-town character of this small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, which was greatly influenced by the later French colonial architecture, has remained almost unchanged for four years.
Located between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, Trinidad is so isolated that until the 1950's there was no road connecting the region to the rest of the country.
This isolation has allowed him to stay out of the way.
We didn't build anything, so we didn't demolish anything, but everyone was content with a roof over their head.
If you have more than an afternoon in Trinidad, it is also worthwhile to visit interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón or the Valley of the Sugar Pigs.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after sunset and where the music is heard only in the early morning.
Other
Some call this village in the far east of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path leading to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must pass through high, rugged mountains and through a landscape almost devoid of any trace of human activity.
The UNESCO has included the eastern part of Cuba, thanks to its unspoiled landscape, on the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made there, in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was made about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where the old castle and the present hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain range, the Bay of Pines and Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of Cuba's patron saint Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practiced by the descendants of former slaves - all of these could fill a lot of pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, the Allies are passive, the Americans say
The lack of troops and equipment is affecting the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years ahead.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, by the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight states involved are also discussing future plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Defence Secretary Robert Gates, this week called for NATO troops to be more active, Britain sees strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development aid as a priority.
"The developments in Afghanistan are noticeable, but military might can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new economic and security development themselves", British Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The U.S. military has recorded the most intense activity by Afghan insurgents in the past five years.
The number of violent acts has increased by 27 percent compared to last year, to 60 percent in Helmand Province, in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the southern part.
The United States, however, maintained that the Allies had reached their absolute limit both in the organization and equipment of their troops.
In particular, they are asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as the ways in which we can achieve them", Gates said.
The Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop, made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's not enough", De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there has also been conflict between the countries involved over whether all the allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate", Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan slackers discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight", Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counterattacked by publishing a photo of a British troop at a rugby match in the southern part of Afghanistan.
Government debt to reach one trillion in 2009
Each Czech is burdened with a government debt of more than 84,000 crowns.
The total debt stood at 842.7 billion crowns at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year.
As a result of a better than expected development of the state budget savings, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion crowns.
The Czech Republic's public debt rose to DKK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the first nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, as of June, it had fallen by 13.4 billion kroner.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the government debt from the beginning of October.
The burden of a debt of more than 84,000 crowns is on each Czech.
During the whole of last year, the State borrowed more than 111 billion kroner.
"At the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, the one trillion crown mark could be exceeded in 2009 alone.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns", said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The forecast of Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor is similar: "We could exceed one trillion by the end of 2009.
The exact date will depend on the next budget which we do not know yet.
If it appears that the political situation is changing, that politicians are ready to save more, the date could be pushed back to 2010.
But I don't expect that change", he said.
Debts are increasing
The state debt is made up of the central government's debts and is mainly caused by the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by treasury bills, annuities, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The internal debt of the State has increased this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The external debt of the State has increased this year from 1,7 billion crowns to 123,3 billion crowns.
The marketable state debt reached 803.3 billion crowns at the end of September and decreased by 13.7 billion crowns from June.
The average maturity of the government debt was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased year-on-year from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which is far too high a figure given the current health of the economy.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated by annuity securities where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be negotiating material when the pension reform comes", commented Pikora.
Better than we expected.
It follows from the strategy for financing and managing the state debt for 2007 that the government had planned to borrow 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of September, however, the Ministry reduced the planned amount to 152.8 billion kroner, as the state budget was more cost-effective than expected.
The sum is mainly the deficit in the State budget, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year, instead of the 91.3 billion crowns originally planned.
The second is the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely DKK 13.3 billion, the DKK 10 billion pension reserve, DKK 43 billion for the financing of state pension securities and DKK 1.8 billion for the repayment of European Investment Bank loans.
She's standing before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of allowing six- to seven-year-old students to name a teddy bear after Muhammad, when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was liable to a whip sentence.
The 54-year-old British teacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and sedition under Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asked her students, ages six and seven, to choose a name for the teddy bear in the classroom.
"Eight names came out of the children's mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed", says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Muhammad is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but it's a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the caption My name is Mohamed.
The bear itself did not carry any label with that name, but the problem is simply that the depiction of the prophet is considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said he knew her well and that she would never do anything that would be insulting to a religious faith, I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name, he just thinks it was an innocent mistake.
This view is shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as very caring for her students and never talking about religion in class.
It is also the second most common name in Britain, spelled 14 different ways in English.
This name is often chosen by Muslim families as a way to honor the prophet (often given to the firstborn child of a family).
But what are the rules about using that first name?
Can you give it to a toy?
This is of course a matter of interpretation.
They failed to reach agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna on Wednesday.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo concluded a sixth and final session of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, unable to overcome their differences over the future status of the breakaway province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status", European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
Underlining that peace in the region was "at stake", his US counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the immediate future but we are entering a very difficult period", he added, noting that "evident tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will make their last visit to Serbia and Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, which is 90% Albanian, may become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was given a new mandate by the UN in August.
The US and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo at the Security Council, insist on continuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Kharchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, the West believes that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina has said it is ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached", said the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden hotel where the last-chance negotiations had been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade was "a part of the past that led to murders and deportations".
 The domino effect
Serbian President Boris Tadic said a compromise was still possible, warning Kosovo's Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence for the province.
Belgrade says it fears a domino effect in a region still fragile as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
'For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be made exclusively by the Security Council, where its ally Russia has veto power.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia", said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they began: at the Security Council.
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that the Kosovo parliament would have the final say on the status of Kosovo, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking people would be done in consultation with the West.
Bush pulls a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced at the opening of the international peace conference he convened in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with a view to finding a final settlement to the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both sides of their obligations under the "road map" for peace they agreed to in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority headed by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues".
This designation covers the three thorny issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees driven from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and in-depth" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Olmert, in turn, pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort would be made to conclude them in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the deadline for the implementation of his "vision of two states" for Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it had obtained a commitment to this effect from Bush before deciding to attend the conference.
The Arab countries, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, were behind a plan, endorsed by all the Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all the Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it addresses the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in an interview with the Saudi Arabian daily.
The prosecutor's office is not responsible for the police.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in all cases of this kind, the official versions and rumors are contradictory.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation by the Inspector General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on the rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
She was not in intervention but on patrol, and was traveling at 40-50 km/h, without a gyrophar, a police source explains.
A green Kawazaki motorcycle, not approved, therefore not allowed to drive on public roads (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was travelling at a very fast pace.
"She hit the police car on her left, after being denied priority on the right", said a police officer.
Blood alcohol testing of the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (front broken, windscreen starred, bumper removed) indicates the severity of the impact.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation into "facts of involuntary manslaughter and failure to assist anyone in danger" to the IGPN, in liaison with the departmental directorate of public security of the Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, excluded the police from responsibility.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses to the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the police's version, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left.
Yesterday, a sort of groove, probably caused by the friction of the feet on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subjected to a technical examination.
Both victims' bodies were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly spread in Villiers-le-Bel that the police would have left the scene very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out any serious misconduct on this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigations, which we need to be very careful about", a police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness in the moments following the accident.
One of its windows looking precisely at the stage.
"We went down immediately with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital to try to revive them", said the witness.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a police officer, completely disgusted, limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the youngsters, the fourth was talking on the phone.
In view of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty of those present in the unexpected situation of the young people, the police were driven by their colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue team arrived about 20 minutes after the police left.
They also performed heart massages, but to no avail.
I will not let it be said that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people were rescued.
The fire department got here right away.
Everything was done to try to save them, the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first protests since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by the police, according to witnesses.
The latter retaliated by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers shot and wounded lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, lawyers from the Supreme Court Bar have called for a general strike and announced protests, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opposition, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the rally.
Other protests were reportedly held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The movement of lawyers on Monday gathered the support of the religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president 'exhorted the population to send flowers to the judges who voted against the state of emergency and garbage to those who swore before Musharraf'.
'Musharraf's promise is no longer true'
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
It was due to rule in the coming days on the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf by indirect vote on 6 October.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
'Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings,' the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president 'has not been kept' after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform by November 15, the end of his first term as president.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf was under house arrest by his deputy army chief.
More than one third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is unplanned, reveals a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (INED), 40 years after the Neuwirth law was passed that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unexpected births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5 to 6%, according to INED.
The liberalisation of contraception has nevertheless led to better "control of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has fallen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
And eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or they can be calculated monthly for about one in five couples, and preferably in spring, which is considered the most pleasant season to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his fellow crew members on the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential to the continuation of the station's scientific activities.
A risky launch that has accumulated records for its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, the tools  handcrafted  by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem emerged on Tuesday when astronauts unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery space shuttle, a large cylindrical piece that will soon be used by European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for the laboratory modules.
But we need to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move a 17.5 ton solar power module already on board the ISS to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began redeploying the module's solar panels, which have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfolds like accordions, was damaged by a cable that got stuck for about a meter.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally supposed to do a check-out of the shuttle Discovery and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotating system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go and wrap the 30-meter-long remote control arm of the shuttle attached to the station to perform the repair.
He's one of the best spacewalkers at NASA.
He's tall, tough, very skillful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor was assigned to operate the damaged solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he cut the faulty cable and installed some sort of splints on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini hockey stick wrapped in insulation to prevent electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and  handcrafted  by the astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before taking an inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts return to the shuttle Discovery for a scheduled return to Earth on Wednesday.
The EADS securities are listed on the stock exchange
EADS shares are currently in sharp decline on the Paris stock exchange, after the aerospace and defence group announced that it would have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to deal with delays in the A400M.
EADS is losing 4% at 21.96 euros at the moment on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to revise its forecast for operating profit for 2007 following delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditioned the aircraft's maiden flight.
The cost of the delay in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is 'between €1.2 and €1.4 billion, of which more than €1 billion is for Airbus', said the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be forced to announce new EBIT targets for 2007 when it presents its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without further figures.
The group also states that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another programme, the very large A380.
Initially, the group planned to deliver the first A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense at the polls on Sunday: Russians will vote massively for President Putin's party, United Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very tight campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today addressed voters a televised message on public television channels, which has already been recorded but the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so as the leader of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which is poised for a landslide victory.
Yesterday, the president made no mention of this when he received the foreign ambassadors, content with re-charging the West for interference - his favorite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and we want fair, transparent and open elections, free of any bribes", he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from a hit.
She denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziuganov says there have never been such dirty elections, even in Yeltsin's time.
After the crackdown on the protests last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
 The Russians have kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus 
The Commission has also been asked to examine the situation in the Member States.
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in the legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
 Russians have retained the homo sovieticus mentality, they do not feel in control of their destiny , says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes further: Civil society has lagged behind in this country five centuries after Europe became Christianized; the well-known community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin has returned to the paternalistic model of the state, which is perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism has not been followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians are willingly renouncing the personal responsibility they had briefly shown after the collapse of the USSR.
What's the point of thinking?
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of the United Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The public's preference is for stability.
Which is why the Russians won't vote for the extremists either.
The conclusion of Professor Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54 years old:  What is the use of thinking?
Those in power aren't too bad, why change them?
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of secrecy, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of line in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were previously only available for a humanitarian purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his or her beneficiaries.
The 11 states responsible for managing them - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to conduct research  on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health of forced labourers , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the opening of these nominative documents to the public, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The Gestapo's concentration camp records or arrest warrants were compiled after the war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or forced to work and, if necessary, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for compensation.
Today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen are still processing tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest to some in the scientific community.
 There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents , said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for Research on Anti-Semitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India aim for a free trade agreement in 2008
The current bilateral trade between India and Europe is already worth nearly 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
The EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission last April to start negotiations with a view to signing free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's ninth largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact would greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans", Peter Mandelson argued.
Europe is the first or second largest market for each of India's top ten exports, the European Commissioner said. The Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, lamenting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential".

The Bank of England is responding to concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday it was keen to ease the current backlash over credit conditions and announced an unusual five-week offer of £10 billion at a base rate of 5.75%.
"To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will structure their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve supply during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December as a five-week open market operation", the Bank said in a statement.
The bank said that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be put on the market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT, at the base rate, and until 10 January.
This is the first time the BoE has put five-week liquidity on the open market.
These are normally done within a week.
The BoE added in its statement that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of day-to-day interbank lending in line with its base rate.
The interbank overnight rate was 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month rate stood at 6.6%, the highest since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the money marketed by the Bank of England has been subject to a high penalty rate which has deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumors, corroborated by the change in the value of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the money put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more favourable rates and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
The text, which was drafted in a socialist "niche" (a session initiated by a parliamentary group), contained a dozen measures adopted by the PS national bureau on Tuesday, including a 50% increase in the employment premium, the reinstatement of the floating TIPP, a transport check or the regulation of rents.
The meeting was called after the general debate, which resulted in a sometimes lively debate between the majority and the opposition, a few hours after Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
The leader of the PS Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his group will present all of its proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill to be considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is born
Following numerous rumors about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the promoter/producer is announcing the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with Festival Republic by British producer Melvin Benn.
"It's an honor for our company to work with someone who has inspired the festival movement in America today", C3's Charlie Jones told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic's director, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989 he took over the reins of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organisational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500.
Calling Glastonbury the 'most inspiring event' he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and were working diligently with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia", argues Charlie Jones.
We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we have been caught up in political trickery by the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
Fortunately, we've had a chance to talk to Melvin Benn and we're about to create a great festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.
C3 Presents revived the 2005 Lollapalooza festival at Chicago's Grant Park, after having made a name for itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are held in urban green spaces", says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge the two formulas in some way to give the impression of a European country festival and an American urban festival.
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, is very supportive of the event", says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says that they are sufficiently interesting to allow investing in such an event and hosting a festival that, hopefully, will have a long life.
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very large", like the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were sent to the groups, but nothing could be confirmed at the time of going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavored, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all kinds of audiences", says Charlie Jones.
His partners on C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when no one but Terminator is opposed...
This mission of seduction is part of the delegate's duties.
A term - politically difficult because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the runaway productions.
Is it hard to play in the Governor's shoes?
You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she thinks the conditions in Montreal are favorable, she'll go.
Our role is to offer what they will consider to be the best, he said.
The Race to the Festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of local cinema.
The Oscars are on.
It will be the theme of all festivals on the West Coast, whether it's Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present Quebec films, showcase them and make sure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Ages had a great showing at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is showing in Santa Monica and will be shown at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
The experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
With less than five weeks to go, investors are already scrambling to get their hands on the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so sure that this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in the stock market generally has a positive behaviour.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, as uncertainties lie in wait on the markets, at least in the short term, given the current context.'
Although they are not in favour of a stock market boom in the last weeks of the year, they note that "the stock market is being fed by the liquidity available, which is willing to invest given the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, which is affected by the effect of the flight to quality securities in both the long and short term".
They believe that the stock market will behave rather sideways, not free of volatility, "especially because the impact of the likely Fed rate cut is unknown, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing", the expert assures.
The Spanish stock market index, the Ibex, has lost almost 4% since November 8th, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganization of portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert assures that things will be a bit different this year as he believes the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the Constitution Day bridge (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said that we were close to technical levels and "therefore we could see a rebound in the index which could be triggered by information coming from the European Union on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree to choose the values that will be responsible for driving the Ibex to new maximum quotes.
Solana of Intermoney says that "this year the big values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two big banks and a few manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco said the bank and industrial sector would be responsible for the increases.
The women constructors will also benefit from this rally, should they decide to participate.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other manufacturers such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path", the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be a major factor in the latter part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do just as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month only twice.
The real year-end rally was in 2003, when the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the bursting of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It remains to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of gains (for the moment the Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to compete on its year-end rally.
The People's Bank will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The People's Bank has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the brand name Populaire Max, represent a major change for the bank.
The rest of the Spanish agencies are also concerned, since it is the first group to decide to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its branches until 8.30 p.m. and to open on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 8.30 p.m.
Another group, BBVA, has also repeatedly stated that it would like to expand the hours of its branches, although it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He's about to make a deal with the unions to close 75 percent of his offices on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the People's Bank will be decisive for whether other organizations join or not this initiative which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely the aim of the People's Bank.
Attract self-employed customers who travel in these areas to shop at the SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank intends to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, since this is not the opening of new branches but a renovation of existing ones.
To this end, the organisation will modernise the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on the different streets.
The extension of the hours is accompanied by a different design of the interior of the branch and a new, more contemporary design with brighter colours.
The bank's sales manager, Ángel Rivera, assures us that this renovation will not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience was positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets that have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The People's Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others that operate under the brand of Mundocredit, which specializes in immigration cases, also with very large hours, which open even on Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax branches they will not copy the BBVA model, where several of its branches have a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
For now, they've reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco for the first time doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've made it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a chief executive of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction yesterday, at the close of the stock market, when he found that the channel he runs was twice the value of its rival, Antena 3.
The only thing that made him unhappy was that 'I am not saddened by the fact that we have increased more but by the fact that we have decreased less.'
However, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54 percent gain.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66% for the year.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (up 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which lost 1.52% yesterday and has been down 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in that of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in that of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.'
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television channel to surpass the 1 billion gross advertising revenue this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, the chief executive of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
In order to make this announcement true, the TV channel should record a 3.6% increase in its advertising bills for the current financial year compared to 965,4 million in the financial year 2006.
Net revenues from Antenne 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to 734.4 million) while net revenues from television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to as the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the large pay-out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that, although it is too early to make a decision, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given equity with the 33% of Endemol.'
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimated earnings on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in the projected growth of incomes from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the forecast of Antenne 3's profits to 4,5 % in 2008 and to 7,5 % in 2009.
3 opinions
1. What?
Ibersecurities recommends buying both securities based mainly on their high dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
2. What is it?
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco (accumulate) as better than Antenne 3 (maintain) for the 'multiple attractions' and the increase in business.
3. What is it?
JPMorgan: he recommends that both cases be examined as he has had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a bad economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation which will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the effort made by the Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activity of bodies so that markets can function effectively.
Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, implies the modernisation of financial markets, at the same time as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the heads of the National Securities Market Commission (NSMC) and promotes cooperation between the various heads of the European Union.
The new rules will allow financial advisory services to be provided for specialised social reasons as well as to natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial advisory firms (FAs), which combine securities firms, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions in financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and international order systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment firms to disclose information on the market about key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they carry out, to facilitate the monitoring by the NCA.
The Committee on Economic Affairs of the Congress has made several amendments, one of which is that securitised debt will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high investor risk, as has been demonstrated by what happened with the high risk (subprime) US mortgage debt.
In addition, they have taken advantage of the transposition of management has taken advantage to legally delimit the functions that graduates in Economics can have 30 years after in 1977, was approved, the Royal Decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists.
The Senate, for its part, has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the Ombudsman, who will work for an undertaking, who will not need the authorisation of the CNMV and who will be able to offer his services of marketing products and attracting new clients to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index rises by five tenths in November to 4.1%.
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance of price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication is in line with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same method as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE pointed out that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the final data to be revealed on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
Second Vice-President and Minister for the Economy Pedro Solbes said the 4.1 per cent increase in the CPI in November was a "time figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index would continue at "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes said in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good", Spain's inflation differential on the subject of monetary union remains "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there were fewer surprises" than in the previous month, when the Government was not faced with such a high increase.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4 per cent", the Minister of Economy acknowledged in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to raise $42 billion over three years with Northern Rock
Northern Rock's deposits have fallen by more than 50% to £12 billion since it entered into a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to a rescue loan from the Bank of England.
At that time he had amassed some record deposits of over £25 billion, a figure which has been gradually falling over the past two and a half months due to the distrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of this money offered by the Government that he will hold it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rename the organisation with its financial trading brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the UK banks' income that will be deposited over the next three years to secure the remaining £18 billion until it reaches its £30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known for its loud advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin Association's bid, which includes three other companies, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
Totana Mayor arrested for alleged urban corruption scheme
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of Totana (Morsi) (of the Popular Party) early this morning because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot discovered this week.
AIn addition, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the municipal police chief were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the I of May last year Juan Morales, current right-wing MP, and until then municipal councillor of the city hall, and who according to the sources of the survey consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'manager' of this plot.
Officers are still searching city hall and city council buildings and we're not ruling out the possibility of further arrests in the next few hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the urban corruption plot, uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As the SER channel told the lawyer of the 'people's party' MP Juan Morales yesterday, he was arrested as he left Morales' home with important documentation in his possession related to the plot.
Moreover, according to sources in the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of fees from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight people in custody.
Bono agrees to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's bid for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the election
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be at the head of the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
The Spanish Socialist Party's organising secretary, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting with Zapatero at the party's headquarters this afternoon.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also stressed that "yes it seems" that the Chanel politician will be the candidate of the Socialist group to chair the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as Congress president, who on 15 November made public his decision not to run in the next general election and to abandon his political career to devote himself to the fight against climate change in the academic environment.
The former minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister has been insisting on his return to the political vanguard ever since he left him two years ago.
He also noted that although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce who will chair the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he succeeds, Bono hopes to turn the House into "a house of respect, not of insult or screaming" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems unfortunately that the only place in Madrid where one cannot talk quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on certain occasions has been interrupted 26 times".
Similarly, he has had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "skill" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in office so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
A climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjecting to relentless persecution both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prioritize other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more so for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges it to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has contributed decisively to Spain's leading the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-performance, in which sectors it occurred and why his government, the one of the contract with the planet, did not prevent it.
In addition, it must clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will we have to make, what economic consequences will this have.
That is, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been and will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrifice and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
They are costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even the hundredth part of the fuel suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that he was quick to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans that have no real consequence.
With sentences that have an impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns who does not speak, who does not denounce and who does not demand, beautifies the meetings and inspires tenderness.
I hope that this is limited to a purely virtual contracting party and that it does not pretend that we are going around on bicycles or cooling off with the fan.
Totana Mayor and Local Police Chief Arrested for Alleged Urban Corruption Plot
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, sources from the investigation informed today.
The city councillor was arrested at his home and taken to the town hall, where many officials were now meeting, who also presented themselves to the Municipal Planning Councillor and the municipal company for the management of industrial land and housing.
These three decisions are in addition to the six decisions made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation to requalify more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land for urbanisation so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after paying illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Court No. 1 of Totana is investigating.
The first six detainees were sentenced today.
According to the sources, the former Totana city councillor and currently an autonomous parliamentarian of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the target of the investigation.
In addition, the former wife, owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo (Galicia), was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, the agency of the Nuaria Group through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is being carried out by the Urban Crime Unit of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were in companies linked to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
So only one person was arrested in Totana, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the area, who may have been the intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcia municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 dwellings, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been reclassified and its project is expected to double the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate development; Conycase, which manages Vigo's car parks in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and in the Plaza de Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.
Things that happen
1. What?
If they're willing, we'll leave the Book of the Month alone, see if we can come up with any other ideas in the meantime.
I'm already thinking of something.
Life is change.
Of course, you are welcome to propose inventions.
2. What is it?
Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's commentary in Finland's most important newspaper (and certainly the world's top PISA news outlet), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the same day that Blackburn's book review was published there, curiously:
"The content of the Philosophy course has been challenging public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit, a bachelor's student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
The Education Councillor for Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers adopt a critical attitude toward Plato on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he asserted that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools".
3. What is it?
A colleague is passing on information about the introduction of Internet downloading offences into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a felony punishable by six months to a year in prison.
However, theft from a CD store for less than 400 euros is considered only as a misdemeanour (Article 623.1).
B. Shoplifting of up to €1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than for downloading (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty for downloading (section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to be involved in a fight than to be involved in the trafficking of CDs.
Taking part in a violent fight carries a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs carries a sentence of six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to section 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. Distribution of copyright protected films without authorization of the authors is punished more severely than distribution of pornographic material to minors (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the right, then someone is overreacting.
4. What?
My doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled 'Money activates the brain, especially if others are getting less.'
That is to say, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using magnetic resonance tomography at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognitive imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute, Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
The researchers observed that when both people guessed that they were getting the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one of them got double the pay, the activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required that much science.
The prosecutor of the Balkans
For eight years Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly prosecuting war criminals in the Balkans from the prosecutor's office of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is based in The Hague.
Her term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died - former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on this list, which the documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title from, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not exclusively screened in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York who pursues fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of a potential accident, involves a considerable expense, which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving license, marital status, type of vehicle to insure or use, and so on.
Having a car is the main thing.
The problem is that choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the right car model.
And the fact is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is embodied in an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a loss.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is determined by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies base their prices on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the payout.
This is why people over 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, from surveys, companies have concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the likelihood, of accidents.
Increasing the frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables which insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
This is why the driver must carefully consider the situation in order to choose the car insurance that best suits his profile.
Here we will consider the most important variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it not only adapts to the characteristics of the insurer but also offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 face various disadvantages when contracting affordable insurance, such as low driving experience and a long driving licence.
Although the ideal way to be well insured is to take out a full-risk insurance policy, there are other, more economical options.
The most prudent drivers can opt for all-risk insurance with a deduction, so that they get all-risk insurance coverage at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the damage that the customer pays will be determined by the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount", says Luis Noguera, the Spanish manager of First Europa, an online insurance broker.
Another option is extended third party insurance, so that the customer provides protection for damage caused to third parties, but for damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
I'll give you a tip.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of the insurance in the future.
A rebate is a reduction in the basic fare that the company has.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
'The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year, it can afford to increase the bonuses", explains Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers to sign an insurance contract, since the rate of accidents is reduced by the experience gained.
For this reason it is best to choose a full-risk insurance policy with honesty.
"Young people usually do not get the benefit of the experience they have after an accident", says the European company's director in Spain, adding that most accidents occur during the second year of driving, after the 'first-time driver's fear' has passed.
However, if the customer is married but has no children, it is preferable that he negotiate a full-risk insurance policy, as long as his financial situation allows it.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the ones with the lowest claims rate, because the premiums will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be an all-risk insurance with deduction (which can be 300 euros), or an extended third party insurance from the third year of the vehicle's life when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed lifestyle and a greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchisees", says Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, all-risk insurance with deduction is preferable (this being EUR 150), or extended third party insurance where the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of a potential accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, so it is essential to study properly which insurance is most suitable for us according to our personal situation.
Celtic will be looking to win a point in Milan to reach the last eight.
AC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will face each other next Tuesday at the San Siro in search of the missing point to reach their respective goals in the closing of the Champions League, as it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to qualify.
The Italians have ten points and they have already qualified on day five thanks to a draw in Portugal, while Celtic Glasgow have nine points, but they still need another point to make sure Shakhtar Donetsk, who have six, and who receive Benfica, who have four, do not pass them.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as AC Milan are due to play the semi-finals of the Club World Cup in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place in the final on 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at Giuseppe Meazza Stadium seems to be the most expected result, although both teams will try to come out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow know that by winning they would remain first and ensure a better crossing in the quarter-finals.
A defeat by Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to qualify if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but they can't rely on that alone as with nine points the game is up to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
The Milanese will try to poison the evening for the Scots, who are hoping to qualify for the Champions League second time in a row, after being beaten in the last edition by a goal by Kaka during extra time (1-0).
Until the 'rossoneri' win, the triumph would only go to Shakhtar, in case Celtic lost, to qualify for the eighth-finals to continue the UEFA Champions League.
And that is that Benfica, although they are last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach the third place with a win.
20,000 people in Vancouver for the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
The Spice Girls kicked off their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, to an audience of about 20,000 people since the group disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before they started their gig at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the reunion of the band was "brilliant".
About 20,000 sold out tickets to the concert, which featured a video telling the story of the band that was a sensation in the late 1990's.
The reunion and world tour coincided with the release of a new album that features their main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI released in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls took to the stage to show off the bracelets that were given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd that filled GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him to do so a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham remarked that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about the show".
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "because of differences between us" and caused the band to disband two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press two hours before the show started.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings had changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision", Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much".
But a lot has changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines flight.
When they arrived at the airport, an army of babysitters was waiting for them.
She had five sons and seven daughters.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid, they will be exhibited on 23 December.
The new gas deal between Russia and Ukraine is setting the alarm.
A dispute over gas prices is heating up between Ukraine and Russia, increasing the risk of repercussions on fuel exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported through pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev has announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, a dispute between the two caused a reduction in supplies to the EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Russia's gas-supplier Gazprom tried, unsuccessfully, to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom has stated that it will increase its prices to Ukraine as planned, as it has agreed to pay for 2008 up to 50% more for gas supplies from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would mean a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom for Ukraine.
 It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gas is transit, said Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinkh to Reuters news agency.
 The fluctuations in gas costs are probably related to our discussions on transit charges (to Western Europe) via Ukraine 
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006 caused Gazprom to cut off supplies to Ukraine.
This led to a drop in exports to Western Europe, which led to higher prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom supplies its own gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees.'
The Scottish Health Service needs to improve checks on its non-EU employees to check for criminal records, the audit committee said.
The warning from the Auditor General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was implicated in the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Mr Black further expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health had no precise data on the number of overseas staff it employed.
However, his report highlighted other decisive checks, which were carried out correctly on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The Auditor General has been conducting checks on extra-Community staff following the Glasgow airport attack.
Bilal Addullah, 28, an Iraqi-born doctor working at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after he drove his jeep into the main terminal gates.
He was one of three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, suspected of involvement in various car bombing attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experience, and work permits for the UK.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks of criminal records, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Past Criminal Procedure, thus allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
 Although we have found that some information about staff has been checked, this is not always the case.  announces the report.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health does most of the pre-employment checks it would do itself, but he also added:  our report highlights areas where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, said it was "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify employees who might commit future acts of terrorism.
He said 'the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can provide any added value.'
The Scottish Health Authority reported employing 1,161 overseas staff, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General stressed that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of the problems of identifying permanent staff who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current procedures for controls by the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport. 
She added that the Scottish Government, in alliance with the Health Committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report which is due to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, which apply to all employees, including overseas.
Joy Division is dominating the Oscars.
Control, the biopic on the late Joy Division singer Ian Curts, won five awards, including best picture, at the British Independent Film Awards.
The trophies were also awarded to star Sam Riley, who worked in a department store until he was cast as Curtis in this film directed by Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Mrs. Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress for her role in the thriller "Notes on a Scandal".
Daniel Craig, the Bond star, has won the Variety Award for bringing British film to the international spotlight.
The awards were handed out during the ceremony at London's Round house.
Control chronicles Curtis' rise to success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, aged 23.
The black and white film, with a soundtrack by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot on a budget of just £3 million.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first for best director and the second for best new director.
Le Rock also won the Best Documentary award for the film by Julien Temple about Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor award was given to Viggo Mortensen for his portrayal of a Russian mafia boss's driver, in the London-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to British film.
The 50-year-old director, who has made films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel to Indiana Jones, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive the award, named in honour of the late Camelot and Harry Potter star Harris, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the cinema, he said.
I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice.
I was admiring this great actor of today, I was extremely honored
The Independent Film Oscars, better known as the Bifas, are awarded by a jury made up of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa's fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom, who are also known as the "Before They Fall" fans.
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terror plots and is trying to stop them
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells planning an imminent attack on an oil field, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
State television from the world's largest oil exporter, said one of the cells smuggled missiles.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been waging a campaign against the US-allied monarchy since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in the Eastern Province, the TV newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia quickly assembled a 35,000-strong force to protect the sites, following a failed Al Qaeda attack in 2006 on the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper, citing a statement by the interior minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a  missile launching expert  who had infiltrated the country.
It's said that the militants were planning to counterattack with eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees were allegedly involved in the assassination of clergy and military personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more against the Saudi-led forces in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and the US-allied Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the hardline Sunni Saudi.
Al Qaeda militants believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clerics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policies of the royal family that dominates the government.
The militants, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government by Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born leader of Al Qaeda, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
The armed forces have made significant efforts in the last five months, the spokesman for the interior minister told state television.
Among the detainees are 16 members of the Medina who are organized into a  media cell  aimed at promoting  takfiri thought , the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals who support the use of violence against infidel and apostate Muslims.
Among the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the militants.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday declared that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to previously thought.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to Earth's, and might even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect from carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion from solar radiation combined with a slower rotation has led Venus into a whole different kind of evolution.
Today the planet is without water, ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms, and has a surface temperature hot enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a grim glimpse of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why the climate of Venus is so different from that of Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
 Our new data allows us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface. 
Enriched uranium seized by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
A police officer said three people were arrested and the equipment is currently being analyzed.
He did not confirm that it was indeed uranium, but revealed that the merchandise would be worth $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney has declared that he is not fit to be a candidate for president, to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the YouTube debate, during which many ordinary voters have recorded their questions and submitted them to the candidates.
On Wednesday night, November 28, none of the questions were as ridiculous as the one from another YouTube debate, when a snowman asked Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, which is running for the next election.
It is unclear what criteria the producers of CNN, which sponsored the debate, used to choose which YouTube clips to show to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on any single topic, was focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest for the Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they heard something funny: The board has seen increases in approval when candidates spoke in a rude manner.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the National Front, and Mr. Romney, who is leading the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr Giuliani has tried to highlight the fact that he was lenient about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants in his home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked if they would be willing to promote amnesia" (giving illegal immigrants regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates like Duncan Hunter, a congressman from California, and Tom Tancredo, a congressman from Colorado, have managed to dig deeper into this topic.
Neither of them has a chance of getting elected, but both of them stay in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration earlier and more incisively than the others.
In general, the candidates, at least on immigration, have the same views: tighter borders, zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This, coupled with concerns about toxic toys made in China and other fears about the outside world, has led Republicans to forget or downplay the differences between liberal and conservative Catholics.
But the debate became particularly awkward when other topics were raised.
Mr Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the campaign for gun control.
John McCain and Mr. Romney have debated whether or not putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One of the speakers asked the candidates whether they believed in the whole Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to boldly declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even though he is not sure whether he believes the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favor of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, who had been in a position of power in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his longstanding Christian conservatism, would declare that the death penalty is painful, though necessary.
When pressed on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too smart to run.
The human race is unusually open to anything.
Mr. Huckabee's reappearance in Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious fundraising led by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistling in the debate on Wednesday.
These two emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two party protégés cannot agree on who is the more popular and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a successful message about American greatness, bringing leaders closer together.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the workers
Gordon Brown has discovered a new hole to sink into; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, this one is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra-marital sucked toe.
But now a revelation has emerged that a wealthy businessman has been covering up his contributions to the current Labour Party for four years under false names, amounting to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have gotten away with.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister backtracked on his election plan, foolishly insulting British intelligence by proclaiming that opinion polls had not influenced his decision, and that he hoped instead to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, has said, the terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a struggling bank on the brink of bankruptcy, demonstrated a lack of policy and poor judgment in emergency situations.
The inadequate proposals for changes to the tax code have led to a coalition of industry groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data by the tax authorities has revealed an incredible administrative mess.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting military spending cuts: they have proclaimed that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and his former head of vigilance) has caused them to resign.
None of this means Mr. Brown is bound to head for the exit.
However, governments may reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and they don't trust them, but they usually put their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems clear that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for long, when he is in danger of being suspended: the public administration is no longer functioning; the cabinets of ministers are taking stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any purpose.
In a sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to dismiss Tony Blair, he was still his senior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are linked to decisions made by Mr Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation into party funds  cash for members of the House of Lords , voters might think otherwise.
But Mr Brown's predicament is not as tragic as it seems.
The gaffes are not as monstrous as the Tories make them out to be.
Like Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, painful as it may be, could be to implement Mr Brown's usual Stalinist tendencies in favour of a reliable and somewhat brutal government.
The recent political donation scandal is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very particular person who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not his to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has a right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr Watt, who said he knew about Mr Abrahams' schemes, but did not know that they were illegal, will therefore have to be questioned, as will Jon Mendlesohn, the fund-raiser who spoke about the dubious donations in October.
But so far Mr Brown is not involved: there is no evidence that he was aware of these moves, even though most of the payments made were made after he came to government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He was quick to condemn his party's legislative flaw, but he failed to draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, to resort to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
And if the law has been broken, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards of Public Life, which has been without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform of the finances of political parties.
This would force Labour, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead to it abandoning its particular financial relationship with the Confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter like Mr Brown.
But he should face some biased facts.
The Conservative Party now has a good lead in the elections; it has two years to win back the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the U.S. credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see the fins spinning, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. housing market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion spreads from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures the portions of the balance sheet that are not recoverable or are recoverable more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, in part because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody's, the third-quarter insolvency rate of 3.89 percent is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the 2005 US personal bankruptcy laws caused a sharp drop in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and thus insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite high despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicted that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct contagion links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their indebtedness now that fair housing loans have disappeared.
But card issuers are paying more attention to cash flow than to asset value, and so the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in borrowers' credibility.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer mortgage premiums fall if the property costs less than the loan value, so credit card debt would become a priority to pay it all back.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly and flexibly to such crisis conditions than mortgage lenders, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid recovery of stocks.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the loans", said Gary Perlin, the CEO of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a strong risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market bring America into recession, industry will surely face a macabre future.
Watch out for the dorsal fins.
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were supposed to testify in connection with a fraud committed by former Enron chief financial officer, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially pleaded not guilty to seven counts of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam to enrich himself against his employees.
They're due in court in January.
But in a hearing presided over by U.S. Judge Ewing Werlein, Jr., they all pleaded guilty to fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC group, became famous throughout Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains an open question for the investigation that was launched following the collapse of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made it clear to Fastow that he was the subject of a government investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, nicknamed the "natwest three", state that they came to Houston in 2000 to set up a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right-hand man, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind behind many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him rig the bankruptcy proceedings.
In early 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the branch as zero, but in fact the three British banks already know its value.
A Kopper-controlled company bought the interest in the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 to Kopper as interest on that company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely told Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in reality, that $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have gotten $7.3 million while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have won $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in the Enron debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow endured a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for three years and one month in a Texas state prison.
The three Britons were released on bail of $1 million each, which obliges them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, once the nation's seventh largest corporation, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions in debt or even offer its phony speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion in market value loss and over $2 billion in loss to pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their involvement in the collapse of the company.
Skilling was sentenced to over 24 years in prison.
Charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were dropped because of his death from a heart attack last year.
No money, not outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But that's only a small change for some Russians.
 It can carry up to 18 passengers  said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
Although no one really needs so many seats as it is more of a family-run aircraft or for the president of a company .
Mr Firer was at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Fair, a four-day consumer-incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their booths, hoping to attract the interest of the newly rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from maple yachts to cars filled with diamonds like 50 Cent's.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, displayed next to his booth.
"It's a nice car, but nothing compared to our product", he said.
 Russia is the second largest private jet market after the United States 
Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas
 We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists  said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar at the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University .
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's biggest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, at another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to be followed for the sale of luxury goods in markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to Forbes' list of the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study of personal wealth trends in the former Soviet Union by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research.
(The World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here", said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweller Davis Morris.
She was participating in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
The women are all well prepared and the men are worth a fortune.
Walking through the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents, aged 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche", said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her high-fashion dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the newly rich, the kind of Russian-branded buyers willing to queue up at the stop signs to get to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinum knives, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears are on display.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and the best brands", said Mr Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch Porcelain Factory's stand in Delft, facing a hand-made mural by Raimbrant on blue tiles.
 it 's certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling 
Indeed, the sellers here have stated that the Russians with old capital (10-15 years is too much by Russian standards) have already gone from bright logos to a sort of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the fair.
Yet, thousands of people - millionaires, emissaries of millionaires, and tourists - visit the exhibition every day.
And some of them even buy it.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil Beds, said he sold two sets of silk, cashmere, and cotton mattresses inlaid with gold thread.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales director of A1 Motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire a bright orange Porsche for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, the president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to make it look like a roulette wheel.
The four-piece set is $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires", Karapetian said.
He 's definitely gonna keep it in his garage which already holds 30 or 40 vehicles 
Even though many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase  Russian millionaire  is not on the agenda, given the rising real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash", he said.
 there are more than you might think 
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the booth of Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company erected four booths representing British telephone booths, filled with masses of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his team printed 500,000 fake bills for the Millionaire salon.
Passersby stopped throwing lots of bills, asking their friends to take pictures of them on their phones, in the middle of this fake wealth or pocketing a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire", Mr. Karyev said.
Unlicensed surgeon suspected of murder in New Jersey
It was the night before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston was looking out the window of the Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observing an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of the White Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another.
Then I saw the medical vehicle stop, Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
Authorities would later learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now investigators are trying to determine if the cause of her death was due to a gesture performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet determined the cause of Miss Arroyo's death, but they are confidently awaiting the results of toxicology tests that, unfortunately, will take time, but should help solve this mysterious death that has saddened the highest ranks of Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was the assistant to Chief Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious, Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview Wednesday.
 she was like a pit bull 
 she would have done anything to protect me 
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, and that she leaves two sons, ages 14 and 11, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesman for the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said investigators were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died from an unauthorized surgery.
 This is a possibility to consider. 
 the investigation is ongoing. 
Authorities said they arrived at her house around 3:00 p.m.
And finding Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead.
A little over a week has passed since then, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh couldn't confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to determine if any part of the house was used as a medical office.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a withered rose bush rests in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in cooking and for perfumes, lay in a shed, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two off-road bikes hanging from the sides.
McCarthy said that since arriving in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
She said, "You have to be careful about this, you have to be careful about that".
She was there when I came in, and she was there when I left.
 It was embarrassing 
Everyone hopes the Federal Reserve will lower rates due to the global stock market bubble.
Stocks exploded on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped the Federal Reserve would try to calm credit conditions, subsequently cutting interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are booming in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that decision-makers must be  flexible and pragmatic  in their actions in turbulent financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure the fretful markets in the face of these new credit-related tensions, Mr Kohn said that the recent turmoil had partly reversed some of the improvements in market functioning in late September and October.
In the event that this severe turbulence should persist, it would increase the likelihood of further financial rigidity for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments are seen by investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that further interest rate cuts could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped to calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of the financial turmoil was compounded by the announcement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, that it would lay off 650 people, or 4% of its staff, to cut costs to offset heavy losses from losing mortgage bets.
Only 20 positions are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the largest index, the S&P 500, rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2, adding over £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
In the past, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly auction of the European Central Bank's liquidity, which cut its loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and inject more funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, has caused the UK banks' quarterly borrowing rates to grow at their highest since last September, to 6.59% following a sharp rise since 12 November.
England faces a judgment appeal over the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be the No. 6 batsman for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And more importantly in such a broad context as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the selectors who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the president and general manager of England, is starting to fill out the application forms to become a national selector, at least part-time.
Whoever doesn't win the No. 6 backpack will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and so is sports.
It is never easy to destroy what enables one man to reach the top of his profession while another will never get beyond the lower level, sometimes through lack of luck more than lack of skill.
It's not just in cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time to bring Bopara to the surface?
Is that fair compared to Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which one to choose between John Edwards or Banerjee  tubby ?; both, new managers with good degrees, professionals, should be promoted: but there is room for only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
Numbers are important in decision making, but so are opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer has to capture the eye of the captain, at the same time he has to take the gate and a batsman has to be lucky to touch the one-day cricketer.
But catching the eye of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison was in top form and continued to train for the service.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 laps to earn a spot.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 at the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to deliver more.
Whether it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium is a matter of opinion.
That choice could ruin or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five goals and 40 runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primary Test cricketer, and that, despite the fact that his double century against Australia in Australia may still be underrated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and favor Shah's greater experiment against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both of them have good arguments.
In Shah's favour, his brilliant and considerable start in the 88 Test innings in Mumbai, 32 first-class centuries against six for Bopara, who is seven years younger at 22, and his excellent ranking at the opening pitch.
But Shah made only ten innings in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord's, his home town of Middlesex, and that, the immediate rejection by the selectors when Vaughan, once again in form, claimed his place for the next match, seems to have afflicted his obvious impulses in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy in life.
He's not afraid of anything on a cricket field and he went overboard when he recently flipped over on a 4x4 at a presentation of Volkswagen, England's sponsor.
He reported only minor injuries, was shocked, although the first thing he did was to grab his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopara is by far the best batsman, his fast pace allows him to make good services, and he bats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Could this be the true art of selection?
I'd be willing to give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean Shah shouldn't apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, he's the one playing this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus full of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dropping off these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope the city has returned to normalcy.
Some returned to fight the militants who had driven them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived in Damascus transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with Syrian and Jordanian refugees who returned by their own means.
 I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad  said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
 I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is safer now. 
"They say the Mahdi army is no longer committing crimes", he said, referring to the Shia militia of the clerical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ordered his men to withdraw for now.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevents Iraqis from working.
His Shia neighbors in Amariyah called him to inform him that the US-backed militia had helped drive Al Qaeda out of the western capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the head of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was forced to leave his home in northern Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me they had set up an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys.
 That is why I am coming home today  said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many say they have been attracted by the increasing calm in the capital since the American troops arrived, and by the sight of the ongoing formation of well-armed groups of concerned citizens collaborating with the American military to defend their neighborhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51, a father of three, expressed the suspicion felt by everyone about the exiled visas that Shia Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit to force people to return home.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and he pushed the government to stop giving visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq", said the Sunni pensioner.
 I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I was gone 
The decline in violence may be partly explained by the fact that Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are less.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will further increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is a leader in vocational training and even stands out for the international orientation of its higher education institutions.
Only in one area does the Saarland have a deficit similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federal state, by self-deprecation, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is ranked fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
The higher education institutions have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
Until now, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high proportion of foreign students, 15.6%.
The Saarland also sends more than the average number of the country's children to higher education - many of them without a high school diploma.
"In Saarland, the vocational training system is used", says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people graduate from a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are therefore relatively well developed.
In terms of population, the double-degree panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and the growing demand, however, the number of graduates in engineering has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education in Sardinia has forced the higher schools to launch a marketing campaign in engineering science subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a number of reforms in the general schools", says a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced comparative tests throughout the Federal State.
In order to get children to start learning early, the last year of kindergarten is exempt from taxation - a model that has since been copied in other federal states.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether pupil performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk fell from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the Saarland has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better off.
And despite the saros, foreign language proficiency is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise we might gain points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbor is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarras are not French.
Chávez is adjusting the clocks.
In Venezuela, clocks will soon tick differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will set the clock back by half an hour in the South American country.
Chavez is becoming a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, clocks will be set to four and a half hours minus the universal time.
In this way, the South American country gets a time zone that does not exist in any other state in the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position by saying, among other things, that the United States had imposed on the world the separation of time zones into full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the termination of relations with neighboring Colombia over a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would have no relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't, already only because of my dignity", said Chávez, who is hurrying through a constitutional reform that the citizens of the oil-rich country will have to vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, he would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez the mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with the Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spit in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, criticized Chávez on Sunday.
In Spain too, Chávez is in the mouths of all.
A new mobile phone ringing is making the country furious: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that has already been downloaded by more than half a million people on the Internet.
It was uttered by the King of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was angered by the constant interpellations of left-wing populists and told him to shut up.
The German economy is facing a downward trend in wages in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, a real fall in wage values is forecast for German workers this year.
Experts have given various reasons for their pessimistic forecast.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies with low wage growth, higher value-added tax and rising food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research in the Bild newspaper.
New charges may also be imposed on the employee's unemployment insurance.
The Minister of Finance, Peer Steinbrück, told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" newspaper that the planned 3.3 percent reduction in unemployment insurance for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the present situation.
However, the National Employment Agency is no longer entitled to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for loans or financial aid, according to the SPD politician.
It was reported on Tuesday that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices have risen by 3.0 per cent year on year.
Venus is the infernal twin of Earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more like Earth than previously thought. The European spacecraft Venus Express has detected lightning flashes in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, similar to those seen on Earth in winter.
For nearly three decades, scientists have speculated that there are lightning bolts on Venus.
The European spacecraft Venus Express has proved this today - it detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus bursts at a height of about 35 miles [56 km] from cloud to cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the science magazine Nature.
The famous cyprine theory suggests that lightning would have brought life to the Earth. The storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstone of life.
Not so on Venus. "If life existed, it must have been at a very early date in history", explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than that of Earth, and temperatures can reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
"Venus may be the infernal twin of Earth, but it's still a twin", Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar to Earth in mass and size, was struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The November 2005 launch of the Venus Express was a milestone in the search for Venus, as no other spacecraft had been on the way to explore the planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the latest research results, which have now been presented in several articles in "Nature", do more than emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
They also show that the Earth has more in common with our neighboring planet than was initially thought.
So, in addition to the windstorm already known at the North Pole, researchers have found a cloudstorm at the South Pole, which is spinning even faster.
The phenomenon is reminiscent of the air currents in the Earth's hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet in our solar system is almost as massive as Earth and, with a diameter of some 12,000 miles [12,100 km], almost as big.
The planet called the evening star or morning star orbits the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on its own - a day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with a surface temperature of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, is hardly like Earth, scientists speculate that the two planets formed under similar conditions.
On both, water accumulated and remained on Earth as oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has been attached to the Earth as carbonate, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the party dispute over the Dalai Lama's admission to the Chancellery.
In an indirect way, he was criticizing the SPD for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and calls for the grand coalition to close the dispute over the Dalai Lama's welcome.
"We must not present to the outside world a nation divided on this issue", Köhler told the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the Dalai Lama's welcome by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights are universal, even though I respect cultural differences", said Köhler.
The President of the Federal Republic stressed that everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive foreign policy balance, but defended Merkel against criticism that she would organise a new policy on China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional one-China policy.
"China knows it too", Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the Dalai Lama's welcome and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the "front-line policy" of the CDU in foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery, a violent irritation was felt in German-Chinese relations.
The Chinese government has not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to reports in Spiegel, it has also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue between the two countries' foreign ministers.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is now demanding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledge that welcoming the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official functions, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet and other Tibetan regions from China, which also includes other present-day provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with the police, gunfire, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Everything must be done to prevent social discontent in Germany from erupting in the streets with violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Barricades burning, breakers shooting at police with shotguns: after serious youth riots in France, German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not build up in our own country and turn violent.
We must take this seriously", he told the "Neue Presse" in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federal, the federal states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it is already showing its first successes".
But it would be too soon for an end to the warning.
Schäuble points out that, at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or problems of urban planning as in France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had engaged in serious street fights with the police over the past few nights.
In Toulouse, too, cars and public buildings were burned.
The President of the Turkish Communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat, demanded greater integration efforts on the part of the German Government.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "effects of imitation".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But action would still be needed.
Kolat stresses that the unemployment rate among young people under 25 years of age due to immigration is higher than the average.
The first thing is to ensure more places for training.
Kolat insisted: "We have to give young people a perspective".
The President of the Turkish Communities added, however, that more social control in families was taking place in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also don't want to destroy what their parents built here.
Goliath urged: "But we must be careful".
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be consulted on the draft directive.
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything was very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests and a few cars and garbage cans burned.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the suburb.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured in riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the turmoil in Toulouse was overwhelming.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people lost their lives on Sunday.
According to preliminary evidence from the D.A.'s office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of the youths.
In the empire of Angela Merkel.
The Chancellor's entry into the utopian scene shows that the coalition is finished with the bottom line - and that there is nothing more to be expected from her.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her dismal intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which were chaotic and lacking in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by her.
The criticism of too much focus on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It is provincial, she said, and by doing so she has only shown that she does not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear how accurate this criticism was.
There was no real interest or feeling for the problems of the country to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, fleeing into foreign policy and even there staying in the thick of it.
For example, the protection of the climate: in this respect it repeatedly welcomes the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate targets should be achieved in our country.
Even the self-praise - to be so unmodest - the leader of the CDU would have refused two years ago.
Now it's sticking to ready-made formulas that growth would affect people.
It destroys its image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of making the world better.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic political problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few extra sentences for that.
The number of times she misses out on family allowances is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to utter a half-precise sentence.
It's just a little bit of unknown ground, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Branch Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tensions between the candidates are already breaking out on the first subject.
He would have made New York a "refuge for illegal immigrants", Mitt Romney blames his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
Giuliani responded by reproaching the former governor of Massachusetts for employing undocumented immigrants.
The candidates are on the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates are using the debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users uploaded via YouTube are hardly more than blows.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power", John McCain told his candidate Ron Paul, who was the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney, too, is being taught a hard lesson by Vietnam veterans when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture is seen in the reactions of the common room in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are praised or future tax increases are rejected, applause flows through the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites once again lie.
"I made a mistake back then", Romney said, apologizing to the grassroots and the television audience for being a supporter of abortion again in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, is in a dilemma when asked his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf is ruling for the first time in civilian life.
A day after his retirement as army chief, the Pakistani power man Musharraf was inaugurated as president.
Thus ended eight years of military rule.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was sworn in for a new five-year term on Thursday.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live from the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to uphold the Constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as head of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, thus yielding to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
By withdrawing from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another key demand is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on 3 November.
Already shortly after his inauguration, Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, thus fulfilling another demand of the West.
The country's Supreme Court, which Musharraf had occupied after the state of emergency was declared with lawyers from his ranks, last week rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghan border.
The Krautrock Fathers are back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s are playing again: the three members of the band Harmonia have taken their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their comeback, they released recordings of their huge hit "Live 1974".
Even then they were much better known abroad.
The anticipated sensation then comes in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening's poster.
Everyone has their little box in front of them, their cable and, most importantly, their buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, is seated in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
To his left is Michael Rother, a 57-year-old man with a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, all in the auditorium are watching 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is bent over his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it's inadvertently added to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to bother the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the band Harmonia is playing again has caused some emotion among Krautrock fans.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted polls reveal that, while the name does resonate in the collective memory of pop, it is by no means as durable as the band's painfully 32 years of absence.
But why should not the German people also have the right to celebrate their living legends of the 1970s?
Especially since what is misleadingly called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in its country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize to the surviving members of the Cologne Can group in 2003 for their work, the German pop faces were seen in the room questioning.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the amazement was beyond words.
Later, during concerts, Michael Rother would hop on stage with the Red Hot Chili Peppers like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration into the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed for only two years and during that period the power of impact felt was much weaker than what was later attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously performed with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We played in the basements below the Berlin stage.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly worked his way up in Kraftwerk and eventually made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of the Weserbergland.
There, in an old Weser farmhouse, a 16th-century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Community I", where Roedelius had the right to be tortured as a nurse.
More like an artistic existence in the Spitzweg way.
Supposedly, there was a Harmonia Ottenstein choir banner in the trash and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next one was "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as the music sounded, the band was suffering from material misery.
The harvesting of dead wood was not merely for self-searching.
The recently released "Live 1974" CD was recorded at a concert in Griessem to a record-breaking audience of nearly 50 people, as one might recall.
Rother issued at that time a wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
Roedelius and Moebius considered it an immoral requirement.
The band announced their split in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and secured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
The album "Live" by Griessem was produced by Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland set itself the goal of maintaining Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been unearthed on this occasion as Roedelius's own work.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia is taking place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British ex-punk writer of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the inventor of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
The whole range of influence of Krautrock would be circumscribed by this in relation to future pop music.
The space left by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's line hovering in the room amidst the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future".
There are pictures of the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white photos of wired tools in bazaars serve to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But not by attaching microphones to the organ and drums, to make the instruments sound unheard of with self-built effects.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
All three of them are tech-savvy.
Even that, the house choir won't change.
Led by Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sound, and at a nice moment we sing "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about rock.
Roots have been less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not entirely wrong, and Harmonia is not now irritated by it either.
But the most obvious will be covered in detail on stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can be a thrill (?) or a momentary joy.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killing Peace", two films again address the war in the Balkans.
But neither is convincing.
Either the projects are too much based on action and senseless gunfire or they are too tearful.
Here, even Richard Gere in The Hunting Party can't help it.
The good news is that although the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, it is precisely here, in the most bleak backdrop of the Bosnian war, that the actor Richard Gere is found.
We had finally lost sight of the most handsome man of the 1980s, because far too many gentle, futile roles in films with female sentiment and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism robbed him of the urge to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument for watching "The Hunting Party" anyway - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's movies have to be as long and confusing as locomotive drivers' collective agreements?)
He delivers a beautiful, wink-filled portrayal: at bottom, his war reporter character Simon Hunt is what Gere might have become, had not fate and the film industry been so kind: a man whose best days have long been behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his former charm.
But despite this, "The Hunting Party" continues alongside the German production "Killer Peace", which also releases this week, the endless sequence of failed films about the Balkan war.
"Killer Peace" can be quickly made into a trial: the film tells the story of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb woman from Kosovar snipers, with whom one of them soon falls in love again.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not here for once presented as the sole cause of all evil, this film as flat as a television film is lost far too quickly in the action and the senseless exchange of fire.
It's still a kind of Cobra 11 Alarm without a highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can look at the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why there was never a really good movie about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track down the top war criminal "the fox", might have become, with another director and another writer (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go into the forest in small teams, to accomplish something that the military can't do, and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons "The Hunting Party" failed is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the heart-shaped, cynical outcast we're introduced to at the beginning.
No, the script must also give him a romantic affair with a Bosnian woman who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the space of the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves what NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters in the world have failed to do in five years: catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that we should go to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against film logic.
In that case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must be exceptionally in agreement) are not conducting the hunt intensively enough because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the bad this time are so similar that we are reminded of a famous poem by Brecht.
It tells of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how tiring it is to be mean".
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly those tummy-headed, but insinuating how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the genre of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this paper that all Hollywood movies about Iraq were big flops.
We can add that there have never been any good films about South Africa.
And it's always worth it, because when a star hangs out in a crisis center or a minefield, then something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still just too close in time.
Anyway, it was still decades before Hollywood could make a good Holocaust film with "Schindler's List".
Some films are still to mature - those that are now considered classics about Vietnam, such as "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now", or "Full Metal Jackett", were by no means universally celebrated as masterpieces in their time.
But maybe we know too much today about the conflicts of the world, where every slaughter comes live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it made the writers feel the lack of scruples they need to tell great stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The Dictator" actually became as good as that, too, because Lubtisch and Chaplin still didn't know how dominant the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don't have to be good to make good movies.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic, distant artistic gaze of novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionnaire de Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It's just that some things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrific way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia".
Von Beust is getting criticism for cancelling the Olympics.
The mayor's withdrawal from Hamburg's bid for the Summer Olympics has been met with fierce criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to keep fighting for the Waterfront Games.
But von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of odds.
The chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project has been as motivating in the city as the idea of the Olympics.
"Without this objective, the political and sporting momentum could not have been maintained to the same extent".
Schmidt-Trenz calls on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new starting point for it in the longer term, "which takes as its starting point another amended agenda".
Mayor Ole von Beust on Wednesday maintained his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until the year 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides on a bid for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation", Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation in early December, regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time frame we had planned until 2028 up to that point, we will have no chance".
However, the dream is not definitely a thing of the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted the statements made by Beust.
This would give the impression that Hamburg would not be a candidate for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying projects already now", HSB President Günter Ploß said on Wednesday.
The rejection of the application would be in further contradiction with the statements made by the President of the Senate at the plenary meeting of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust reportedly called Hamburg's bid for the 2015 Universiade "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in recent weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD group of the mayor blamed the Senate for not having used this precious time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because it played the Olympics card and excluded housing construction", said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always demanded for Petit Grasbrook a plan integrated into the Olympics and the subsequent use of housing, the CDU has reportedly bet exclusively on the "Event factor".
The bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, on the other hand, is said to have raised a great deal of excitement in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
These aren't Warhols boxes.
The guy who connects the concepts of Sweden and wooden box, he thinks of IKEA, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Right now, wooden boxes made in Sweden are casting a shadow over Warhol's catalogue.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Type Stockholm" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper Expressen questioned the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes a few months ago, internal research at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm has now led to a disappointing result: the six Brillo-Boxes, which former museum director Pontus Hulten gave to Moderna Museet in 1995, are copies - as well as a large part of the hundreds of other Brillo-Boxes of the "Stockholm Type" that circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a bewildering chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes, which are based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come from Warhol (for financial reasons), but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
It was not artwork, but rather models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, which were not exhibited at Moderna Museet.
Witnesses from the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes which at the time would have rightfully entered the history of art and auctions, as authorized original Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes, with the designation "Type Stockholm".
Some of these have sold at auction for over $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum later claimed, wrongly, that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would later give to him.
In fact, the 105 Hultén boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had been dead for three years.
Besides the six Brillo-Boxes in the museum, Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three other pieces from Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and polished, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the 1990 copies reveals that the paint was applied directly to the laminated panels without a backing, using a paint roll - and it is not oil paint, but acrylic.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo-Boxes", suggests Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve. "Unless the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York decides otherwise, Moderna Museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition materials".
Already in July the Authentication Board announced that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that would be raised in the case of the powder soap boxes.
But since then, there's been an inexorable silence.
The rebel soldiers of Manila give up
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are giving up, the same soldiers who had retreated from a hotel in Manila and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who blamed the president for corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters at the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had just stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been trapped in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday for a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly slip away with about 30 supporters.
The military police, who were normally supposed to watch over them, had apparently deserted in his favor and joined his rebellion.
They broke into the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the removal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The troops loyal to the government have closed off the area around the respectable hotel.
The President has called an emergency meeting of the Security Cabinet.
National Security Advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People are sick of it", said Trillanes.
"We're calling on people to join us".
General Danilo Lim, who previously commanded the elite Scout Rangers unit, said other army units were keen to join the march soon.
Critics of the regime had called for a large demonstration against the president on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The Manila financial district was already the scene of the 2003 mutiny attempt by some 200 military members against Arroyo.
The uprising broke down almost 24 hours later when the army refused to join it.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of over 20 per cent in the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We've been speculating on a buy-out before.
The option would remain open to further increase the stake in Versatel.
The aim of this step is to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet reported.
Just before, speculation had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after Berenberg Bank increased its stake in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit union would only hold the money for a third party, the market rumor goes.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a nearly 10 percent stake in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch listed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
United Internet bought 5.15 million of them for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL and mobile phone products.
"We are strengthening our partnership", a United Internet spokesman explained.
The two companies founded the joint-stock company MSP in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For now, both companies want to consider themselves satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not use their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, United Internet said Thursday.
However, both companies would leave all options open, in particular to increase their participation in SA Freenet, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet which has been going on for months is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2,9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1,27 million DSL and full subscription customers.
The United Internet and Drillisch Holding Company has until now held a direct stake in Freenet of 6,01%.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring in about four per cent more.
The right to buy the 18.49% of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
