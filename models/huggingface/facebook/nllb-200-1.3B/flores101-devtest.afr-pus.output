Among them are more medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small kittens (including free-ranging pet cats) who eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as herds.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and cubs.

When a small group of living things (a small population) is removed from the main population from where they originate (such as when they migrate across a mountain range or a river, or when they migrate to a new island so they cannot easily retreat) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.

The original population hasn't changed much, they still need the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't even be called the same species.
we call this process speciation, which just means the formation of a new species. speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
They are still being manufactured today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.

The much-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates motion while maintaining some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds.

In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris while they were surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
at one point, a member of the protestors waved the head of a royal who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to settle a large part of the expenses and the interest on bonds have been driven by the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most breakdowns of technological definitions share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself  follows a path outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn,  produces effects on society that are native, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romantism has a large element of cultural determinism, taken from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
n the context of Romanticism, the physical environment shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture that were associated with that environment emerged, and these things, which are in harmony with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began in about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.

It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.

Because of the slow communication channels, styles in the west may fall behind by 25 to 30 per year.


Sustainable agriculture is a simple, multicultural organic system that preserves seeds that are native to the ecosystem combined with alternate crops or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characterized by their members' age, ethnicity, status, location, and/or gender.
Subculture defines clearly the characteristics that may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
members of a subculture often indicate their membership by a distinctive and symbolic use of styles, including fashions, manners, and informal language use.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, adverse circumstances, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as the children grew up.
Some wild children have been hooked by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is due to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
A child may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
It is claimed that others were raised by animals; some remained on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a wild child displays behaviour (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular caretaker animal, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
while project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting,ladderwork goes a step further.

We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Pregnancy is supposed to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from where they were taken earlier.
Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the uses and rewards approach.
learning andsocializing are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified theirpersonal engagement andcontinuing relationships as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can add up when a person is lying by correctly interpreting the microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his document, The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The process of mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available there.
furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences: suppressed growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to get would be the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
all in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our progeny solved their own protein problem in a waysimilar to the way some chimpanzees on the savanna today.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back to sleep for a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it down.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up so that you can urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses correlates to the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.

With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is activated by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and clashes of system, process and culture leading to the countries falling out.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in real terms, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.

How, then, did these plans become obsolete overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleets has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII. The Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.

Goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and hides.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in herds that roamed the hills and other grazing areas, and were looked after by goat herders who were multiples of children or teenagers, similar to the more ubiquitous sheep herders.
Wasps were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though wasp tracks were mostly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they were pulling to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would have taken to do so on the almost rougher roads of the day.

This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the carts.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people started walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipedal specialties are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.

After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to the printing press of John Dunlap.
Dunlap broadsides, was made overnight.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the grounds of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9.A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Whips that survive are known as the oldest copies of the document that still exist.

Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.

The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.

Both Assassin-bugs and Bed-bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Throughout the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research finds that women are twice as likely as men to get MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to set up an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and take observations also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
s views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from their Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will sustain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external induction.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments that either tagged the DNA in the beak with n radioactive phosphorus or the beak's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the cells that are affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the goal of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studies of ecosystem information.

In this dynamic commuter vehicle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the stable conditions of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.

In developed countries you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water-quality or bridges collapsing.
Why are transport systems generating such complaints, why are they failing on a daily basis?Are transport intruders just incompetent?Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers act within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonably consistent and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships were established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of driveway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings back on the body.
It gives them a wider variety of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are the conch and the day flies.

Aristotle,a philosopher, theorized that everything consistsof a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he did have a theory that they could change into new forms that we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.

Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do certain good or not do it.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.

Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet against different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
Invisible team is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organisation go through such a time-consuming process to set up a learning organisation? One purpose of putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organisation, creativity and wisdom can come through.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome the hurdle can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.

Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition So it narrows the research area and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, tear, and tumor affect the functioning and, in some cases, alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the brain structures and processes like never before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
