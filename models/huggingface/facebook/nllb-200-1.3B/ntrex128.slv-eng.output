Members of the Welsh Assembly Worry They Are "Mupetkom"
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the proposal to rename themselves MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress across the political spectrum are worried about being ridiculed.
A Labour MP said they were concerned in their group because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales, twp is Welsh for "stupid" and pwp is Welsh for "cockey".
A Plaid Cymru MP said their group as a whole was 'satisfied' and suggested other options.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open-minded" about the name change, but also pointed out that there is little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter w is similar to the pronunciation of the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently preparing draft legislation to introduce name changes, stated: The final decision on possible descriptors for Assembly members will of course have to be taken by the members themselves.
The Welsh Assembly was granted the power to change its name by the Government of Wales Act 2017.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals in June and received broad support for the appointment of an assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
For the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Welsh Parliament Member or WMP, but the public consultation received the most support for the option MWP.
Members of the Assembly are clearly proposing other options, but reaching agreement will be a difficult task for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who must submit a draft amendment legislation in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the exercise of the functions of Assembly members and the formation of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will participate in the legislative debate and in the final vote on their appointment.
Macedonians to vote on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its application for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gyorge Ivanov, who opposed the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price they must pay for EU and NATO membership.
Bells at St. Martin's Church have been silenced as churches in Harlem face problems
"The older people I spoke to said there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Adams.
Today is neither.
He explained that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
People are socializing differently these days.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go regularly.
In the case of churches, he worries that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect and that they will soon be back on track.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with shared management (condominiums) to house people who would not help shelter the remaining neighborhoods.
"The vast majority of people who will buy condos in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so the day will soon come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who move into these condos will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became the black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that held services nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black religious community led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, leading a boycott of vendors who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they ordered doorbells.
The Honorable David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells "the bells of the poor people".
An expert who visited in July called them a bit differently: cultural treasure and unreplaceable historical instrument.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these are the first bells to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where they are played on larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said that he was not replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin's has been a complex story with architects and contractors, some brought in by the laity, others by the bishop.
The Sacristy  the administrative body of the parish, composed of lay people  wrote to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese  would try to pass on the costs to the diocese, even though the diocese was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy while hunting lobsters in California.
Officials report that a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday in California while hunting lobsters at the start of the lobster season.
The attack happened just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, and then he and a group of others swam to him and helped him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he realized that he was screaming "He bit me!"
He bit me!
When he got to the boy, Hammel noticed that his entire spleen was torn.
"I called everyone out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!' " he added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue officer Captain Larry Giles said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined to be a non-threatening species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities have blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles said that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty corners they have in department stores, and with a professional staff.
As part of its entry into the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and still growing, while sales of clothing and household appliances are declining, larger beauty stores will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and in more stores next year if successful.
The decision to invest in beauty products was made because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves previously used for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's says they're doubling their beauty product line to 3,000 products and adding brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing offer of LOreal, Maybelline and Burts Bees will also be given more space in branded areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, with most products vegan  something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test a concession in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
With online shopping and small-scale daily purchases at local stores, supermarkets must do more to persuade people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said retail stores would be similar to wholesale stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight the Aldi and Lidl discount with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also the Habitat store since it bought both chains two years ago, which has increased food sales and made the takeovers more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to upgrade its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments have failed.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
It was announced that Lloyds would play a part in this plan, as it was to expand the range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: 'We have changed the look and feel of our beauty spots, improving the environment for our customers.
We've also invested in highly trained staff who will be available to advise.
Our brand offerings are designed to meet all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an exciting beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal
The star of Dragons Day is furious that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly clothing and accessories brand.
The business couple's business was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand.
The host of This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she's stepping down.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Day star Peter Jones by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand deal at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "angry" when the golden girl of television admitted during a heated meeting at his company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new business, worth up to £1.5 million, had left her with little time to devote to their Truly brand of clothing and accessories.
The company was compared to the Goop Gwyneth Paltrow brand and predicted to double its fortune, estimated at GBP 11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of her holiday homes.
The source says "Truly" was by far the most important thing to Holly.
It would be her long-term future, which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned everyone involved.
Tuesday, nobody could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the company's headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse is full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain's most interesting bank connections, would cost the company millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
Besides, it could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were good friends with Jones and his wife, Taro Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple vacationed together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business affairs".
♪ Hard talk ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the media criticism of the comment, which some find "unpresidential", and the positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make such concessions?
Trump, in his mocking "journalist" voice, said:
I'm not giving up on anything.
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in a second meeting, and that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step toward North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea did not see an "appropriate" response by the US to North Korea's previous disarmament measures.
He stressed that instead the US continued with sanctions, which continued to exert pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
But now we have a good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results - they stopped missile tests, helped free hostages and brought home the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded theater, we have 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds dead
For example, in the relief effort in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lomong were displaced, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately been very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is somewhat complicated", said Sumbungova.
Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, but it's unclear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether to allow international agencies to help.
With earthquakes in Indonesia a constant occurrence, the country remains totally unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, this is not common practice on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning was in effect, may have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands presents a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship anchored in Lombok to help earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure a priority of his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for the Joko administration in re-election next year.
Yoko is also facing the pressure of long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored in the late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday to save Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's pass a good 25 yards ahead of Chelsea's goal as his team trailed 1-0.
He put the ball to his left and fired a shot at the far goal.
The bullet traveled high above the penitentiary towards the upper right corner of the door.
The ball eventually went down through goalkeeper Kepe Arrizabalaga and hit the goal.
"I was just trying to get the right position for the ball and players like Shaq always pull it forward as far as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn't think much of it and I just decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time with a goal from Belgian Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker in this action, with a fifth, passed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic gave up fast in the middle and ran forward.
Then he made a nice pass through the defense and Hazard ran into the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defense and shot with his left foot into the distance goal through Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are in London for the Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3:00.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency reported Sunday morning.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were displaced by Friday's 7.5 magnitude quake, which triggered six-meter waves trapped in the rubble of buildings.
Palu, a city of over 380,000, is littered with ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
Police have opened a murder investigation after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling for anyone who has been in the area and seen or heard anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I urge anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on the car camera to contact us as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and her body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime, who thought they knew the woman, and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police are notifying the woman's relatives.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get back to his apartment, but officers told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it could be several hours before they can re-enter.
The officer was heard explaining to the man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying "it's so awful".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon and another one was just outside it.
Several officers were standing inside the cordon, watching the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to write to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with the entry 247 dated 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament has become the latest memorial target of the "re-writing history" controversy.
Its removal would be a poetic entitlement to the destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical Puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society has labeled Crick's proposal "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In today's debate on the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become a target.
Iconicism in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor of the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft testifies to the 19th-century view and is part of the history of a character that some still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more so in the late 19th century than today) as a protector of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.
Killer pig bruised Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the surname Yuan was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig population is being prepared for vaccination at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China on 30 May 2005.
She reportedly traveled with her cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, the door to the neighbor's pigsty unlocked.
He said there was a big, blood-mouthed male pig in the pigsty.
Forensic evidence confirms that a 250-pound pig mutilated a farmer to death.
"The legs of my nephew were bloody and bruised", quoted a cousin named Wu in the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuang arriving at the market Thursday at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pigs were locked up to prevent further attacks while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market's management are supposed to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to suffer severe bodily injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had squeezed a Welsh farmer by a tractor, but then the wife drove the animal away.
After pigs ate an Oregon farmer in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a "spike".
We were just playing.
They're like little children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
"We just need to show them a sufficient degree of respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing heavy rain to the southwest.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to move toward the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico and weaken.
However, Rosa will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane since Sunday morning at 5 a.m. eastern time with winds of 137 miles per hour, located 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area is strengthening over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast, and Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, pushing high tropical humidity northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, mixed with the low-pressure zone, will produce heavy rainfall over the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, deposition of sediment and the possibility of desert landslides.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of rainfall is expected.
Flooding is possible because of the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be very unwise to walk into a desert when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching low-pressure area will bring local rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause minor deposition of flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona late Saturday afternoon and early Monday morning, and late Monday and Tuesday, rainfall will expand.
Heavy rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October can see large temperature fluctuations in the United States as the Arctic cools and the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there's a 20-degree difference.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and spread again.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. will enter warm October with temperatures around 27 °C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York City, it could be as high as 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows a good chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks the intriguing testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as television stations cut their regular programming due to Friday's last-minute reversal: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had grabbed her in a guilty state and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his tumultuous testimony that he was 100% sure that this never happened.
Nielsen reports that the Friday witnessing is expected to be viewed by more than 20.4 million people.
The company has measured the average viewership of the television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting the number of viewers watching the programme in offices.
To put it simply, the audience is similar to that of a football game finale or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose executives strongly support Kavanaugh's appointment, leads all networks in broadcasting the day-long hearing, averaging 5.69 million viewers, reports Nielsen.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, and CNN 2.52 million, reports Nielsen, and the television network was the third-largest broadcaster in the world.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a central role in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanough, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters shouting at him as he tried to get into the elevator to attend a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He hung up for a few minutes while he was scolding, which was captured live on CNN cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
You have power, while many women are powerless.
Flake said his office made a statement, and he added that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the door was shut.
All the networks were live-streaming hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted to put Kavanaugh's nomination to a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as the Democratic minority party had called for.
Flake was partly convinced of this by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have votes to nominate Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of playing political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, accused criticism of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview besides the one with her on the front page, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson escalated his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay each other tariffs was absolutely absurd.
Police have arrested Dytheon Simpson, suspected of killing LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and taken to jail on a charge of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses at the scene, and they contained Simpson's DNA, CBS Television is reporting to WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, police released a statement saying he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
Bail is set at $350,000, according to the attorney.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Special Unit, the State Police Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the people of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "care and justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-3 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
The volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ashes spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday not to approach the volcano as activity intensified in the crater, recording 183 gas and ash discharges in 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of lightning and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in neighborhoods such as Xocchimilco in the capital city of Ciudad de Mexico.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with counter-insurgency police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized vote to secede.
A group of masked separatists, held by police counter-insurgency units, threw eggs and paint in the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually flooded with tourists.
Later, there were also beatings, with police using pendreks to stop the fighting.
Independence supporters, who chanted "No Forgetting, No Forgiveness" for hours, faced unity protesters who shouted "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people suffered minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain in the pro-independence region.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low as opponents of secession largely boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after violent clashes broke out when police tried to stop the continuation of voting in the region.
Pro-independence groups camped out in front of the polling station overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I watched my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a significant, albeit close, victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is rising", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen in the Spanish government,' he said.
Londonderry: arrested men who crashed into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested for multiple car crashes into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm UK Summer Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door was damaged and the building itself.
At some point, they were supposed to fire a machine gun at the car.
With Menga's shot, Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga with her first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston stunned Rangers and Steven Gerrard was forced to concede only his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
The shot of Dolly Menga made up the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied with the Hibernian team in second place.
Gerrard's side have thus been unbeaten on the away streets in this year's championship, and next Sunday they face Hearts, who lead the table and are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his unbeaten streak in the division to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has yet to taste defeat.
Livingston wasted his chances against the direct guest
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, because their directness caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson made the break, but he sent the ball over the goal frame, then Alan Lithgow hit past the goal, and Craig Halkett hit the head over the goal.
The hosts had to let the Rangers play, knowing that they could be a threat to the visitors during breaks in the offense.
And that's how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free throw, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up a stunt for Menga, who shot and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more possession, but the home defense couldn't get through, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his leg, and Lithgow shot past goal from another Livingston interception in the attack.
Submissions continued to come in to Livingston's penalty area, but the home side rejected all the assaults, two offenses  Halkett's offence over the substitution of Glenn Middleton and the offence for hand play  and the referee did not grant a verdict.
 Great performance  Livingston  analysis of the play
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and a score for Livingston.
They've all been brilliant and continue to exceed expectations on their journey up.
The style of play and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited with the way he's woken up the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played a very important role, and he deployed a well-organized defense, while keeping Mengo on the lookout for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers were just short of inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard's leadership, they are seriously lacking in those standards.
They've only managed to beat the home defense once, and it's a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There were disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to attend the grand opening of the new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters - including many Kurds - who do not support Erdogan's government also expressed their opinion, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the division over the visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and despised by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in collision with car
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the Deptford Road in the south-east of the city at approximately 10:15 AM UK time.
The driver of the car pulled over and the paramedics came, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened just months after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
Police said officers were checking the identity of the man so they could notify relatives.
Roadblocks were erected and bus lines diverted, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a raid on a high-security men's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at approximately 9.30am UK time and is still ongoing.
Specialist police from the Tornado Unit have been called in to handle the riot, which involves eight prisoners and is limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A prison staff spokesman said, "We have called in specially trained personnel to handle the riot at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were injured.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and it's clear that those responsible will be taken away by the police and may be locked up for longer.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, the prison was called in by the emergency police unit to intervene in a violent riot in which the staff attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depressions rarely reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa blocks its way through the southwest desert, posing the threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday, but it's expected to approach late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged for more than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall, with individual rainfall of up to 150 millimeters at Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the south-west desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin, are expected to experience 25 to 50 mm of precipitation, with individual precipitation of up to 100 mm possible.
For areas outside the danger of flash flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a real blessing, since the region has been affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some rainfall is likely to be useful, since the southwest is currently experiencing a dry season.
"According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, well over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought", reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa leads first to the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which is still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour [137 km/ h], is 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour [19 km/ h].
The storm comes into contact with the cooler waters of the Pacific and weakens.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
The precipitation in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
 From the Baja California peninsula to northwest Sonora, rainfall is expected to be 75 to 150 mm, with a possibility of 250 mm, reported weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then traveling through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be heavy rainfall in the Baja California Peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest Desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening flash floods and flash floods in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The wounded teenager was found in the Excelsion Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 PM UK Summer Time.
He was taken to the hospital, his condition remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area last night, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are calling on anyone who may have caught the scene on their cell phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered the hostility and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unheard-of tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the hostility and anger" of the Democratic Party in the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "that day, the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage".
"The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to appoint one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I'm really trying to run", he said.
That's why I'm always fighting for the best candidates.
Trump claims the Democrats are on a mission to "disrupt and obstruct".
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a Republican Party adviser told CNN.
The Indonesian earthquake and tsunami killed hundreds, the death toll rises
At least 384 people died in the earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported Saturday, many of them swept away by huge waves that shook the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of 20 feet [20 m] hit the shore at night, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it brought everything to the ground", Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's powerful earthquake is about 200 times greater than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is said to have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He also said that the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, and added that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the Donggala area, which is closer to the epicenter.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely disrupted and they have no information from the Donggala area.
"More than 300,000 people live in the area", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can get worse", they said.
The agency received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not informing the public that the tsunami had hit Pala, but officials say the waves came just as the warning was issued.
Amateur video posted on social media shows a man on an upper floor screaming to warn people on the street of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities report that the military has begun sending relief cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The City Airport was only opened for the purpose of providing assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
According to Mr. Doseba, World Vision members from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where the yard workers set up a fallout shelter outside their premises, but encountered numerous scenes of devastation along the way.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed into Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and personnel assistance are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That's never happened before.
"It is still being treated as a provincial disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can accept international aid, but that status is not yet achieved.
On the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their loved ones are miracles in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a kid out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body lying beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian parachute team, trained two missing parachutists for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others caught at the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
"As mayor of the sailing paratroopers' area, I bear my emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how, in the hours when news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse was circulating in the sailing community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were attending the beach festival.
But his messages were marked with only one gray pin instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages were not delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee downtown
According to a report from Newport Police, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's security employee who was loading an ATM in downtown Newport on the Leeve on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the amusement park and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was at work, another man approached the Brink's security employee from behind and stole a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not give an exact number of participants.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "Being officially Kanye West".
41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for a while and even used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he's supposed to unveil his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "personal reasons", the show's creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has also said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think that ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means you", West said earlier this year, when he was talking about the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So that I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means "one", I changed to Ye. It reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs used to call himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, also used his name in a variety of ways; with or without imagination and in capital letters.
Mexican President AMLO pledged not to use the military against civilians
Newly elected Mexican President Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, just as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
As leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America, soldiers opened fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal organizations.
The US should double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. has no official strategy for artificial intelligence at all.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are well behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chairman of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-rated American player in the game of Othello, and he later became a CEO at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee said that he was aware of previous technology competitions of the U.S. government, such as the robotics competition organized by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and asked when the next one would be so that he could find the next visionaries more easily.
Researchers in the United States must work hard to receive government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best academics, it's the companies", Lee explained.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired the best of the best from universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. step up its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think people with PhDs in artificial intelligence should be automatically given a green card", he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is worse, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, bringing together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a narrow AI committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has been sitting idle for months.
Macedonians to vote on changing the country's name in referendum
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a decades-long dispute with Greece over its opposition to their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to their territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name in June, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gyorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has expressed doubts that turnout will be at least 50 percent, as needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for accession to bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I come to vote for the future of the country and for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission has reported that as of 1:00 p.m., no irregularities have been reported.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, the Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Duško, cast their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia, for a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after handing in his ballot.
He added that a positive outcome would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum, which is less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma showed that 57 percent of those polled would vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent would vote for them.
For a referendum to succeed, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government that took office last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City has overplayed the entire Brighton defence and scored
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguirre's shot in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
The Argentine striker took the pass in the middle of the field at the start of the action.
He ran through three Brighton defensive players and found an open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green players.
He outplayed one of the defenders and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he gave Sterling to his left.
The English striker returned the ball with his first touch in the penalty area to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
"Aguero is struggling with leg problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed he'd play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues the starting lead in the Premier League.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero took a ball deep into Brighton's half.
He passed the ball to Leroy Sane on the left side.
Sane touched the ball a few times, then sent the ball to Sterling against a distant goal.
The Blue Jays' forward pushed the ball into the net just before they were to land past the goal.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12.55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the Rockies and ruin their title shot.
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so there's no special reason for a new offense.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to climb the pitcher's mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, which will only happen if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the postseason, as they have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
The Rockies won the Nationals 5-2 on Friday to secure the least invitation from the organizers, but they're still looking for their first division title.
Even though we can't win anything, at least we'll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a big crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will be playing at probably the highest level this year.
So why wouldn't you want to compete?
The Nationals haven't announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but it's likely Scherzer will pitch.
Scherzer, who will be making his first 34-hit start, pitched Thursday as a relief pitcher, giving him enough days off by Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has compiled 18 wins and seven losses this season with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump at the West Virginia convention
The president indirectly touched on the situation with his selection for Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is at stake in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I'm really trying to run, so I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued: "We have this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, and it's happening right now.
They are determined to take power again, and they will use every means possible to do so.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to beat to get power and control, because that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
He said the Democrats are on a mission to "disrupt and obstruct".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, labeling the Democrats "angry, evil, mean, and lying".
He nominally singled out the Justice Committee's member, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with a loud outcry from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Uh, uh, what.
That was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
She's impatient with those who express their opinions.
When an activist at Momentum, my local client, expressed distrust of me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a line of Labour MPs who are not wanted for expressing their opinion.
My colleague, Member Joan Ryan, suffered a similar fate because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a motion of no confidence for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders on.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years I've been a member of parliament for the local Labour party, most of my Friday meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of most meetings today, and the promise of a 'more friendly and gentler' policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly clear that different views are not acceptable in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I had previously thought shared similar political views were expecting me to change my mind and take positions I would never have agreed with otherwise, whether it was in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - I get criticism on social media, calling for non-election, criticizing the politics of the environment and telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are directed at me are purely political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day, but who do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this policy period is how the rates of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we're no longer open to different opinions, and with every suggestion of mistrust or change in the rules for client selection, it's getting more narrow-minded.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years, to keep my head down and not be so loud, and I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, the reason for this was the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally brought down the classroom at my primary school, I've been trying to advocate for better public services for those who need them most, as a local councillor or government minister.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas on which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I just want to say that I don't understand their willingness to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political expediency will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to the top of the ladder
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this beautifully entertaining championship match of the day.
They're now at the top of the league and the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, the balance was shifted to the home side by their superior defense and better exploitation of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be pleased.
"In our matches so far we have been through a lot of trials and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "Congratulations to the Ayra team, they've taken the opportunity better than we have.
A goal by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr into the lead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, received in a match against the Warriors, meant a numerical overrun for Melrose and Jason Baggott stopped the attempt without a conversion.
Climo increased Ayr's lead on the offence before scoring at half-time and then converting an independent attempt to 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half very well and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot down narrowed the gap to five points.
A long hiatus followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was taken away on stretchers, and Ayr then progressed with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon was then given a yellow card and Melrose re-used the player-over-play with an unadulterated attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of a period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for obstructing Clim without a ball, MacPherson scored on offense.
The Climac scored after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent winger Gregor Henry to the hosts' fifth attempt.
The star of Still Game starts a new career in the hospitality industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is apparently headed into the restaurant business, supposedly to become CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old, in the popular BBC series for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told the Scottish Sun that Kiernan was keen to join the "flourishing hospitality" in Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The Marines are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Navy blue flags are hoisted on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "We have the right to the sea".
It's our duty to get it back.
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of losing a coastline in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive  as is the yearning to sail the Pacific again.
This hope may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on October 1, after five years of consultation.
"Bolivia has a spirit of drive, unity and impartiality and, of course, it expects the result in a positive spirit", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia, which argues that after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia's access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial re-election bid next year, also has high expectations for Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia  and even if it did, it would not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC's decision comes just six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case "wasn't complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not been good for Bolivia, but they may be costing it a lot.
"The current Bolivian government has exploited the issue of access to the sea", Zárateeva said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has sucked out any goodwill that might be left in Chile, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the talks.
Countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia's ambassador to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had made an unusually swift decision.
Monday will bring Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity to enter a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales  still one of the most popular Latin American presidents  used the maritime issue as a political prop.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past".
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen if it cannot trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said his people will never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill its promises made at the meeting of the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently on the verge of re-launching nuclear diplomacy, which has been at a standstill for more than three months after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is mistaken if it thinks that continuing sanctions and objections to the predictions of the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in confirming the prediction without Pyongyang first taking decisive steps to disarm.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to meet again.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about disarmament, which it sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion magazines have unveiled the latest line of giant covers coming to affordable brand stores near you.
If you want to complete your blanket collection or hide completely from the sun, you don't have to look any further.
In their spring and summer 2019 collections, designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a collection of quirky oversized covers that dazzled style at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and designers sent their spectacular creations onto the fashion runway.
Valentine's most striking piece was a beige hat with wide brimmed feather-like accessories, in which the models' heads were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelons with precious stones, a magic hat, and even pineapple  but your head won't warm up.
Thom Browne also showed off a selection of bizarre masks at exactly the right time for Halloween.
Many colored masks have lipstick stitches and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creature was like diving gear with a breathing apparatus and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow the fashions, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that giant covers will be coming to stores near you.
The wide hats closely follow "La Bombi", a straw hat with a 60-centimeter blade that has been seen on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
The iconic brand of the extremely impractical hat that flooded social media has posted another large creation on the runway, a straw bag for the beach that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
A burnt orange raffia bag lined with raffia beads and a white leather handle was the centerpiece of designer Jacques's La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect the big hats and beach bags to be in stores next summer because the designer has made such a strong impression, the requirement for excessive accessories would be hard to ignore.
John Edward: Language skills are key to global citizenship
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding test results, further bolstered by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and their place as global citizens.
As the education sector can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language they understand, the conversation will stick in their memory.
But when you speak to a person in his or her native language, the words go to his or her heart.
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest achievement rates in independent schools.
68% of students who studied a foreign language achieved excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 schools that are members of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of pupils achieved excellent marks in Mandarin, as did 72 per cent of pupils in German, 69 per cent of pupils in French and 63 per cent of pupils in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17% of the reasons employers struggle to fill job vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future career path.
These skills are essential in a global world for future job opportunities requiring language skills.
Learning a second language, regardless of the career path you choose, has a huge advantage in the future with such lifelong knowledge.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically has an advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to communicate, with French being the only language spoken by 20 percent, or 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing more languages, especially those of developing economies, gives children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be of most importance to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from in independent schools, taught by experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I'm not going to lie.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut in the Lakers' uniform on Sunday in San Diego.
For the fans who are looking forward to LeBron James' first game for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn't know how many minutes he's gonna play.
"More than one and less than 48", Walton explained on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play for a few minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six games before the season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is opening a series of campaign rallies in Wheeling, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five meetings Trump is planning for next week, including stops in states that favor him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee for the vacant Supreme Court seat yet to be confirmed, Trump is looking to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump convention in West Virginia, and where can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m. eastern time.
The Trump rally in West Virginia can be watched live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to speak about the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which have become tense over sexual misconduct allegations, which is expected to delay Senate confirmation for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the primary purpose of this series of conventions is to help the Republicans get a new lease of life in the November election.
So President Trump's campaign has devoted these five meetings to "inciting volunteers and supporters" as Republicans try to protect and increase their majority in the Senate and House, Reuters reports.
"Congressional oversight is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Today's convention at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, West Virginia, MetroNews reported, could also be attended by supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, which would draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"For Morrissey, it's a bad sign that the president has to come and "raise him" in the polls", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA still has a desire to win and keeps hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles match
After three one-sided games, the Saturday afternoon foursome may have been just what this year's Ryder Cup needed.
The swing is a completely made-up sporting concept, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where's the swing now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they have four, so it's probably a new start for us", said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four points, and it can take another 12.
But Americans, Spieth said, feel the wind in their sails, and they were motivated, among other things, by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was a fatal hit from the opening punch to the green, and he's setting a good example.
The cries of fortune grew louder and led to the decisive blow, as Thomas and they were tied for fourth with two points behind.
The punch that brought them victory on the 15th hole, he accompanied with a similar scream, one that lets you know he believes the American team still has a chance.
"You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game", said Spieth.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to the glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The unusual but charming duo from Europe have won four points out of four and are unmissable.
The Molliwoods were the only team not to hit a bug on Saturday afternoon, and they also avoided bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which energy seems to flow between them and the buzzing crowd confirm the fact that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and no other player could seal a possible European victory better than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But to talk of European fame would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game with four balls, who was paired with Alex Noren.
The bug and two double bugs on the first nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swede into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
And on Saturday, the players won't have any help.
Four-ball games and two-pair duels are exceptionally interesting to watch up close because of the communication between the couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't give each other, and the way in which strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead before the final day, but the two-two match showed that the US team also has a desire to win, which was doubted by some, especially on the American side.
Europe lead 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe enters the final day of the Ryder Cup with a good lead after a 10-6 lead over the United States in Saturday's four-ball and two-two match.
The great pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, put in their best and won four points with two wins over Tiger Woods at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, which is trying to win the trophy it lost in Hazeltin two years ago, had a four-ball advantage over the wrong American team in the morning games, leading the series 3-1.
The U.S. team was better in the two-man match, where they won two games, but they couldn't make up for the loss.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari (the pair were nicknamed Molliwood) are only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then proved themselves again and even more convincingly beat the worn out Woods and the American journalist Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who dragged through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance for a while, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and two-pair, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning's four-ball game, returned for the two-two match and in a 2-1 tie with Henrik Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked first and third in the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the two-two match, losing the first two holes.
For the only time in Ryder Cup history, a team has come back from a four-point deficit before a single-elimination bracket, although Furyk's team needs only a draw to retain the trophy.
But after two days in another location, a Sunday counterattack may seem too much of a prey for her.
North Korea: Without trust, we will not unilaterally disarm
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are creating growing distrust in the United States and that under such conditions North Korea will certainly not unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho told the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body that North Korea had taken a number of "important measures of goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, demolishing a nuclear test site and promising not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
"We are not seeing an adequate response from the US, however", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain of national security, and under such conditions, we will not unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement was significant because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea wants the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, to officially end, but the United States insists that Pyongyang first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not relented in its call for the lifting of the tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that we must first disarm nuclear weapons, and it is increasing pressure with sanctions to achieve its goals by force, and even opposes declaring an end to the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don't even know us.
The problem is that the continued implementation of sanctions only deepens our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president outlined at the UN General Assembly earlier this week.
The Minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that took place in the past five months, adding: If the problem of nuclear disarmament had been discussed with South Korea and not the US, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have landed at such a dead end.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that an attack on the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the UN, but said he still had a long way to go and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea disarms itself.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timetable for this, saying: "It could be two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
Nevertheless, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The imposition of Security Council sanctions must be firmly continued without exception until we recognize the complete, final and verified status of nuclear disarmament".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Riy on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said that progress had been made, but North Korea criticized him hours later, saying his demands were "gangsterish".
North Korea has pledged at a meeting in Mun this month to demolish the missile test site and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes "appropriate action".
Mr. Moon is supposed to have said that the "appropriate measures" are meant to provide security guarantees promised by Mr. Trump in Singapore and to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on how to take time to rest
The goal of this year's new course at Harvard University is to teach all undergraduate students how to get more sleep, and to combat the growing machismo culture of "night-time learning", where energy is built up with caffeine.
A university professor found that students at the world's best universities often do not know the basics of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to run such a course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, the girl came to him and said, "Why do I only know this now that I'm a senior?"
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, focuses on the key role of good sleep habits in academic and athletic success as well as in improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, says that the decision to take the course was made after discovering that students were significantly sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section is a picture of the door of the student home, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the student accommodation with interactive icons will encourage participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We realize that student behavior isn't going to change overnight.
But we think they have a right to know these facts, just as they have a right to know how smoking cigarettes affects their health", adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that the culture of "pride in experiencing all-night learning" is still present, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students to sleep less are a growing problem.
Professor Czeisler says that getting enough quality sleep should be "the secret weapon" of students in combating stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and in avoiding weight gain.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, attending one of the professors' lectures last year as a freshman at Harvard.
He says the lecture opened his eyes and motivated him to run the course throughout the campus.
He hopes that in the next phase, he will be able to ask postgraduate students to complete a similar programme of study before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock for sleep and wake-up, and he also warns of the harmful effects of "blue light" from electronic displays and LED lights, which can cause an imbalance in circadian rhythm that makes it difficult to fall asleep.
The Rangers have a goalless draw to destroy Gerrard's team.
The Rangers again defeated in the guests' game, Dolly Menga in Livingston, declared Steven Gerrard's team doomed to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since their 4-1 February dominance at St Johnstone, but were beaten by Gary Holt's side for the second time in 18 games since Gerrard took charge, leaving his side 8 points behind the Scottish League leaders.
He attacked me seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lineup didn't seem to want to tie.
With this, Rangers dropped to the regular place, while Livingston advanced to third place, but with the goal difference behind, Hibernian team
The Rangers' trouble was not over, as Calum Spence, the sideline umpire, suffered a head injury when he was reportedly hit by an object from the fans' seats.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the squad that beat Ayr to qualify for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup without difficulty.
On the other hand, Holt was sticking to Livingston's verified 11's, who had taken the Hearts team's point the week before, and was no doubt impressed by how his runaway team had effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession, but Livingston used it better.
The first opportunity came two minutes into the game when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short, who then went for Alan McGregor's goal, but the goalkeeper was inaccurate in his execution and missed the opportunity.
Keagan Jacobs' long free kick then reached captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to score the ball.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game was more about hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite convinced that after the match with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match should be awarded a penalty kick, but the referee Steven Thomson crushed the request of the Colombian in the draw.
The Rangers managed to put together just two shots in the first half, but neither the head shot by Lasan Coulibaly nor the blunt shot by Ovie Ejari posed any threat to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but it was well deserved because of his tenacity.
The Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi for an easy finish to the attack.
Gerrard stepped in and replaced Coulibaly with winger Ryan Kent during the break, who immediately proved himself with a pass to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued his style and forced the visitors into his own game, with Lithgow and Halkett making several pitches before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate on the corner pass.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given a penalty shot in the end of the game after a contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson ruled it out.
Almanah: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from our Sunday edition of the German almanac: On this day, September 30, 1882, more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, who later became a world-renowned physicist, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
It became a fixture in the scientific world and it also found its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play the cowboy scientist:
What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter, used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on headphones, you can hear the effect of radioactivity on the atom in materials.
They're really ringing now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
And the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize invading cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy invading cells
The vaccine in therapy teaches the immune system to recognize the attack cells
This method involves the extraction of patient immune cells, which are then transformed in the laboratory.
After that, they can see the protein that is characteristic of many cancers and then they are returned to the patient.
The results of the experimental vaccine are very encouraging in patients with a wide range of cancers.
One woman who received a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize invading cells lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
This method involves the extraction of the patient's immune cells, which are modified in the laboratory to detect the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many cancers, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2  stimulates the growth of several different types of cancer including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to harvesting immune cells from patients who are trained to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West made an anti-Trump point after his SNL performance with MAGA on his hat.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was booed on Saturday Night Live after a bizarre scene in which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump and said he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After the end of his third song, "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap that read "Make America Great Again", West began attacking Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
It often happens that I talk to a white person and they say, "How can you like Trump when he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago, right?
This time, SNL began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was accused by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was never played, but it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience that he had some problems in the background with the cap.
They got me behind the stage.
They told me not to go on stage with that hat.
They were harassing me!
"They say I'm lost", he said after the Washington Examiner reported.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the lost scene?" and adds that he has to put on the Superman coat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments at least twice prepared the audience for a whistle, and members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed, with one person telling Vanity: "There was a death silence in the studio".
West was invited at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused a sensation with the video for "I Love It", in which he wore a Perrier bottle of mineral water.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR GIVING YOURSELF TO RAYA".
And talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply who he is, and that's okay.
But I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his art) who, in my opinion, is welcoming and spreading an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
"We are, too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "Kanye West", formally known as "Kanye West".
He's not the first musician to change his name, and he's been preceded by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His roommate Snoop Dogg was once called Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then there was the Artist once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder in stabbing at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in Belfast's east end on Friday.
Police say the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the D.A.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has stepped up to the plate against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's thrilling medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who strongly condemned the stereotype of the macho hero, says that the appearance of such roles on screen often makes young boys feel that respect can only be earned by endurance.
Keith told The Sunday Times Culture that he thought something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of the #MeToo movement.
A player who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie admitted to having strong beliefs about the subject.
"I'm seriously wondering right now where we've gone wrong when it comes to manhood", he said.
 What did we teach men growing up about the problems we face today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate and what is learned?
What are we taught on television and on the streets to make young boys feel that they have to choose just that particular aspect of manhood?
I think one of the big questions of our time is, how can we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young men.
In the interview, he also stated that after the series ended next summer, he would not be involved in filming any prequels or Game of Thrones sequels because he had "discontinued with the battlefield and the horses".
The whale will star in the new production of Sam Shepard's True West in November, which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
A player recently revealed that the best thing that happened to Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on set.
"It was through this series that I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on out", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow's character Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say there are more than 820,000 affected people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, a change from the past.
HIV has usually spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
Still, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 people a year.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a very pressing issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very much present.
Because conservative values still prevail in the country, surveys show that 7090% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual intercourse in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of its efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff has released information on Republican senators, condemning "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted information on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these accusations came from individuals and websites on the far right.
"Lies, lies and more unacceptable lies", Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information released under the subpoenas includes the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information was leaked online on Thursday by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanaughan.
The leak came after three senators had finished questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say that an IP address can be used to identify the source of a post that is supposedly linked to Senator Waters' office and conclude that the information was published by someone on the staff, Hill reports.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and pure lies", Waters continues.
My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised by these false allegations, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These baseless allegations are completely untrue and pure lies.
Senator Waters' statement quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"From this denial springs anger", wrote Fleischer.
That could mean he's not a good candidate for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn't do, they shouldn't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not question the motive of the accuser.
He must remain calm.
Fleischer compared Waters's response to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too conspicuously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, took to Twitter.
"If this is true, it's serious", he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her cabinet had notified the appropriate institutions and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for any actions that are harmful and dangerous to each and every member of my staff and to all of them".
Johnny English back in action as Rowan Atkinson as the secret agent
Looking for Brexit hints in any new British film has become a tradition, and so has the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came out in 2003 with Johnny English and followed up in 2011 with Johnny English 2.
Is a funny satire about how bad we are going to be a new export opportunity for us?
The incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes puffed out and unusual grimaces, gets permission to re-mix the strings; his name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
It's about a rogue secret agent who, despite his bizarre moves, includes a piece of Clouseau, a Mr. Bean duck, and a tiny bit of the one who contributed the final note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It's also based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real mess.
The latest film, however, presents one or two pleasant moments.
I loved it when Johnny English approached in a helicopter, wearing medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly touched his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but the humor seems a bit bland and overly unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission: Impossible now offer comedic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems that the comedy is aimed at children and not so much at adults, which is why, to me, the offbeat adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent sketches as Mr. Bean.
The constant theme is now that it is clear that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated the network of Britain's most secretive agents, exposing the identities of all British agents, causing major trouble for the responsible agent, played by Kevin Eldon in a surprisingly small role.
This is the turning point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already experienced a breakdown due to political disapproval: Emma Thompson has tried her best to play the supposed Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that she can help herself with.
Intelligence informs her that all active spies have been exposed, and she must choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a prestigious school, who informally teaches how to operate undercover: here's where the writers are at, because English runs some kind of spy rock academy.
England is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets his longtime associate Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports fanatic, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are prepared to create more trouble in the name of Her Majesty's Secret Service, and in the process they meet the fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: that's the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos by sneaking onto the deck of the Volt's yacht, and when English attempts to use virtual reality glasses to see inside the Volt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite its charm and energy it is reminiscent of a children's film.
Very average.
And like all the other films by Johnny English, I can't help but wonder: Is a British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that they are planning a four-day working week for Britons, with the pay for a five-day week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The client wants the savings that companies make from the AI revolution to be passed on to workers, giving them an extra day off.
This would give employees a three-day weekend with the same high pay.
Sources say the idea fits the party's economic plan and plans to put the state on the side of the workers.
The trade unions are in favour of a four-day week as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is due to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-week workweek is a goal we will strive to achieve through the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the four-week work week was supported by the Green Party in its campaign in the 2017 general election.
This is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-week work week is not party policy and the party does not think about it".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to wrest power from the "reckless directors" and "procurers" of municipal corporations.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not regain full stake, as the Labour party could introduce deductions on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
It also confirmed plans to include employees on the boards and to introduce the Ownership Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10 per cent of the shares in private companies to employees, thus receiving annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, on 60 Minutes, discussed whether the Kavanaugh investigation by the FBI might change their minds.
The FBI's indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the office could convince any Republican senator to withdraw his support for the judge.
In an interview aired Sunday, a reporter for 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to it than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh before the hearing began.
When I called him, when this accusation came out, I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, unwavering, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, on the other hand, seems to be carved into stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and I'd need a very compelling reason to change it", he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I do know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of those she named could confirm that.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it contributed in any way to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring a truly extraordinary array of stars with the same extraordinary mission: to end world poverty.
The festival, now in its seventh year, will bring tens of thousands of people to the Great Terrace in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks or acts, such as volunteering, writing a letter to the world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is the Global Citizen movement, with 12 years to go before it reaches its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to demand action, or is this just another example of so-called clictivism  creating the belief that people are actually having a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or by tweeting?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters since 2011 in pursuit of a range of goals.
He says that these actions have helped world leaders make commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group stated that its actions would result in 390 commitments and communications, on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to helping children reach their full potential, who pledged $35 million in aid to help end malnutrition in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in the historical record", said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for the Power of Food Partnership, to the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced that it would co-finance the Power of Food project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutrition measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen movement responded: "It's going to be a long and hard road. Sometimes we're going to fall and we're going to fail".
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to block Russian energy exports.
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is reported to have said that Washington could use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy sales, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
'I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,' I would say.
But the official believes there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States can handle this, the Navy can keep our sea lanes open and block them if necessary, preventing Russian energy from entering the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing participants at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that calls itself the "Voice of Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it was essentially the same.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence fuels and their substitution", he said, calling Russia a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments came as the Trump administration seeks to increase its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, ostensibly by displacing Russia, which is a significantly cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the "unsuitable" Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says would make Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the USD 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is strongly opposed to the project for economic reasons and that it is unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we share the view that energy should not be used as a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the American position and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find third-country interference in our energy supply a major problem", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), following the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" her candidacy for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "carefully consider" her candidacy for president of the United States in the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she's considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman leader", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will give my candidacy for President a thorough consideration.
Warren was at a town hall meeting, cheering for President Donald Trump, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
"What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the election".
A poll released Thursday showed that a majority of her own constituents believe Warren should not run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not run for president.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that former governor Deval Patrick had the most support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting her and 48 percent opposing her.
Other top Democrats who might be considered for the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke at a rally in support of Donald Trump, referring to the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin.
Track Palin, age 26, spent a year in Iraq after he enlisted.
Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through after returning, connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and the degree of injury that our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son's arrest as an "elephant in the room", saying that her son and other war veterans were returning somewhat altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the comrades and airmen and all other members of the military had given to the country was.
Trac Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, assaulting a woman, obstruction of justice, and possession of a firearm in a controlled condition, said Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang or domestic violence their right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal challenge to the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been released.
She said she was abused by her partner and his violent gang-member sons, but on July 20th, U.S. authorities denied her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
Federal prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which are home to many asylum seekers in the United States, as countries that are constantly confronted with gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy in 2014 overturned a decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle, states the application before the court.
The prosecutors further argued in the request that a policy of denying immigrants the right of entry harms the U.S. economy, as it is more likely to make them entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she consoled her hot boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
The rescue team is constantly bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
It looked like townspeople returning to their destroyed homes, poking through the soaked stuff, trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a back and shoulder injury, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuous strong aftershocks.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the tremor that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to escape.
I think I was squeezed against the ruins of the walls, Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "inciting" by "propaganda ads".
A week after a four-page Chinese newspaper ad in the American daily praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China in Beijing accused the American press of being misused for propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned the paid-for edition of China Daily in the Des Moines Register  the top-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials described Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington's increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war, exchanging blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to hurt exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on this harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government has exploited America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press to run a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the Beijing newsstands and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens about China's worrying economic path, as the communities are tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers" had turned down an offer to publish "his article", although he did not specify which one.
Republicans are losing their vote in the midterm elections with a Kavanaugh split, analysts warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the top Republicans who support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite multiple sexual assault allegations will be met with a vote-loss in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment here is extremely high, and the majority of Republicans have already said they want to continue with the vote.
"There is no turning back", said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it tomorrow or in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November Comes!" as they demonstrated in the Senate corridor, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic news portal reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all bounds", Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told reporters.
People say they're strong now, and they're right.
But it could be even stronger, especially among undecided suburban voters and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president but do not vote often.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault of a Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that continued Republican support could have negative consequences.
"It's become a big mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just the council vote or the final vote or the Kavanaugh oath; it's also the way Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in the election, told the network.
Americans, however, seem to be somewhat divided between whether to believe Ford's testimony or Kavanaugh's, with slightly more support for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents said they believe Ford's testimony most or certainly, and 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh most or certainly.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during the testimony, compared with only 30 percent of those who said so about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a state of guilt when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her sex at a party they were having while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that's building on Berners' open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "rule the world".
"We decided to do it now", he said of the new company.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create personal data storage or POD
This may include contact information, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being available in one browser at the same time.
The peculiarity of a personal data store is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls this 'data empowerment'.
Executive Director John Bruce says the company's idea is to pool resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company is currently being built by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was bought by IBM, a few developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
This week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and the group are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they could implement a complete change that could abolish all their business models overnight.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to "provide commercial energy and ecosystem protection to protect the integrity and quality of the new Internet built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute after the company is established.
"I am extremely optimistic about the future of the internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The feast of the Victoria Cross winner of the First World War
For 100 years, my hometown has been celebrating the award of the Victoria Cross to the only Anglican clergyman to have won it as a World War I veteran.
The honourable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann has earned recognition for his actions on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never learned that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the Colonel's grandsons uncovered a memorial stone.
One of the great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the deed of his grandfather for which he earned the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal, "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he climbed towards the line of fire and led the line forward with "the greatest heroism", then attacked the engine room himself and hit three members of the squad.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 2018 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never achieve, so it teaches me humility".
She and her brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade, conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to be able to participate in this parade" and "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and instead got Pussy Peep.
Imagine: You stay up all night to watch a sold-out Bellator 206, and then you can't see the main event.
The San Jose event featured 13 matches, including six on the main stage, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned to find that the broadcast had been replaced by a cartoon of Pussy Peep.
Many were not very happy, for he stayed up until the morning because of the duel.
One fan tweeted that the switch to a children's cartoon was "a sick joke".
"Under government regulations, this content at 6 a.m. is not appropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
- The Pepa Pig, yeah.
The president of Bellator, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include viewers in the United Kingdom in the future.
"When I think about replaying, I think we could arrange that", Coker said.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we can't get it done until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of messages exchanged during the switch, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it; we assumed it was just a technical error.
But the real reason was a government decree.
I can promise you this won't happen again.
Instead of six, we're going to have five matches as usual, and we've tried to exceed the expectations of the fans, and we've been successful.
It's a very ungrateful situation.
Tom Daley felt "undervalued" about his sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said that his sexual orientation made him feel inferior to everyone else, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that "no one is who they are" when he entered high school.
In an interview on the first episode of Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke out for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent diminished his desire to win the Olympics.
The longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, has been out of the program for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on the first episode of Laverne, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and of being different are the real thing that gives me the strength and the perseverance to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said he wouldn't disappoint anyone who finally found out about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an influential advocate for LGBT rights, appearing twice this year at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on states to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to speak out without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised by his romance with the male American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but he says the age difference never posed a problem.
"When you're so young, you experience so much". "At 14 he participated in his first Olympic Games, and three years later his father died". "It's hard to find someone of his age who has experienced the same ups and downs".
The couple adopted a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, in June, and Daley says it changed his "overall outlook".
"If you asked me last year, all I'd have to say is, 'I have to win the gold medal,'" he said.
But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
The son bears the same name as Daley's father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked was if he had tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, "This time you're not going to be in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally had to admit that he wasn't invulnerable", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and achieved a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd been dreaming of all my life, diving in front of a local audience at the Olympics, and it was the best feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of the song  Proud by musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and at which his skin still warms.

Unprepared Mickelson has taken over the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday, when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he'll have to get back in shape again to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will be competing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was let down by Captain Furyk at Saturday's fours.
Instead of being in the spotlight, as he so often was for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day partly as a cheerleader and partly improving his game to correct what was weighing on him.
Given that even at the peak of his career he was not the most straightforward, the 48-year-old is not the best fit for the narrow course of Le Golf National, where a long iceberg inevitably punishes missed shots.
And if the field alone wasn't scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open's defending champion Francesco Molinari in Game 9 on Sunday, who has tied for the league lead in all four games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are four games behind the starting lineup of 12 individual games, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could prove to be the deciding game.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he didn't say much.
"He fully understands the role he played today, he patted me on the back and he hugged me and he said he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the stars and he's made tremendous contributions to the teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we felt it was the right thing to do.
He wants to play, like everybody else.
Mickelson is set to break Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder Cup career, which never really matched the height of his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, but Furyk said his presence on the team also brings some undeniable benefits.
"He's funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make people crazy, and it's great to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun when they played him this week, which was fun to watch.
It's much more than just a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major advantage may soon be the scoop
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup individual events can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where the side, captained by Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they were beaten by a hair-only goal with a score of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"Don't forget that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but barely", said Bjorn (pictured) after watching the Class of 2018 team win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and lead at Le Golf National with a 10-6 lead.
So history tells me and everyone on this team that the Cup is not over.
Play full time tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
The game's not over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that's what we have to stay focused on.
He's been saying all along that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we're also very aware of who's on the other side.
Bjorn, impressed by the play of his players on a challenging pitch, added: "Here I would never have rushed.
Tomorrow is a different day.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on individual games, so we'll have to do it differently.
It's nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you're there alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
That's the message you need to get to the players, tomorrow, you need to bring out the best in yourself.
Now leave your partner behind and let him get the best of himself.
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of the turning point on the final day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as the loser when Europe performed the "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, led his players to the final day of the game.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we'd like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
Once that momentum gets sustained, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We created the right setup and put the guys in a place where we felt like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned to try to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the best game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I chose this order of succession for this group of boys because I think it covers the whole schedule", said Bjorn about the selection of individuals.
New German warship again delayed
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to system failures and rapidly rising costs, it will not be commissioned until at least next year, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, says the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship is due to join the navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is beset by troubling questions after delivery.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels, ordered in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and certain cloaking technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals  the latest frigates could remain out of home port for up to two years.
But continuing delays mean that the advanced warships that were supposed to enable Germany to exert influence overseas will be obsolete by the time they are commissioned, notes the newspaper Die Ziet.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German authorities have cited a number of key "program and technical deficiencies" which would render the warship useless if it were to be sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 seamen  only half the workforce of the older Bremen-class frigates.
The ship also proved to be considerably overweight, reducing its capacity and limiting the Navy's ability to upgrade it in the future.
The 7,000-tonne ship Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice the weight of similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the whole project  including crew training became a problem.
This is expected to reach a hefty EUR 3,1 billion (USD 3,6 billion)  from the initial EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "short of ships fit for deployment".
The official said that the issue became more acute over time because the old ships were being dismantled and replacement ships were not being provided.
He regretted that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway at a farm in the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats use food to hunt for food.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study will involve scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) monitoring small and fine bats, brown-tailed bats and peripheral bats at the Inverewe Gardens property in the Wester Ross area.
Special cameras will be installed at key locations on the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of the bat calls and what species they are doing.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behaviour across the province.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the preservation of forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects shelter and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as mosquito nets and certain types of chemical treatment of building materials, pose risks, as do housecat infestations.
Bats are not actually blind.
Their nocturnal habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to accurately identify errors and obstacles in the flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for supplying more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, check shelters and occasionally rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and so far only bat sanctuary in Scotland on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is ideal territory for them.
"We have a great bat area on Threa", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and all kinds of good habitat.
But there is still much to be learned about bats, and the work we are doing here and on other farms will help us to understand better what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the holdings, as the possible accidental destruction of a single bat hatchery could result in the death of up to 400 females and young, which could mean the decline of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is forbidden to destroy their nurseries.
Elisabeth Ferrell, head of the Scottish Bat Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we simply don't know how well their populations are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges, lawyers prepare for German magazine lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of rape he allegedly committed "fake news" and said people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was to pay her $375,000 for keeping quiet about the incident.
In an Instagram Live video address to 142 million followers hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, branded the reports as "fake news".
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they said was fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
That's the way it is.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, which is part of the work I do.
"I'm a happy man and I wish everyone well", the actor added with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "non-material damage" in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
The documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada, alleged that after meeting at the Mayor's nightclub with Ronald, she returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he was a 99 percent good man who only disappointed in 1 percent.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that the hospital took pictures of her injuries, and later arranged for an out-of-court settlement because she was "terribly afraid of retaliation" and "worried about public humiliation".
The 34-year-old claims she wants to cancel the settlement because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of a move from Real Madrid to Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer, he made a $100 million move to Italian giants Juventus.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was 'worrying' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker said that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant , which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis models , produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our plant would stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been expressed by other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of 'in time', with parts from UK and EU suppliers for cars on order arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU on 29 March without a deal, this could lead to border disruptions, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota could not store parts for more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, company representatives said, and therefore production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was 'extremely well-timed to avoid such border checks'.
"We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not just to enjoy the momentum, but to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The data from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we must be absolutely capable of continuing the highly successful supply chain setup.
Toyota was not able to comment on how long the production would be stopped, but warned that in the long term the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: In my experience, jobs lost are never recovered.
The government spokesman said: We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could have been rescheduled, says White House
Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be delayed for another week because of the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of justice.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been fueling Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing using a bug to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
And last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that he was planning to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at a United Nations conference in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would not fire Rosenstein, and the meeting was later postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The date is not set yet, but it could happen this week, and given everything else going on at the Supreme Court, we could postpone it for another week".
I'm always happy to keep you informed.
Some reporters would object to that, but Sanders hasn't called a White House press conference since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings could not be attributed to resistance to the "setup" of TV announcers, but she said: "I could not deny that they are set up".
She then mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The President holds more press conferences than any other President before him, she said, adding without citing a source: We looked at the figures.
The meetings will continue, Sanders said, but if the press can address the president of the United States directly with their questions, it's infinitely better than discussing it with me.
We're trying to make this as possible, and you've seen that we've done this a lot in the last few weeks, and you're going to have a conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly takes questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting heads of state.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this week, when he made a frank and somewhat bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
Letter from the Minister for Health to EU staff at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to continue the work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applying for the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued over the summer, with a decision coming this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
So I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie in emergency surgery after head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of The Tennessean.
The head coach at Tennessee State University told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the edge of the field and kind of froze there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further examination.
An official at Tennessee State University told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details of the type/scale of injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the University, is playing for Tennessee State University for the first time since transferring from the University of Illinois.
He had a combined five shots on Saturday before being out, bringing his total hits for the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee for purchasing property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the Tories' new plans.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
Increased rate of charge for non-payers of UK tax
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year, to be spent on helping the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of rent for property purchases in the UK, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The poem is to be understood as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises of affordable housing and higher taxation of high-income earners.
The increased fee will be charged to individuals and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional money will boost the government's efforts to end homelessness.
The gain  to be charged in addition to the current rate, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and rental properties  could amount to no less than three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year by introducing the measure.
It is estimated that non-UK residents would buy 13 per cent of newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and more difficulty in buying the first property.
Many affluent areas of the country  especially in the capital  have become ghost towns as the number of shoppers spending most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the toll to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of raising prices by grabbing land they don't actually use, and urged Mrs May to drop quotas for affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shame.
Mr Corbyn has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions without fail.
He also wants to give city councils more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would devote my premiership to rebuilding the British dream, that life must be better for every new generation.
It also means fixing our dysfunctional housing market.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
It cannot be right, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy a home as it is for UK nationals in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant, and the humiliation of homelessness is too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland club".
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to one day become manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points short of the top-ranked side.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren were relegated to the Scottish Championship last season.
I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got a B cap and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in the Hampden as a kid, so it was always something that drew me back.
The only way I'd get this opportunity is if I was successful in running the club.
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic, who has previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as the successor to such big names, he has no fear.
"My success is measured by the question, 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
The club is clearly in the First League, given its structure and capabilities", he said.
The road to it is not easy, but it would probably be considered successful only if the club could get there again.
Ross has only been managing for three years, after being assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent relegation to the third tier, and St Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably the real turning point", he recalled, "of taking over Alloe.
I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than acting.
It sounds funny, because I was doing well as an actor, and I was making a fairly good living out of it, and I was also achieving some greater success.
But the game can get tricky.
There's a lot of stuff to deal with every week.
I still struggle with that in terms of the stress and pressure of the work, but I just feel like management is the right thing for me.
I've always wanted to run a club, and I'm doing it now, and I feel most comfortable in my own skin in my entire adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sunday 30 September on Sportsound on Radio Scotland between 12 and 1pm (BST).
The ideal time for a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of hard-to-reach British pubs, but it has also increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business adviser who produced the data, said: The continued sunny weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation meant that July followed a similar pattern to June last month, when pubs' revenues increased by 2.8%, only restaurants were hit even more.
The decline in restaurant traffic of 1.8% in June intensified in July.
In comparison, pub and liquor bar traffic increased more than restaurant traffic decreased.
The sunny weather also led to a decline in sales in pubs, which mainly serve food, but not as dramatically as in the case of restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drinks sales increased by 6.6 percent in one month, and food sales decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman of the RSM Leisure and Hospitality Group said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The biggest factors in the sales in the hospitality market remain the weather and the influence of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a year-on-year decline of 4.8% will be particularly painful due to continuing cost pressures.
For food shop owners, the long hot summer could not have come at a worse time and only time will tell whether the recovery needed will bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2,7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the introduction of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales metric in the pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups with a total turnover of over £9 billion and is an established industry reference.
One in five children has a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents
Research has shown that one in five children, some as young as 11, have a secret social networking account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram pages
The news reinforced fears about the publication of sex-related content
20% of pupils said they had a main account for their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 years old - has created a social networking account that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts.
The news reinforced fears about the publication of sexually explicit content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a censored "main" account that they showed their parents, but they also had private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter noticed that the daughter was inviting visitors to rape her.
A survey by the Digital Awareness UK network and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools showed that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are falling for temptation and creating an online space where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to tap into her extensive experience at international level over the last decade.
"Eilidh is held in high regard in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that Scotland's athletics would benefit greatly from her inclusion on the board", said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for the athletes, and I hope to be able to really contribute and help to the running of sport in Scotland".
An American who won four Olympic medals in the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC has been left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I could recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!
An ad for a breast pump comparing mothers to cows has split online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has issued a statement comparing mothers to cows at milking.
To launch the marketing of the first portable silent breast pump, consumer electronics company Elvie released a provocative music video advertisement that was supposed to show mothers all the freedom the device offers.
Four real mothers dance with cows in a haystack to a song that includes the following words: "Yes, I'm pumping, but there's no tail", and "If you haven't noticed, those aren't my nipples, those are my boobs".
The assembly continues: "Enough, exhaust, I feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, I squeeze the nipples".
But the ad posted on the company's Facebook page caused considerable online uproar.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was a joke about the "cruelty" of the dairy industry.
Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they also get pregnant and milk to produce milk, but their babies are stolen in the first few days after hatching", wrote one.

The other commented: "Of course, it's traumatic for both mother and cub.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?
Another added: "A sound that is completely unfeeling".
Others praised the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "crazy".
I think that's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one too, if she was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I pumped.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it the way it was meant to be.
It's a brilliant product, wrote the other.
Someone commented: This is a funny ad targeting mothers who are exhausting their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an ad praising or condemning the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of the action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby, and even do outdoor activities while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mothers, further commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation".
By drawing a parallel between women who pump milk and dairy cows, we wanted to bring the focus to the pumping of milk and all its challenges, while at the same time providing a fun way for women to connect, to show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to hand children over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that by requesting a child they would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these convicted foreigners.
That is why we are continuing to search for these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that will require some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, as was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will appear by videoconference rather than in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be expelled quickly.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to shelter workers and reports in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of distress are more likely to go unnoticed because of their size.
They added that moving children to a tent city without emotionally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye to friends can complicate the trauma many of them are dealing with.
Syria calls on the US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country is now in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they will be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is "almost over".
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we clear Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were right for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fears" that persuaded the refugees to stay abroad.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to help facilitate their return", he said.
 They are turning what should be a purely humanitarian issue into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has created an opportunity for resuming political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear horizon" and expressed the hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would be "eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first session of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
By this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with interpellation and scandal.
What would be without a doubt the most dramatic presidential finale ever!
So far, there's no sign of any tiredness in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN's peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC's has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has the highest cable subscriber count with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of the drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, acclaimed comedy writer and author of "Just Funny Parts: And Some Hard Truths About Sniffing at the Hollywood Boys Club", offers a different explanation.
Remember the cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election?
The driver told her he was voting for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is being portrayed on television, the story from Washington could decide the future of Roe v. Wade in terms of whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The switch is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, a six-hour look at a roundtable of experts discussing the use of deep-seated sources for Bob Woodward's book Fear, a $15,000 leather jacket (a coat thickly covered in bloat, The Washington Post said), and the consequences of Trump's shocking, um, anatomy descriptions.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same again.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it offers something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a show about the cast of the Trump show and the daily scripted scenes (the NFL fight, Kim Jong Un's praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was stunned inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He couldn't get away with it, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced a Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
I remember back then we were making all these crazy shows and people were saying, "This is the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.

Foreign money is being raised in preparation for the closest midterm parliamentary elections
Not surprisingly, the 17th Pennsylvania District is seeing a flood of money, as congressional redistricting has seen two candidates running for the same seat.
This recently redistributed suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in the second district.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th district.
The cards were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been unconstitutionally drawn in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district touched on the campaign finance battle between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat has been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a slight advantage.
In the U.S., they were considering sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, then they backed out.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varello in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to recall the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the recent decision to withdraw recognition of Taiwan, said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the Department of State, in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered in relation to El Salvador, which is estimated to receive US$140 million in 2017 in US aid, including anti-narcotics aid, development aid and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and murder rates.
During internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in preventing migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
Three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss them on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be a report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice, which is now abundantly documented in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to those authorities and perhaps even to a jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions, and I don't want to say that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, nor is that of his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we're going to have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could be.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to strike at Hitler if the West resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, missing an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is reversed, accelerating or halting the unrelenting march of democracy.
Americans are facing several such breakthroughs right now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has the fate of the Mueller investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in the spotlight since this paper reported that he suggested secretly filming the president last year and speculating that he was unfit for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
What will we do if the FBI's requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And most importantly, will we vote in a midterm congressional election that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could we not be optimistic about our future?

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it clear that a win over Austria after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify from the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented striker Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in a 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
"It was a point we deserved because Villarreal is a strong team", said the 31-year-old.
We came into the game believing we could get something done and get the point.
We might be able to score a win in the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There's another big European night on Thursday.
We hope we can get three points, but it will be a tough game because they scored a good result in the last game, but with the crowd behind us I am sure we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year has been difficult, no doubt, given everything that's happened, including injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying themselves; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and make it a success.
Women's sleep problems due to fear of saving
Although respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few discussed this with their family members.
Half of the respondents to a Nationwide survey said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they discussed the matter with their children.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't bother to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not talk to them about it in time.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in estimating the cost.
Involve a financial adviser: Your financial adviser can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and life insurance policies to cover these costs, or self-insurance, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Be prepared for legal battles at the transition.
Choose a health representative by appointing a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that your health care wishes are taken into account by the professionals if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also authorising a person to manage your finances.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Think of the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write this information down in your action plan to prepare you.
"It's not just your finances. Do you know any doctors?" asked Martin.
What are you taking?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
I have this plan ready.
A man was shot multiple times in Ilfracombe with an air rifle.
One man was shot multiple times by an air rifle as he returned home at night.
The gunman, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot multiple times in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at approximately 2.30pm BST, as an "accidental act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are calling for any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications disrupted, rescuers from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake, could not get any information.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province that stretches along more than 300 kilometres (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of Central Sulawesi Province are fisheries and agriculture, especially in the central Donggala region.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but it is mostly carried out in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also hit northern Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur regularly.
Some major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have included:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed an estimated 226,000 people along the coast of India, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A landslide hit Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing death and panic as people remembered the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not trigger the tsunami, but the collapsed buildings killed over 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily held thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Trac Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers said Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin's acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, but he took her phone out of her hand.
Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Prison and is being held on an unsecured bail of 500 USD, KTUU TV reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty to "the charge of negligence" when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with one count of Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
Palin's not the first time he's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people died in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the moment of the quake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were stranded in the city of Palu for a beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the rare death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare execution for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented van to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, when he ran over several pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" caused serious bodily injury, according to a notice of execution filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, any one of the charges could be grounds for the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury heard Saipov's 22-count indictment, which included eight counts of murder in aid of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saip's methods as "shameful, cruel and disrespectful".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damián Pagnucco', is stated in the notice of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last death sentence was handed down by the Southern District Court ten years ago.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, and finally in September 2009 his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
The last death sentence in a federal case in New York City was handed down in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed for conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a national of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he had watched on his phone.
Police also said he requested the unfurling of an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts of the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a plea in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of parole for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events", Patton said.
Saip's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
The Brexit negotiations should be entrusted to Nigel FARAGE, Tory MEP
Nigel Farage has promised today at a protest at the Tory conference to "mobilize the people's army".
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" of Eurosceptics when one of his own MPs suggested that Theresa May should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK would be "out" by now if Mr Farage was the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May in reconciling her deeply divided species has been highlighted by Tory Brexit-pro-cancellation protesters who have joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her plan on track amid the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mr May's Brussels campaign would try to reach a deal despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour supporters to choose between his package and Chaos.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull to get rid of Chequers.
He said that Mr Farage should be appointed as interlocutor and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
This Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.
He described his opposition to the EU as follows: We did not fight in the world wars to be servants now.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.
The meeting was also attended by Andrea Jenkyns, the Tory Brexit supporter, who told the reporters: "I'm simply saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is not popular with our party and our activists who are active in the streets and even lead us to the election.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs Mayev, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given a 'feel of the heat' if they are to deliver on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people and our political class,' he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to say: We will not let you do that.
In a message to the thrilled crowd, he added: 'I want you to give our political class, which is on the verge of brexit, a warm welcome.'
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which has secured us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A handful of activists waved Tory anti-Brexit flags this weekend after the group was formed.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues with the client's app after the conference opened.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can set up the IT systems and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for the no-frills border, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren will be carefully studying her possible run for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be scrutinizing the presidential race after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting of citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's Massachusetts campaign co-chair in 2016.
She's at the center of speculation that she might face Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke Saturday afternoon was her 36th town hall meeting with voters since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to come to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.
Arrest following the death of LSU player Sims in a shooting.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed in the early hours of Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately died", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters, 247sports reported.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson confessed at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-3, 198-pound junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world title, but the team told him to hand the win to Sebastian Vettel
It became clear on Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, that the Mercedes team would have a big impact on the race.
Bottas got off to a good start at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove first into the box and let Hamilton drive on the tail of the traffic, which should have been the deciding factor.
Mercedes drove into the box later and left him behind Vettel, but after some driving action, Hamilton noticed that the Ferrari driver's disfavor left the inside open and risked being left behind after two moves for the third corner defense.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
After that, he drove most of the race without changing his tyres, as he intended to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally took the lead on lap 44, but he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri drove fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
"The team did a really great job to get to first and second", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence on not disclosing a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At the rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are "evil, corrupt and lying".
"The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last few days, that we can see the anger, when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying", he said.
When you look at the press releases and the disclosures, and people say, "No, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you disclose this?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't expose him.
Okay, hold on a second.
We've disclosed it... no, we haven't", he added about the senator's impression.
Ford's letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh was sent in July and leaked to the media in early September, but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose her letter", she told the commission, according to a report in The Hill Feinstein.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked.
But her denial obviously didn't fit the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday night: "I tell you, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his defense of a Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that Democrats are abusing the charges for their own ends.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You've seen the evil, the abomination, they don't care who they hurt and who they have to push to get to power and control", the president said, according to a report on the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants, 5 to 3.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars have made up for their loss in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants with a 5-3 win at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were outscored by two runs in the first inning by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home field, and then Dwyer again took the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lundwald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 from behind on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal of the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 left on Kendall McFaul's assist, Beauvillier scoring four minutes later, and David Rutherford passing.
In the intense opening game, Sullivan led the home side back into the game at 1:10 p.m., and Matt Marquardt handed Cownie the tie at 3:16 p.m.
Dwyer led the Giants into the break, scoring his second goal of the night late in the first quarter.
The home side rallied again, and Bouchard made up for it with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead at the end of the second-third and secure the win with his team's fifth goal of the half and secure the win with his team's fifth goal in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
An air traffic controller's death enabled hundreds of people on board to escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after sacrificing his life to get a plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the ground.
Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami, killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The area continues to be shaken by the strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He remained in it so that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower, thinking he was breaking.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news outlet ABC News reported.
We arranged for a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper reached Pala.
"It breaks our hearts to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's Disaster Mitigation Agency said access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutonga was limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies were found under the rubble and many were unreachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday, has been devastated by waves as high as 20 feet [6 m].
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance is bringing bodies in.
There's a shortage of clean water.
The mini-markets are all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they'll find.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and addressed the national army: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people died in the earthquakes that struck Indonesia in Lombok.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says it is missing one person after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini announced in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The request for more information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality, was not immediately answered.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in a lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"That's extremely good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers managed to break through the belt-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and yelled, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who were repairing a nearby pier also came to the rescue, using an inflatable boat to ferry people to land before the plane sank into some 100 feet [30 m] of water.
The Aviation Safety Network data show that 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented its evidence Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location information from multiple cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night before her death, which contradicts his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was lying because it was [my] truck in Nashville.
The other inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone footage shows that you only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone in the time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the jury would decide the trial later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, claim that hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social commitment.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple for being fired for a racist message
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly-sent message from the mother who complained that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies racist behavior and liken the lawsuit to "blackmail".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when she discovered that her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After finding out about her fall, Plasco-Flaxman, feeling "uncomfortable", fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job and wanted to hire a Filipino, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for a day's work, and then she was sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple in court for $350 a day for six months for doing the work she was originally hired to do, even though she had no contract.
"I want to show them, you know, you don't do that", she told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable because they feared that they would not be able to trust her again after being disappointed.
She sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, " said her husband, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
 Would you be willing to entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on, then.
Comparing the lawsuit to "emigration", Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
You're gonna put up with someone like that?
"That's not very nice", the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media for his behavior and way of thinking.
The authors of the Paddington bear stories feared that readers would not associate with the talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the shoes of someone who has read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's very amusing to hear that now that Paddington has become a huge hit.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, would have been outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that his death last year marked the 60th anniversary of the book greenko-sweetka.
Regarding Paddington Bear, whom she described as "a very important member of our family", she said that my father was very proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet man who didn't like to brag", she said.
But because Paddington Bear was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had accomplished something: You were proud of him, even if you weren't really doing it yourself.
I think Paddington's success was viewed in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always credited the success of the Paddington bear to himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"She called regularly to say that she was really feeling bad, that she didn't expect this to happen", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
And then I got a call from Nad, and he told me that she was gonna die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, Tash, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly swallowed and left her system.
She'd been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a position where I was surrounded by my family and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was undergoing.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head bowed and tears running down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt this intense feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women stick suicide warning signs on a bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge are putting up posters with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, was the one who found his nephew when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that it's going to trigger a domino effect".
Mrs. Davis made posters to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit in silence. You need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who was a friend of Davies' for many years, lost Mark, who was her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was completely on the floor on Christmas Day, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything.
She said that his death was a severe trauma to them, but they had to rework it: It had carved a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
But we have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI investigates the case.
"I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for, given the length and scope of the limited investigation, it might be a surprise", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would collapse because of the entrenched party stalemate.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time frame in which the investigation would have taken place.
With only five weeks to go until the midterm elections on November 6th, if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, it will weaken them greatly in their attempt to elect the man they want to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush made several phone calls to senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by Mr. Bush to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, is about to take a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can garner at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence a breakthrough from the bench and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said that 1,127 people crossed the border last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the price increases demanded by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not yet commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the flags of denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on the overall goal of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the slowdown since then.
"Without the confidence of the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm", Mr Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "historical" and said he is characteristically unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of anything other than a woman who behaves like this would be labelled 'historical,'" Pelosi commented on Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and choking while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated smear campaign" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh's testimony proved he should not be nominated for the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased toward Democrats.
"I think he's discredited himself with statements like this and the way he's dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi, when asked if she'd try to press charges against Kavanaugh if he was confirmed and the Democrats won a majority in the House, became, for a moment,
"I'm going to say this: If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's unfit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's sitting in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a federal appeals court judge in Washington.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, she's concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because she's considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided asking whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful?'", Pelosi said.
And the woman has to be hoisted.
It's a just fall, after months and years of anger, and he can't express it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", she called me 45 years later, Mrs. Stein.
It doesn't seem so rare to me, does it?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere, who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, which is when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was great.
Tears are partly permissible as an outlet for anger because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories of my early career working in a male-dominated office, one time finding myself crying in unspeakable rage, was when I was grabbed by an older woman -- a cold leader who I had always been a little afraid of -- who dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she said.
They won't understand that you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they beat you up.
Patricia Schroeder, former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over the fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to drop out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder found in deep despair that there was no reason why she couldn't run for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race, and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
As the last to join the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the contest unless she raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given the men $1,000, had only given her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in the interview that she would not be running for office, her feelings of gratitude to the people who supported her, her dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and her anger at sexism, all overwhelmed her to the point of suffocation.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schroeder recalled the media reaction.
You'd think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my headstone.
Did she cry?
How a U.S.-China war could benefit Beijing
The initial rumblings of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is not over yet, experts say that the rift between the two nations could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated with equivalent retaliatory measures each time, most recently with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world's second largest economy, has pledged to keep an eye on the United States, and it's not likely to blink any time soon.
For Washington to relent, China would have to agree to his demands, but the public removal of the US for Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing can make the right moves, U.S. pressure in the trade war could have a long-term positive effect on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The possibility that a hasty policy decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that trigger an economic shock in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security's think tank.
Syria is "ready" to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the fight against terrorism has made the situation on the ground more stable and safer", he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
He stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six straight on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won the crown again, with Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scoring the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled through most of the championship, threw the ball into the water on his opening shot on the 16th hole of the par-3 game, forcing him to hand the game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled through all the rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth won 5-4 over the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in the Ryder Cup for the last time.
Eight-time Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't help myself today.
This year has been hard.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for raising me and believing in me.
So happy, so happy that we won the cup again.
"It's about the team and I'm really happy that I was able to help", Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He hands the relay to compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, who I watched play when I was growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup, 13-21-3.
That's an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has been working very hard all week to find the right course, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who have been playing high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
The American captain said after a bad performance for his team, "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought".
We put a little bit of pressure on Europe this morning.
We missed it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players were playing very well.
We're gonna have to regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we're gonna move on.
I really like these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
- Take your hat off.
They've outplayed us.
Red tide news: Concentrations are decreasing off the coast of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratoga counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
The FWC reported more dispersed blooms in the Pinellas, Manatee, Saratoza, Charlotte and Collier Counties, indicating a reduction in concentrations.
The red tide extends about 130 miles from the coast of northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
The patches are visible about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
Red tide has also been spotted in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations were reported in Pinellas County and its shores, low to high concentrations along the Hillsborough County coast, baseline to high concentrations in Manatee County, baseline to high concentrations in Saratoga County and its shores, baseline to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, baseline to high concentrations in Lee County and its shores, and low concentrations in Collier County last week.
Breathing disturbances continue to be reported from Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory distress has been reported in the past week from Northwest Florida.
