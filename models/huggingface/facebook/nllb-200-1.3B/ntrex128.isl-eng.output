Welsh councillors are worried about looking like a flower
Some councillors are upset about the proposal to change their titles to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The concerns have been raised by a plan to change the name of the council to the Welsh Assembly.
Councillors from all parties are concerned that this could lead to a vote.
One Labour councillor said his party was concerned that it was "rhythmically" Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means sour.
A Plaid Cymru councillor said the party as a whole was "displeased" and had made other suggestions for the party.
A Welsh Conservative councillor said his party had considered the name change, but pointed out that there was little difference between the term MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be noted that the letter w is borrowed similarly to u in Icelandic.
The Council, which is currently working on a bill to propose the name changes, said: "The final decision on any title held by the members of the Council will of course be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Council published the results of a public opinion poll which showed strong support for calling the Council the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of councillors, the council chose the WMP (Welsh Parliament members), but the MWP received the most public support in the opinion polls.
According to reports, council members are now making other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement with council president Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft of the changes within a few weeks.
The reform package will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the recruitment of councillors and the organisation of the committee system.
Members will be able to vote on their title at the start of the debate on the draft.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
This issue was put to a vote in an attempt to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that its neighbours in the north have equal rights to its territory and has repeatedly opposed their applications for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the referendum on the name change, has said he will not consider the election valid.
However, supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The church bells of St. Martin's sound is churches in Harlem have trouble
"The elders I spoke to said that in the past you had to find a bar and a church on every street corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither is there.
He said that it was understandable that the number of children was declining.
"People have other ways of meeting these days", he said.
"Bars are no longer the focal points of the neighborhood, where people regularly gather".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money raised from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders expect and that sooner or later they will be back on track.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings that are full of people who will not help to save the remaining neighborhood's garbage.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he said, "and will therefore hasten the closure of these churches completely, because it is unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a center of black settlement - the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved abroad in the 1940's.
The congregations of Telakis who had been working in the area took over the building.
The Congregation of the Twelve took over St. Martin's Church under the leadership of Sir John Howard Johnson, who had initiated the tying of the shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, which were forced to hire Twelve workers or give them promotions.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but members of the Johnson Congregation made plans to rebuild it and had the bell tower built.
Sir David Johnson, son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the clockwork the proud "clockwork of the poor people".
The expert who played the clock in July called it another name: "Cultural Fund" and "A unique historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not gotten anyone else to replace him.
In recent months, numerous architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others by the diocese.
The church council - which oversees the project and is appointed by church leaders - wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was seeking to pass the cost on to the church council, even though it had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some attackers complained of a lack of response from the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy who was eating lobster is injured by a shark in California
According to authorities, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while hunting for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been caving with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then crossed over with a group of others to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just the thrill of catching a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
All traces of him were torn up, Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
"There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is critically injured.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Coast Guard Chief Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed the beach entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security reasons.
Giles said that there are over 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to take the UK's cosmetics market by storm
Sainsbury's is set to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a shopping centre-style cosmetics range and a trained support staff.
The larger beauty products will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and will be installed in more stores next year if successful.
Investments in cosmetics are part of a way for supermarkets to use the space previously used for televisions, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's says it plans to double its cosmetics range to a total of 3,000 products, including brands on board with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The store is also planning to re-launch its boutique line of snacks, with the majority of products being vegan-friendly, but with a higher demand for younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test-drive its stores in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, south London, last week and the next opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
E-commerce and the growing tendency for consumers to buy small amounts of food daily from neighborhood stores means that supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores would be more like shopping malls as the chain tries to fight the low-priced Aldi and Lidl stores with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat stores since the two chains were purchased two years ago, which they say has increased sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The store's earlier attempt to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals divisions failed.
Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots around 2000, but ended up having a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of the drugs in supermarkets.
The new policy follows the sale of Sainsbury's' 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Under the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a large range of luxury leather brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, marketing director at Sainsbury's, said: 'We have changed the look of our cosmetics wheels to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specific training for staff who will be available for consultation.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs.  A healthy environment and convenient location make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old business practices.
Peter Jones is a talented after Holly Willoughby quits an £11 million contract
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den, became a sensation after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million contract with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home improvement brand, Truly.
The company had been likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
Willoughby, 37, a former This Morning star, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones with a painful ending by quitting a popular lifestyle company at the last minute to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was caught up in a tough meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, when the TV personality admitted she did not have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly due to new deals worth up to £1.5 million.
The company has been compared to Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's brand, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to retire from Truly, Jones flew from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source told the AP that "Truly" was on Holly's priority list.
This was to be her future career, which would provide her with income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was a complete shock to everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line was going to market.
There's a stockpile of products at Marlow's headquarters ready to go on sale.
Experts believe that the breach of the This Morning advert, which is among Britain's most popular stars, could cost the company millions in heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and baskets to clothing and household goods, and potentially add to the loss of sales.
It could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Torah Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summers together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television production company.
Willoughby will be the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of the ITV series I'm a Celebrity.
A confidential informant, Mr Jones, said last night: "We don't want to say anything about his business".
♪ We had a tough conversation ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He has defied the criticism he has received from the media for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for a president, and for being so positive about the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given so much away?
Said Trump, and he responded to a reporter's voice.
I've left nothing behind.
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, talks on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean Ambassador Ri Yong Ho told international delegates at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not given an "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's first steps toward denuclearization.
He said that instead, the United States continued to hold on to its business partners in order to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more positive in his speech.
"We're very happy to be with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would have lost their lives.
We're in a great relationship now.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - missile tests have been stopped, hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also maintained an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, there were only 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause extensive damage to island, hundreds dead
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, international relief organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, a state of emergency was not declared, but international organizations can be expected to launch relief efforts there.
"In many cases, they have unfortunately made it clear that they will not ask for international assistance, so this is difficult", Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear when foreign aid workers will be able to start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country's relief agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see whether international aid should be allowed.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is woefully ill-prepared to cope with natural disasters.
Although flood guards have been built in Aceh, they are rare on other coastlines.
So it seems that the irradiation of the flood defences in Palu has increased the number of casualties even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling between the many islands of Indonesia can be challenging.
Natural disasters make planning even more difficult.
An ambulance that has been docked at the port of Lombok to care for earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new site.
President Joko Widodo has made it a priority of his election campaign to repair Indonesia's degraded transportation systems and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued Mr. Joko's government, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also has to deal with ongoing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative religious stance.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal. His team was down 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to score a goal towards the goalpost.
The ball flew high over the line and into the right corner of it.
The ball eventually went over the top of the net.
"I just wanted to try and get in that position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far as possible so I tried to make as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and touch once and didn't think much of it, just took the shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 up in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the attack, the Chelsea striker passed the ball with a heel to Mateo Kovacic and then jumped from the centre over to Liverpool's helmet.
Kovacic made the ball go fast in the middle.
Then he passed the ball gracefully and sent Hazard in for a field goal.
Hazard evaded the defenders and scored in the corner with a left-footed shot past Alisson Becker, Liverpool's goalkeeper.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the League Cup qualifiers at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
Death toll from flooding in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the organization, told a news conference that a number of people were buried when buildings collapsed in Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which caused waves of up to 20 feet [6 m] in height.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered in rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with a stab wound was found at 7:55 a.m. this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they see or hear anything.
Brian O'Hagan, the investigating officer, said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something with their car cameras to contact us, as they may be able to provide important information for our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside an apartment.
Earlier today, people who claimed to know the woman came to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are working to notify the victim's next of kin.
A bus driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may pass before they can return.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area now appears to be a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She keeps saying, "This is so horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were inside the marked police area and one car was just outside.
A large number of police officers stood within the marked area, watching the residential buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Global Line anonymously on 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 as of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament is the latest monument accused of "rewriting history".
The banning of the statue would be poetic justification for the Taliban's destruction of its fanatical Puritan followers on so many cultural and religious heirs of England.
The Cromwell Society, however, said that Mr. Crick's proposal was "phased" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be put to the test.
The end of the English Civil War against the Cultural Monument was neither the order nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell would have been wrongly sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a sign of the spirit of the 19th century and is part of the story of a man whom many still consider to be unworthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, as having been the protector of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case the royal power.
Whether this description is entirely accurate is still a matter of great historical debate.
However, it is certain that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known figure who represents one side of those conflicts.
His work as a protector of the state deserves to be honored and remembered.
Pig attacks and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a Chinese farmer at a market in southwest China, according to local reports.
The man, known only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a blunt-force trauma and covered in blood near a stake in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to reports from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccine into pigs in a pig pen on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his uncle from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and found the door to a pigsty open.
He said that inside the trail there had been a large rabbit with a bloody mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-pound slug killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were bloody and wounded", the uncle, nicknamed Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The owner of the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it would not attack anyone else while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market's owners are in talks to compensate for his loss.
There are recorded instances of pigs attacking humans, though this is rare.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig in their Massachusetts home, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had been clinging to a well-to-do tractor until his wife caught the animal off guard.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that blood transfusions can induce aggression in them.
They're just playing.
They're eager to see and they're curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
"You just have to show them the respect they deserve", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rose are causing severe damage to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it passes over a sandy bay off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring with it a large amount of damage that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 135 miles per hour at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, located about 300 miles [600 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is scheduled to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean and will head east toward the U.S. West Coast, with Rosa's arrival on Monday at the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm to be followed by a major tropical storm heading northward into the southwestern United States.
Rose will follow with up to 25 centimeters of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical storm will mix with the approaching lowland, creating a large and widespread impact over the southwest in the coming days.
Local waste of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of the soil and possible landslides in the desert.
A severe heat wave will produce up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to three inches [5-10 cm] of precipitation is expected in some areas of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
The possibility of flash floods with short-lived conditions is due to the distribution of tropical rainfall.
People are strongly advised against going out into the desert on foot when there is a threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can quickly turn the tide into torrential rains, and thunderstorms have brought with them thunderstorms and thunderstorms.
The approaching storm will bring localized precipitation to certain areas along the Southern California coastline.
There's a chance of a little bit of debris, which could cause a slight movement of the ground and a bump in the road.
This is the first rainfall in the region.
Several distributed tropical storms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before spreading to larger areas late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across four states on Tuesday and end on Wednesday.
The Arctic is expected to cool, but the temperature is likely to remain moderately warm throughout the United States.
Sometimes this can cause large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A prime example of extreme heat in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the current summer storm will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures of about 85 degrees Fahrenheit [25°C] or more from the plains in the south to the northeastern states.
Temperatures could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, about 6 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates that there is a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.
More than 20 million people watched the stirring testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault alleged to have occurred in the 1990s, broadcast on six different networks.
Meanwhile, political turmoil continued, and television stations paused their regular newscasts for Friday's breaking news: Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona introduced a bill that would allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was convinced that Kavanaugh had drunkenly assaulted her and tried to undress her at a school party.
In an emotional statement, Kavanaugh said he was confident that it had not happened.
The number of people who watched the trial is likely to exceed the 20.4 million that Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company measured the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other television networks that aired the interviews, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also usually has trouble measuring people's attitudes toward offices.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size to a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, the most viewed day-long auditions were on Fox News Channel, with 5.69 million viewers, and the show's reviewers have been very supportive of Kavanaugh's nomination.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest continued after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's game.
After the Republican congressman's office announced that he would vote Kavanaugh in, CNN and CBS cameramen obtained footage of him as protesters called on him Friday morning, trying to get into an elevator to attend a meeting of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood there, depressed for a few minutes, while he was overwhelmed by shame on CNN's live feed.
One woman said, "I'm standing right in front of you".
Do you think he's telling the truth to his countrymen?
The people said to him, "You have power, and so many women are holding power".
Flake said his office issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed, he said he would speak further at the committee meeting.
The cable and television networks were all live later as the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to move Kavanaugh's nomination forward to the Senate election.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards.
Flake's vote was a disaster because it was clear that the Republicans didn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics with Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of being "a political game" about Britain's future and undermining its interests.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published alongside her front-page interview, Boris Johnson, her former foreign secretary, blamed the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should each withdraw tariffs was "totally unfair".
Police arrested Dyteon Simpson in connection with the LSU football player's death
Police have arrested one suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The authorities released video footage of Sims and Simpson fighting, and said Sims lost his glasses in the rapids.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's genetic material on them, according to WAFB, CBS' sister network.
Police say Simpson confessed to questioning that he shot and killed Wayde.
According to his lawyer, a $350,000 insurance policy was in place.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner's office issued a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and down the neck.
Authorities would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Special Branch, the Criminal Investigation Division of the Louisiana State Police, the Southern University Police Department and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked law enforcement for their "consideration" and sought justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-7 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played baseball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "sadly disappointed" and "shocked" by Wayde's facial expression.
"It's something you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcanoes are blowing up Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased dramatically, with 183 cases of gas and smoke releases recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center was watching the tremors and tremors from the volcano.
Images on social media showed a thin layer of noise on the wheels of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geologists have been observing increased activity in the volcano, which is 45 miles [72 km] southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists right before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters stormed riot police and thousands took part in protests marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's controversial independence vote.
Groups of masked separatists roasted eggs on riot police and threw powdered paint that formed a dark cloud of dust on the streets, which were usually crowded with tourists.
Attacks also broke out later that day, and police used batons to keep the rioters in line.
The separatist factions shouted: "We will not forget and we will not forgive" for several hours while their opponents shouted back: "Long live Spain".
Fourteen were subjected to minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
High tensions continue in the autonomous region one year after the referendum of 1 October was declared illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, but turnout was low as most of those opposed to secession ignored the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations across the region, but this led to ongoing clashes.
Independent groups had stayed out all night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the country's police.
The protest went ahead but was forced to go the other way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, joined his wife in the separatist protests, saying that he was no longer afraid of Catalonia's independence.
Last time we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite winning a necessary but modest victory in regional elections in December, Catalonia's independence parties have struggled to hold their own this year, with many of their most prominent leaders either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protests on her phone, said that politicians in both states had encouraged the dispute.
"The tension is growing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison and awaiting trial since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
'My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen the Spanish government apply,' he said.
Londonderry: People arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7.30pm UK time.
Bob Blemmings, the investigator, said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It's also possible that the bullet was fired from a crossbow towards the vehicle.
The score was 1-0 in Livingston's win over Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the victory for Livingston
Livingston's relegation to the lower leagues saw Rangers in the open and Steven Gerrard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Mark Dolly Menga made the cut and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have yet to win a Premier League outfield game this season and will play Hearts, who are eight points ahead of the top-ranked side, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is still undefeated in the league with six wins, and Holt head coach has yet to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wasted his chances on a biting visitor
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored, but their bone shooting caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but faltered in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot forward after running through the defence to take a scalpel delivery from Graig Halkett across the goal line.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in a calm manner, knowing that they could cause trouble for the guests in the right places.
And that's how the big score was scored.
Rangers were given a bonus point and Livingston worked to create a scoreboard, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson helping Menga, who took over the transmission, to score from midfield.
At that point, the Rangers had the ball but the home defense was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper, didn't have to put much effort into it.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot from a goal after an attack from Livingston.
The points were consistently in Livingston's line of scrimmage but were kicked off, and two points were awarded for the points - after Halkett's defense against alternate Glenn Middleton, and one after hand - were dismissed.
"Happy at Livingston" - the analysis
Alasdair Lamont, the BBC Scotland correspondent at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A brilliant performance and a great result for Livingston.
To the average person, they stood out and went on to surpass all expectations of their success.
Their style of play and the team have hardly changed since their return to the top flight, but Holt is highly praised for having put the team together since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the captain, was extremely good and led a full-fledged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes all the time.
The Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As good as they've been under Gerrard, they've fared far short of expectations.
They were unsuccessful in their quest and only managed to open a local's pitch once, so this should be a wake-up call for Rangers, who are now in the middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The skies were bright and smiling on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
They have been at odds over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
Police used security measures to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but large numbers of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also joined in condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The two groups of critics reflect the controversial nature of this visitor, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics responded, but the man died at the scene.
The accident came a few months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Police said they were working to identify the man and let his closest associates know.
Road closures and buses are being re-routed, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six men injured in the attack
Six prison guards were injured when rioters broke into a maximum-security men's prison, according to a report from the Bureau of Prisons.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30am UK time on Sunday and are still raging.
Tornado Special Forces have been called to the area to try to contain the unrest, which has affected eight inmates, and is confined to one wing of the prison.
The guards were discharged with minor facial injuries on the scene.
A spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said: "Special guards have been called in to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six employees have been placed on injured reserve.
No violence has taken place in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could expect to spend even more time behind bars.
Over 500 prisoners are held at Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden had been hospitalized after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And last October, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious breach of the peace, where employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (dry areas could benefit)
Tropical storms are rare in Arizona, but they are likely to occur early next week when the remnants of Cyclone Rose move over the southwest, threatening flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southwestern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is scheduled to leave for Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with a final report.
The Phoenix Meteorological Office said on Twitter that since 1950 only 20 hurricanes have sustained strength enough to be classified as tropical storms or storms within 200 miles [300 km] of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64 km) of the Arizona border.
The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center predicts 5-10 cm of debris, with a plume of debris up to 15 cm at Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and The Great Basin, are likely to produce 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with the possibility of single precipitation of up to 10 cm.
For those not at risk of flash floods, the Rose's result could be a blessing, since the area is experiencing severe droughts.
While flooding may cause great damage, some of this will have a positive effect, as drought is now in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Department of Drought, at least 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, but that is the second-highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa was still classified as a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h (49 mph) and is 620 km (400 mi) south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, traveling northward at 19 km/h (19 mph).
The storm passes over the shallow Pacific Ocean, diminishing its power.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or Monday evening.
There is a high risk of flooding in some areas of Mexico.
"There is a potential for up to 7.5 to 15 centimeters of precipitation in Baja California and into northwest Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 centimeters of precipitation", weather.com reported.
Rose will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm, reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical storm, then continue up through Arizona and reach southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very severe damage in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert region of the United States", said the National Hurricane Center.
Expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and land movement in the deserts, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 0400 hours UK time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in a nightclub in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Police have asked witnesses who may have phone records of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been "incensed" by the anger and malice of the Democratic Party
"A vote in favor of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in opposition to the ruthless and corrupt practices of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally of supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had been "conscious of the anger and malice" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that the people of the United States had seen Kavanaugh's genius and manhood and courage the other day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most brilliant lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant record as a public servant", he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters' participation in the midterm elections.
It's five weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not offering, but I'm doing it anyway, he said.
That's why I'm going around the field to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats were working to "defend and prevent".
The first key vote on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to the Republican vice chairman in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and flood in Indonesia, death toll likely to rise
At least 384 people were killed and many more were washed away in a massive tsunami on the coast of Sulawesi, Indonesia, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the island, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu on Friday when a 20-foot-high (6-meter-high) beach shaft at sunset swept the crowd into the sea, destroying everything in their path.
The wave was formed by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami formed yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it killed", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's tsunami agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The flood did not come alone, it swept away cars, tree drums, houses, it shelled everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the flood wave had traveled over the open ocean at a speed of 500 miles [800 km] before it shelled the shore.
Some climbed trees to escape the floodwaters and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Weather Service showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and unused bridges, and mosques surrounding the water.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Institute of Food and Technology said in a statement that the energy released by the landslide in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic location, which lies at the end of a long, meandering stream, may have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "serious" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found trapped under rubble in collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and property damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala which is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications are down and no sign of Donggala, said Nugroho.
"Over 300,000 people live there", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", the Red Cross said.
The organization was criticized by many on Saturday for not reporting that a flood had hit Palu, although officials said the storm had arrived within the time the warning was issued.
A video posted on social media showed a man shouting from the top of a building to warn people on the street below of an approaching flood.
In a matter of minutes, the tidal wave hits the shore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and flood caused a power outage that disrupted communications in Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to organize relief efforts.
The military has begun sending planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, according to officials, but people who have been helped by the area are still in desperate need of food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only recently been reopened for relief work and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president is going to visit the refugee camps in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia's flood waters is now over 800.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision personnel from Donggala have reached Palu City, where they are seeking shelter in tent cities set up in the park outside their offices, and were hit by artillery fire en route, according to Mr. Doseba.
"People said they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid teams have begun a difficult relief effort, but some have complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers are being discouraged from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies, and personnel can only begin to come if the disaster area is declared a disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
"This is still a localised disaster area", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared it a desert area, we can open up for foreign aid, but no declaration has come yet.
As the second night fell over Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the still missing hoped that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that cast hope on the fulfillment of the promises that follow natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a tree.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian volleyball team, had been the coach of two now-missing volleyball players for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others locked up inside the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
"As a man with a long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that within hours of news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse reaching the same flight crew, he sent a WhatsApp message of desperation to the contestants staying in Palu and attending the beach party.
His message, however, was only a sad sign, not a blue one.
"I think it means the messages weren't received", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a gas station in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink's employee, who was filling a fast-food restaurant in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver of the car had been cheating at the amusement park and was about to fill it with more money, said Dennis McCarthy, a police commissioner, in the statement.
While he was at work, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a purse that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but police did not say how many were alerted.
Anyone with information on the suspects is requested to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "Veran who was formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ariana Grandi in the series, but she left for "emotional reasons", the show's producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
"I think that you is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you", West said earlier this year when discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- just being a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the messy, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, West's former partner, has also written his name both with and without his belt and his hat.
Mexico's president-elect says he won't use the military against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, president-elect of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country soon marks the 50th anniversary of the bloodiest student uprising.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador vowed never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in a public square, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root throughout Romanian America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly stipend and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of academic skills draw young people into criminal organizations.
The United States should double its spending on artificial intelligence
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this area, says AI inventor and user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
The reports came after various departments of the U.S. government issued reports of satellite activity, even though the United States has no official comprehensive satellite program.
However, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the world's leader in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the money going into AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we're waiting to see the next big discovery in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of the next big artificial intelligence discovery being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the largest artificial intelligence firms in China.
He worked on artificial intelligence systems in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, winning the U.S. Player of the Year in Othello, and later was CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese division at Google.
Lee spoke of previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to get a look at the next innovators.
Scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that likes the main idea, it's the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have been hiring talent from universities to work on artificial intelligence for the past few years.
Lee said that changes to immigration policy could also help the United States strengthen its artificial intelligence research.
'I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should be granted automatic residence permits,' he said.
The Chinese parliament published its Future Artificial Intelligence Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Academy of Sciences provides funding to people working at universities, similar to what the National Science Foundation and similar government agencies do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a satellite intelligence center, designed to work with both industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of a special commission on satellite intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation designed to create a security council for artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its neighbours in the north claim the same name as it does on its territory and therefore denies it membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will erase the identity of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
President Gyorge Ivanov has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore it has raised doubts that turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: 'Do you want to join NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a fair price for Macedonia to join alliances like the EU and NATO, which was one of the countries formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
'I came here today to vote for the future of the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While the result is not legally binding, enough lawmakers have said they will pursue it and make it law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.
The Election Commission said that no unusual events had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica, and their son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the country's name, which would pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, worked to prepare a small stage and set up benches in front of tents that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
"We are loyal to NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not go through the service door", Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we live above dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO will move the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
'I think a large majority will agree that over 80 percent of the country is committed to the EU and NATO,' Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that acceptance would be the key to our future.
A poll released Monday by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, but that's below the required minimum.
Another poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of those polled planned to cast their ballots on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would.
For the referendum to be valid, a vote must be 50 percent plus one.
If the vote is not passed, it could mark the first serious blow to the policy of the Western-backed government since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through all the defenses of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took the defence of Brighton lightly in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a broadcast in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
He blew past three Brighton defenders and then went out into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He overtook one defender and then overtook several more just before the Brighton goal.
Then he turned left and found Sterling.
The English striker used the first touch within the wicket to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play on Mathew Ryan, Brighton's goalkeeper, with a shot to the right of the field.
"Aguero is in some kind of foot trouble", Pep Guardiola, City's chief executive, told reporters.
We talked about him playing for 55, 60 minutes.
Then this happened.
We were lucky he scored at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Blues their first goal in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a broadcast deep inside the Brighton helmets in that attack.
He sent a beautiful long ball to the left for Leroy Sane.
Sane kicked the ball a few times and then sent Sterling towards the quarterback.
City's forward sent the ball into the net just before it ran out.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a playoff game against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was little reason to push for a second start.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to get a pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to make the playoffs, but they're one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division.
The Rockies at least earned a wildcard spot with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still looking to win its first division title.
Even if we play for free, at least we can play in the electrified atmosphere of Denver, and the rest of the team will surely be playing their best game of the year.
Why should I not want to compete in such a situation?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher for Sunday's game, but it's believed they let Scherzer pitch under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who was starting his 34th game, took the practice lottery on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is usually his day off.
This right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to visit West Virginia
The president made a direct reference to the case surrounding Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters getting involved in the midterm elections.
It's all on the table in November.
It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are some of the big, big... I don't run, but I do, so I'm going all over the field to fight for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, radical bunch of Democrats, you can see it happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means necessary, you see the cruelty, the malice.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to go over to get power and control, they just want power and control, we don't give it to them.
He said the Democrats were working to "defend and prevent".
And it's been the last four days, he said, calling Democrats crazy and evil and cruel and unreasonable.
He named Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was met with a roar from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you seal the document?
Ha, what.
No, look, no, I waited for one... it was really bad physical torture, the worst I've ever seen.
The working class is no longer a moderate church.
He Does Not Tolerate Anyone Who Expresses His Thoughts
When the Momentum activist in my party chose to give me a compliment, it was hardly surprising.
I am, after all, the last of many Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome, just for expressing our views.
Joan Ryan, my fellow congresswoman, received similar treatment because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the suggestion to give me a reprimand was made because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were the importance of having a responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, a coldly similar issue that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that 'we want the meetings to be non-interference and productive.'
In my eight years as a Labour MP, Friday meetings have always been exactly that.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of a milder and better government has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not shared within the Labour Party and that all views are judged by whether the party leaders consider them to be plausible.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I thought had similar political views to me, began to expect me to take a complete turn and adopt views that I had never previously agreed with, whether it was national security or the EU's single market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I say - I get a bunch of social media scandals calling for my dissent, denial of my centristism and being told I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, since most of the comments I get are usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those who have to endure a barrage of sexual or prejudicial insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political era is the extent to which assaults and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should maintain a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a moderate church, and with every motion of censure or change in electoral rules, the party is narrowed down.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last two years about not carrying too much, not carrying too much, and then I'd be fine.
But I did not decide to get involved in politics to do so.
Since I became a Labour Party student 32 years ago, spurred on by the neglect of the Thatcher government which left my school classroom in decline, I have fought for better public services for those who need it most, whether I was on the city council or in parliament.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can have any doubts about my policies and where I disagree with the current leadership.
For those of us who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that as the country heads towards Brexit, which will hurt our homes, businesses and public services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But my only message, which I want to send, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are Labour members or not: I serve you with pride, and I promise that no threat of resignation or political retreat will deter me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr team goes to the top
Two late goals could have put the final score in a bit, but there's no doubt that Ayr had the upper hand in this decisive game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the list and the only team in the top ten that's still undefeated.
In the end it was their stronger defence and better use of opportunities that made the home side the victors and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've had some tough opposition in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "They deserve credit, they've used their opportunity better than we have".
Mark Grant Anderson came over in the 14th minute after Frazier Climo returned the attack, but a yellow card on the Scottish forward, who was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo added to Ayr's lead with a wicket before scoring on a kick just before half-time and then a touchdown to bring Ayr over 17-5 in the half.
But the Melrose started the second half strong and Patrick Anderson's touchdown, after Baggot returned the attack, reduced the scoring to five points.
Gera then needed a long period of play to deal with serious injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off the pitch, and after that Ayr further extended their lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo returned the attack.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given the yellow jersey and Melrose again used his man-over-man touchdown from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a tough attack.
However, the home side came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded the yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's attack, after extra time.
Climo returned to the attack, as he did again immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick from the wicket and sent it to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Star of the Still Game show ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, star of the hit show Still Game, seems poised to make the transition to restaurant business after it emerged he was hired as CEO of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC sitcom, which he writes and stars in alongside his longtime entertainment partner, Creg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be its last, and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's life.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, but the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan wanted to become involved in the "living restaurant industry" of Glasgow.
"The ocean is ours": The coastal country of Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The Marines are guarding the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings are flagged with blue flags.
Floating stations from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it.
But throughout the rest of landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline, lost to Chile in bloody 19th-century fighting, is still fresh in my mind - along with the desire to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes may be the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of litigation.
"Bolivia is full of strength, unity and dignity, and of course it is waiting for the decision with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice's ruling on a large scale throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia on their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access after decades of difficult negotiations.
Monday's ruling is also very important for Evo Morales, the president of the Indian nation who will face a controversial re-election campaign next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some commentators feel that the court's decision in favor of Bolivia is unlikely, and that it would make little difference if it did.
The court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to grant land from Chile and has ruled that the decision will not affect the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's decision comes just six months after the final hearing suggests that the case "was not complicated", said Paz Sárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
It is also possible that the past four years have not been a matter of Bolivia's progress, but have caused the country to regress.
"The current government of Bolivia has stepped in to address the issue of access to the sea", Zarate said.
She said that Morales' military rhetoric had taken away all goodwill from Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, former president of Bolivia and his country's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision took an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a unique opportunity to open a new relationship with Chile and an opportunity to end a conflict that goes back 139 years, to the benefit of both countries, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of the most popular presidents in Romanian America, was using the issue as a political leverage.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to make amends for the past.
North Korea says it will not denuclearize unless the United States can rely on it
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the country will never first dismantle its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri gave his speech Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the promises made at the Singapore Summit of World Leaders.
His reference now is US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be reopening talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "dream" to think that the continued trade embargo and U.S. opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington will not accept the declaration unless Pyongyang takes concrete steps to denuclearize first.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, want to meet again at another meeting.
However, there are serious doubts that Pyongyang is serious about disarming, which it likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris fashion shows present the latest line of large-size headwear that will be available in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showcased a variety of oversized, streamlined hats for their SS19 line at the fashion show that celebrated the hat team at Paris Fashion Week.
Numerous photos of the most unconventional cats have been posted on Instagram this summer, and these designers have had their innovative creations displayed at fashion shows.
Valentino's main work was a large light brown hat with wide loads that resembled feathers and covered the heads of the models.
Other larger objects included watermelons set with gemstones, a seagull's hat, and even pineapples, but these objects are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a number of strange masks, just in time for the horror genre.
Many of the colorful masks had folded sleeves and were more like Hannibal Lecter than festive.
One mask resembled a breathing apparatus with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other resembled melting bread-shaped ice cream.
If you want to be in fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats may soon be on sale in your local fashion store.
Large hats are on display at the La Bomba, a 200-inch-long (over 60 cm) hat that has graced heads from the Rihonn to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion behind the highly unlikely hat, which was seen all over social media, was the inspiration for another large companion piece that appeared on the fashion section  a beach bag made of half that was almost the same size as the bathing suit model who wore it.
The orange-colored strata, with stripes and white clay handles, was the main feature of the La Riviera SS10 Jacquemus fashion show at Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the famous fashion designer, told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach tops in fashion stores next summer - with the designer having made such an impact, it should be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland are known for the outstanding achievements of their pupils and this has continued in 2018 with new, elegant test scores, further enhanced by individual and group approaches in sports, the arts, music and other community areas.
These schools, with up to 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and they strive to provide their pupils and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career paths and their status as global citizens.
As a teaching tool that can compile and teach by customized curriculum, we see that new subjects continue to be popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, it will touch his heart.
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest percentage of students passing tests in private schools.
68 percent of students who studied a foreign language scored A.
The data, collected from 74 schools within SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-level in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved an A-level.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
At the moment, selected languages are placed on a par with science-intensive subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for difficulty in hiring were lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, this skill is essential in a world of limited resources.
Whatever career paths people choose, learning another language will make a real difference in the future, but it is a lifelong knowledge.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will give a person of many weights an automatic advantage over his competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by two-letter pronouns, or 15 percent.
That is why it is important for children today to invest early in language learning.
Multiplication, especially in emerging markets, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language taught varies from school to school.
A number of schools will focus on more classical subjects, while others will teach languages considered to be of most importance to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child's interests lie, he will always be able to choose from the languages in private schools with trained teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
There is no denying that at this time, in a globalised business environment, languages continue to be essential for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be seen as a "global knowledge in communication".
Private schools will continue to offer choice, diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
I must be fine.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is playing his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the Lakers' head coach, has announced that James will play Sunday in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be longer than one minute and shorter than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Mike Trudell, a Lakers reporter, tweeted that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule before the start of the season.
"At this stage in my career, I don't have to play pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Timings for the Trump campaign in West Virginia and YouTube trail
President Donald Trump will hold a series of campaign rallies, the first of which is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly locations, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court on hold, Trump is aiming to build support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the November vote is held.
What time is the Trump campaign in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online via YouTube live below.
Trump presumably presided over the trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been strained by sexual assault allegations.
But the main purpose of Trump's meetings is to help the Republicans get better as they face a tough election in November.
So the message from the Trump campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, are aimed at "filing volunteers and supporters with the fireworks Republicans are trying to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and in Congress", according to Reuters news agency.
"Control of Congress is so essential to the president's agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible as a separate campaign begins", an unnamed Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's meeting will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling, and is expected to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, with coverage from the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's meeting will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this month, after winning by over 40 percent in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican nominee for the Senate from West Virginia, but he's down in the polls.
"It's not good news for Morrissey that the president has to come and try to boost his popularity", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the will to keep hope alive for Sunday's individual competition
After three one-off rounds, the four-game series on Saturday afternoon could be just what was needed in this Ryder Cup race.
The fluctuation in success is an athletic concept that has been invented and that players believe so strongly in, and never more so than in a competition like this.
Where would they say success lies now?
"They were six points ahead and now it's four points, so success is more on our side now, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he started the day's race.
Europe is, of course, in the lead, four points ahead with 12 more in the lead.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel like they have a little bit of wind in their sails and they can be very confident about a lot of things, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each got three points out of four.
Spieth has played a great role in the fight against racism and led by example.
The crowd increased as he headed to the ring and he put down an important cushion to keep all four points of the game after he and Thomas had been two points down after two games.
His puck, which guaranteed them victory in the game on the 15th hole, received a similar cheer, a shout of the kind that tells you that he believes the American team still has a chance of winning.
"One must just dig deep and think about one's own game", said Spieth.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn a point.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but exciting European couple has won four games out of four and can do no wrong.
The only couple who got a Saturday afternoon class were the Moliwoods, but they also avoided school on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the nine-hole course on Friday morning.
The game and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd clearly shows that they are the pair that needs to win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to seal a possible victory for a European team than Fleetwood or Molinari, when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
The best bet is that they both do it at the same time, in different holes.
It is too early to talk about a European team winning, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning game, where he played Alex Noren.
A schoolboy and two doubles on the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swine in a hole they never managed to climb out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fours and fours are so exciting to watch up close because of the interactions between the couples, their advice, the advice they don't give, and how the game plan can change in a single stroke.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead for the final day, but this quarter-final also showed that the American team has the fighting spirit that some had doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe 10-6 ahead for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the quarter-finals and the quarter-finals on Saturday, with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Star quarterback Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offense with two wins over struggling Tiger Woods, and have scored four points at Le Golf National.
European team Thomas Bjørns, eager to regain the trophy it lost at Hazeltine Stadium two years ago, showed a great advantage over the United States in the morning's quarterfinal, winning 3-1.
The United States showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two games but failing to win the tie.
Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, and he and Molinari, who earned the nickname "Molliwood" after a spectacular weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they showed great teamwork, defeating the disappointing Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau 5-4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance on rare occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the quarterfinals and fours, and seven of those games in a row.
Justin Rose, who was excited for the morning's quarterfinal, rejoined his teammate Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals, and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world's top golfers.
Europe, however, was not in the best of hands on this mild, sunny day southwest of Paris.
Three-time champions of the Masters, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set the American record by two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Jon Rahm of Spain and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals and later came back to beat Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
It is only the second time in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four points at the start of an individual event, although Furyks' team would need only a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of being runners-up, it seems that Sunday's counterattack will be too much for them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is 'possible' without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday that the continued trade embargo would only increase their distrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for the country to dismantle its nuclear weapons alone under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN annual general assembly that North Korea had taken "a number of acts of goodwill" in the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging to stop developing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country, and under such circumstances it is impossible that we unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons first.
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "step-change" approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded for every step it took, his statement seemed special in that he did not deny unilateral nuclear disarmament outright as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the US president-in-office and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim was called to work on "the Korean nuclear disarmament" and Trump promised to ensure North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the tough trade embargo against North Korea.
"The Allies demand that nuclear disarmament be done first and increase the pressure by using the trade embargo to achieve their goals, even protesting the declaration of an end to war", Ri said.
It's only the dreams of people who don't know anything about us that a trade ban can bring us to our knees.
But the problem is that continued trade embargoes increase our distrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the US leader spoke about at the Council earlier this week.
The minister instead referred to three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea, over the past five months, adding: If the party to this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the stumbling block in the Korean disarmament issue.
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was very different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target missiles from North Korea to the US mainland after "the devilish President" Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
Last year, Trump threatened to take action against North Korea, but this year he praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that the trade embargo would remain in place until North Korea had destroyed all its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline on this, saying: "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council trade embargo must remain in force until complete nuclear disarmament has taken place and is confirmed".
The Security Council agreed to extend the trade embargo against North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and indicated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, claiming success, but only hours later North Korea condemned him for making "persuasive demands".
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to take down missile sites and nuclear plants if the United States took "compliant action".
He said Kim had told himself that the "consistent actions" he sought were assurances of security promised by Trump in Singapore and steps toward normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take classes in a time of rest
A new study at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an attempt to counter the growing tendency for students to stay up all night studying with the help of caffeine tablets.
A study found that students at the world's best universities often know little or nothing about the basics of self-esteem.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the program and believes it is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the study after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on study performance.
At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and asked, "Why am I being told this now, in my final year?"
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, will explain to students the basics of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic performance and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the program after noticing that students were very sleepy during the week.
The one-hour study program includes a variety of practical activities.
One section is a room in a residential school where students tap on coffee mugs, window sills, sneakers, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can be impaired by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good night's sleep.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A map of the school area with active symbols then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know this isn't going to change the behavior of students.
But we feel that they have a right to know this, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes", added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of staying up all night and studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increased pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate quality sleep should be the students' key to fighting stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid weight gain, since lack of sleep increases the brain's demand for food so that the body is nourished.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physics student from California, helped to put together the course, but he sat on one of the professor's chairs last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the study had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a study for all the students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master's students to complete a similar course before they start their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm clock to remind them to go to bed, and to wake them up, bearing in mind the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can confuse the body's internal clock and cause difficulty falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: mark from Menga down to Gerrards men
Rangers were still struggling on the field as a disintegrated team of Stevens Gerrard had to settle for a 1-0 loss to Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
Ibrox were looking for their first away win since their victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team gave Gerrard just his second defeat in his 18 games as manager, eight points behind top-flight Ladbrokes Premiership side Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers team seemed to lack all the inspiration and were never likely to recover.
Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston moves up to third, just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
Rangers could be in more trouble after linebacker Calum Spence was forced to undergo rehabilitation for a head injury after something was thrown at him from the guests' helmet.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that knocked Ayr out and qualified for the Betfred Cup.
Holt, however, stuck to the same Livi 11 lineup that reached the Hearts stage last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates were over the challenge.
The Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more chances with the ball that it caught.
They were supposed to score just two minutes into the game when the first pitch from Menga came from Scott Pitman in front of Allen McGregor's goal, but he missed.
A long extra shot from Keaghan Jacobs then ended up with Craig Halkett, but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the intercept.
The Rangers regained control of the game but seemed to live in hope rather than faith in their play in the final quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been given a bye at the end of the quarter, when he and Steven Lawless were playing together, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's call.
Rangers only managed to score two goals in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former goalkeeper of Ibrox, didn't need much to defend a shot from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although the opportunity from Livi in the 34th minute would have come despite the other team having the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, if only because of their perseverance.
The Rangers again failed to make any of the long extra effort from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not interfere when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose to pass to Menga who then scored easily.
Gerrard took over in the half and sent in Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly, and the switch was effective just as Morelos came in, but Kelly quickly broke in and ran to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to lure the guests into playing the exact kind of game they enjoyed playing, and Lithgow and Halkett caught each other's long-running broadcast.
Holts' team could have extended their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor was good at denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran to the goal from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, the Rangers' backup, wanted a second chance when he and Jacobs fell together, but Thomson turned it down.
Almanak: The Man Who Invented the Geiger counter
Here comes a page from our Sunday morning calendar: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFTER... this is the day the futurist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to a device called the Geiger meter.
The Geiger gauge has since gained a firm foothold in the scientific world, but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: What in the world is this?
Rogers: This is a Geiger measurement, used to detect radioactive material on board uranium.
When you put on this headset, you can hear the effects of the atoms from the radioactivity in the rocks.
It's really breaking now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to spot dangerous cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill dangerous cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of the treatment
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory
They can then see a protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and then inject it back into the patient.
An investigational drug has shown positive results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman, the vaccine cured ovarian cancer for more than 18 months, teaching immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The procedure involves taking immune cells from a patient, modifying them in the laboratory to detect a protein called HER2, found in many types of cancer, and then injecting the prototypes back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that the vaccine is very effective".
HER2 stops the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar procedure, in which immune cells are removed from patients and are known to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a single type of white blood cell.
Kanye West gave a lengthy speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA turban after appearing on the television show SNL.
It didn't end well.
The dance was performed at Kanye West's studio on Saturday Night Live after a lengthy speech in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hat, he spoke at length against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've talked to white people so many times, and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have been deported from the United States long ago", he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a segment in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made fun of Britt Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over the sexual harassment allegations of Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's long-running show was not aired, a recording of it was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make a mockery of West by releasing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received poor receptions from the backfield because of his hairstyle.
I was put in a rear-view mirror.
And they said unto me, Thou shalt not go up into the open with this gate.
They set me up!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole", he said, according to a report in the Washington Examiner.
West went on, "Do you want to see the hole?" and said he was going to put on his superhero status because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try the love.
His comments were met with a barrage from viewers at least twice, and SNL actors appeared shy, according to Variety, with one attendee telling the newspaper: "There was a standoff in the studio".
West had been invited to join the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance of "I Love It", dressed as a bottle by Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, leader of the conservative party TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR THIS MIGHTY RELATIONSHIP".
But Karen Hunter, a talk show host, said on Twitter that West was simply being himself, and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I feel is supporting and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
"We are, too", she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now the "beast" formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and paternal grandfather's name to follow in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and not to be forgotten is the music legend Prince the Hated, who changed his name to an icon and later called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in east Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Coronation Games, criticizes the toxicity of masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO crime-adventure series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, however, has criticized the stereotype of the male hero, saying that such on-screen roles often mean that young boys feel they have to be tough to earn respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of male poisoning in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Crown Games co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had "strong opinions" about how to handle the matter.
"I personally feel at the moment - what has gone wrong with masculinity?"
What did we teach men growing up about the problems we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the rise of male toxicity, because of the very masculine characters on television.
He continued: "What is involved and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they must be determined by man?
I think that's one of the most important questions of our time -- how do we change this?
Because it's obvious that something has gone wrong with the young men.
He also admitted in the interview that he would not be appearing in any more Coronation episodes after the series airs next summer, saying that he had been given "a lot of fortresses and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a re-imagining of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is kidnapped.
The actor recently said that the best thing about playing in the Coronation Games was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on these shows, so they gave me some way to my future family and my life after that", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, who Kit played in these Emmy-winning shows.
The couple married in June 2018, at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV or who are suffering from dementia.
Health officials say that over 820,000 people are infected in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections were caused by sexual contact, a change from what was previously the case.
Previously, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China because of donated infected blood.
The number of people infected with HIV in this way has, in turn, dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected with HIV, or AIDS, has increased by 100,000 each year.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but widespread discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still occurring.
Because of the country's conservative policies, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections are the result of inadequate fertility in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from Republican senators, criticizing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
Congresswoman Maxine Waters denied on Saturday that one of her staffers had posted the personal information of three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said these allegations came from far-right activists and websites.
"Lies, lies and more disgraceful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was leaked online Thursday from an unknown source on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on sexual assault charges.
The game came some time after the three senators had interviewed Kavanaugh.
Content sites on board Gateway Pundit and RedState said the IP numbers that identify the source of the information were linked to Waters' office and released information about one of its employees, according to Capitol Hill.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and a lie", Waters continued.
My employee - whose privacy and security are now at risk because of these false allegations - was in no way responsible for this information leak.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and a lie.
Waters's statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House correspondent Ara Fleischer.
"This denial is full of anger", Fleischer wrote.
It indicates that she has no nerve to sit in parliament.
When someone is falsely accused, do not react with anger.
You can't resist.
It is not proper to question the motives of the accuser.
It must be calm and considerate.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics said appeared to be too angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Great story if true", he said.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement officials of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the other victims are found", she continued, "and that they are held accountable for all the actions that are shameful and dangerous to all my employees".
Film score for Johnny English Strikes Again - a spy comedy starring Rowan Atkinson is proving to be a bit of a powerhouse
It's become a habit of the modern day to look for references to Brexit in all new films where Britain is involved, and that seems to be relevant in this revival of the Johnny English comic strip - which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and just came back to life in 2011 with the film Johnny English Reborn.
Will this canteen satire on how patently miserable we are be a new export tool for the country?
In any case, the outgoing, cryptic, and clumsy Johnny English has been granted a second license to make a mess of everything - his name indicating, above all, that he is a work designed for exhibition in other English-speaking countries.
He's, of course, the clever intelligence officer who pretends to live in a world of thrilling characters, but is a little bit of a mix of Clouseau, the bass of Mr. Bean, and a little bit of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the original traveller and mysterious citizen of the world that Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he dissociated himself from the world in disarray.
There's one or two good things about this latest Johnny English movie.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk to the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the helicopter blades in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his comic talent, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that more serious films like James Bond and Mission Impossible also offer a sense of humor.
The comic seems more for children than for adults, and I found the adventure Johnny English got into not as imaginative and focused as the silent Atkinson comic in Mr. Beans.
The film's current premise is that Britain is in big trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into the British intelligence network and identify all the British spies, much to the chagrin of the spy on guard - but unfortunately Kevin Eldon plays too small a role.
This is the final nail in the coffin for the Prime Minister, who is an arrogant and controversial figure and already in great danger from massive political unfortunates: Emma Thompson is doing her best in her role as a character supposedly reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script is not up to much fish for her.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who has been placed in the sacred stone.
And then comes Johnny English himself, now the principal of some fancy school, but also giving secret lessons on how to be a spy: here are some funny jokes that English offers on a spy school that reminds of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets Bough, his long-tired former partner, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine captain, but in that energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine is not quite able to let her light shine.
The nightmare that has disrupted everything in Her Majesty's service is now back in action and meets the high-ranking officer Opheliu Bulletovu, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is enjoying the charms of the glamorous tech billionaire who claims to be able to unravel Britain's computer world: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their falling-out: they light up a fine French restaurant with the dummies who serve, they cause trouble when they sneak into the luxury Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use a virtual reality camera to introduce himself inside Volta's house.
There is no saving in the ending, but while the film is powerful and energetic, it does contain some childish content in its entirety.
It's a medium-sized stuff.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matches his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is working on a four-day workweek for the British, with the same pay as for a five-day week.
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now considering a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants to allow executives to take advantage of the savings from the artificial intelligence revolution and to give workers one extra day off.
Then workers could enjoy three days of extended weekends without a reduction in wages.
Sources say the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and its policy of improving the welfare of the working class.
The Trades Union Congress has backed the shortening of the working week to four days, as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A spokesman for the Labour Party's top leadership told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"The change will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the party's approach to changing the economy in favour of workers and the party's overall industrial policy".
Labour would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
The aim, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not on the party's agenda and the party is not considering introducing it".
John McDonnell, the Shadow Secretary of Commerce, used the Labour Party conference last week to lay out his ideas for social revolution within the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from the "unknown" CEOs and "vegetable collectors" of the grain companies.
The Shadow Secretary's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies may not get their full shares back as the Labour government could impose a "default" for alleged wrongdoing.
He has also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and to create a joint-ownership fund to give 10 per cent of the assets of private companies to their employees, who could get £500 a year in their pocket.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say 60 minutes whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh might get them to change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has caused at least a week's delay in the final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its results could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter for 60 Minutes, asked Republicans and Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that might change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I told you when the trial started, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, steadfast, unquestioning.
Graham's vote, however, seems to be unchanged.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible accusation to change that", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this I do know: Brett flatly denied it, Graham added, and called Christine Blasey Ford.
And none of those she mentioned by name could confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the World Urban Day, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that brings together a string of stars with a similarly powerful agenda: ending poverty worldwide, will take place on Saturday in New York.
This is the seventh year of the International Urban Festival, and tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park, not only to hear music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, among others, but also to raise awareness of the festival's realistic goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Urban Day, first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, an international coalition of organizations that seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who fight it.
To receive free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the festival been, now 12 years into the process?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts really a way to convince people to call for action, or is it just a so-called "message" - where people feel they are doing something important by signing a list online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million actions from its supporters, calling for a wide variety of causes.
It says that these efforts have helped to get world leaders to declare commitments and policies worth over $35 billion that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group recorded 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its activities, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One major commitment comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and CEO organization that works to "help children enjoy themselves fully", and pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, following 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of working a thing of the past", Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition, told an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after 5,000 appeals for better nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
One of the questions on the group's website is: "Why do you think you can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It's going to be a long and difficult task - sometimes we're going to fail over and over again.
But, we will reach our limits, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, because we are stronger together.
This year's event will feature Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Monáe, and will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use navy as a barrier to block Russian energy exports, says interior minister
"If necessary", Washington could use the navy to prevent Russia's energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, says Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, according to a report by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russian assistance to Syria, especially since it operates under the auspices of the legitimate government there, was a model for exploring new markets.
'I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy like in Eastern Europe and the southern part of it,' he is quoted as saying.
And, according to the official announcement, there are ways and means to counter it.
"The federal government can use the navy to ensure that the sea lanes are open and to form a barrier, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was addressing a meeting of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls itself the "Voice of the Energy Consumers" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying it was more or less the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less energy efficiency and replacing it with others", he said, adding that Russia has only one game in mind with an economy that would be dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement follows the Trump administration's desire to increase its natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to get Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 project to lay a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly argued that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Russians say Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy should not be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States' position has been criticized by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial union, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to part with the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that an external power is trading our energy sector", said Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, and Vladimir Putin, president of Russia.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, she says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider running for a seat on the Holyoke, Massachusetts, town council.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and sing our government, and then we need a woman to lead", she said, according to a report by The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for President.
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "of course we have to have the FBI investigate this before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that a majority of voters in Warren County do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her candidacy.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent saying they supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent saying they opposed it.
Other popular Democrats discussed for a possible 2020 presidential nomination included former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he plans to make a public decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about the impact of the Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"My son is going through a lot of hardship after returning, I feel with other families who are affected by the stress of the fall and the emotional wounds that our soldiers bring home", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come back a little different, hardened, and wondering if any respect is being paid for what their comrades in the Army and Air Force and other branches of the military have done for the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempted obstruction of a report of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support a challenge to the new health care policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims of gang or domestic violence a place to live.
Representatives from 18 states and the city filed a lawsuit Friday in Washington to support a homeless man who opposes the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal agency has not been disclosed.
She said that her husband and his violent sons, who were members of the rebellion, had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries where domestic violence is a growing problem, and the number of asylum seekers coming to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum investigation reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, the Washington state attorney general, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all court applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates that rule", the court report said.
Lawyers further stated in the report that the policy of denying immigrants entry was detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start businesses and create a vital workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and retaliation in June.
"Those who leave their home countries because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
The church was never meant to solve all the problems, not even the serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in the race to find survivors in Palu, the death toll doubles
Things will get even more difficult for those who survive.
"There is a lot of tension in the air", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforts her ailing son at the relief center in the city of Palu.
Ambulances bring bodies in all the time.
There is little clean water.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes and searching their water-supply holdings to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed and damaged by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, lay outside the Palu military hospital, where patients were being evacuated due to the continuing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he described how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I pushed myself up against the walls, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, saying his family had been in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of harassment by making a statement
A week after China's state-run newspaper published four recent ads in American newspapers discussing the mutual benefits of trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about an ad in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. Senate election, a charge China denies.
Trump's claim that Beijing wanted to interfere in the US congressional elections marketed what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are engaged in an escalating trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and American experts say China's retaliatory measures early in the trade war were designed to hurt immigrants in states along the Iowa border, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a state that exports a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in an op-ed piece in the Des Moines Register Sunday that China is now increasing its persecution by publishing propaganda in our own free press.
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the beloved principles of free speech and our free press by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said in his article.
"On the other hand, there are few protests in the newspaper booths on the streets of Beijing, and there is no true reflection of the different views that Chinese people may have on China's worrying economic policy, as the media is stuck under the umbrella of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "several of the major newspapers in China" had been denied an offer to publish his article, but he did not mention which one.
Experts warn that Republicans are making women voters reconsider them for the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh case.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections, because many Republicans have supported and opposed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has filed sexual harassment charges.
There's been a lot of excitement around this issue, and most Republicans have already publicly indicated that they want to start a vote.
"You can't undo these things", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Republican Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute call for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November, Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the liberal group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the halls of the Senate when the Republicans who controlled the ruling committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The interest and enthusiasm of the voters will rise above all power", Stu Rothenberg, an independent politician, told the news website.
People will say that there's already been a lot of interest, and that's true.
But it might be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president but vote rarely.
Analysts predicted a setback if Republicans pushed for Kavanaugh's confirmation, even before Ford's testimony in which she laid out her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
"This has become a major embarrassment for the Republican Party", Michael Still, a former Republican National Committee member, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news outlet.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe in the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a majority support the latter.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be certain or probable, while 35 percent said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony to be certain or probable.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they thought Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's call, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and by at least one other woman, Deboruh Ramirez, according to a report by the Guardian.
Ford testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 and that he was under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh wore his genitals in front of her when they were both at a Yale University party in the 1990s.
The man who invented the Internet has plans to start a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the Internet, is going to start a seed company to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open-source toolkit.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access what information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea behind Inrupt was "universal".
"We have to do this now", he said of the rum company.
This is a historic moment.
The program uses technology from Solid to allow people to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It may include a list of contacts, to-do lists, calendars, music library, and other personal and work-related devices.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being in one browser at the same time.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is completely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "data-driven personalization".
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes and relevant expertise to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security engineer who was bought by IBM, a few programmers who were hired as contractors to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team would not be in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a radical change that would overturn their current business model overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt's goal is to create a business and ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even while he runs Inrupt.
"I am very optimistic about the next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I honoured
The only English priest to be honoured with the Victoria Cross in World War I as a soldier has been honoured in his home town 100 years later.
Sergeant Bernard Vann, who held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Army, received the Cross on 29 September 1918 during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by snipers four days later, and he never learned that he had been awarded the British Army's highest decoration.
Two of his descendants unveiled a memorial to him at a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said that it was "beautifully symbolic" that the memorial was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's funeral.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his lieutenant-colonel's regiment across the Canal de Saint-Quentin gorge through a thickly-capped bay and under heavy fire from parachutes and machine guns.
Later, he ran to the line of fire and, with great courage, led the line forward before attacking the paratrooper of his squadron and overwhelming three soldiers.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed one of his lieutenants, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's heroic death was "something I could never do, but something that makes you humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid wreaths at the procession, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured" to take part in the parade, adding that "the acts of true heroes are shown by the support shown by so many".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting to see Gurru Cheese
Imagine, having stayed up all night watching the crowded Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The schedule featured 13 fights from San Jose, six of which were on the main schedule, and were shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5's line-up.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers were surprised when the broadcast turned into Gurru grise.
Some were dissatisfied after staying up all night to watch the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change in child pornography as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to official rules, the material was not suitable for viewers at 6 a.m. so they had to switch to children's material", Dave Schwartz, Bellator's vice president of marketing and communications, said when interviewed for the broadcast.
- I'll have some grilled cheese.
Scott Coker, director of Bellator, said they would review their schedules and include UK audiences in the calculation in the future.
"I think when I think of the review that we could probably sort this out", said Coker.
But it's 6:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning there, and we can't solve this until Sunday, our time, which is Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the switch was made, there were a lot of text messages going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a public problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're limiting the night to five fights instead of six, as usual, but we tried too hard and we went too far.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley found guilty of sexual misconduct
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says that he felt disrespected toward other people in his youth because of his sexual orientation, but that this motivated him to succeed.
Daley, 24, said that he did not realize that "he was different" until he went to journalism school.
On the Radio 4 radio show Desert Island Discs, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about the rights of gay people to give others a chance.
He also said that parenting had distracted him from winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular chairwoman, has taken a few months off work because of illness.
Daley appeared as a guest star in the first episode of Laverne, and said that he found him to be "a smaller person" than anyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls".
He said: "To this day, this feeling of being insignificant and different has given me the strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so that he would not disappoint anyone when his sexuality finally came up.
The double Olympic bronze medalist has made a name for himself as an LGBT supporter and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he was lucky to be able to live in public without punishment and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but said the age gap had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - but he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - "it's hard to find someone your age who has experienced the same successes and challenges".
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "all-around life" had been crushed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was all about winning the gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son is baptized in the head of Robert, his father, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was whether they were ready to get their medals for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was not until his breathing stopped and he was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that I had dreamed of this all my life, to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympics.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song - Proud by Heather Small - which had inspired him for the Olympics and still gave him a good skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11.15am UK time.
Mickelson in poor form and sitting on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday as he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to find his old rhythm so the record isn't surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who is playing in the tournament for the 12th time, was left on the bench by the decision of head coach Jim Furyk for the quarterfinals and quarterfinals on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has so often been for the United States, the five-time champion splits his day between being a clapping man and practicing the moves on the field in the hope of correcting his own anger.
Mickelson, 48, was never the one to shoot straight with the killer, and is not the best player for Le Golf National, where long-lost punishments often occur for poor shots.
Not only is the golf course a challenge in itself, Mickelson will face Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in Game 9 on Sunday, with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood leading the way, and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, take the first of 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be a game changer.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, but he could hardly say much else.
"He understood perfectly the role he had today, patted me on the back and took me in his arms and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's been such a boon to the team before and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I saw more ahead, but that's how it ended and we said we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the other achievements in his record.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 ties, but Furyk said his presence would have a certain vague effect on the team.
"He's funny, he's cool, he's funny, he likes to make fun of people, and it's great to have him in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed playing him this week, too, and it was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just the game of golf.
Thomas Bjorn, the leader of Europe, knows that much progress can be quickly lost
European team Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup individual competition can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
Daninn first played in a game at Valderrama in 1997, where the side under the captaincy of Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but managed to claim victory in the end with the lowest possible score, with 141⁄2-131⁄2 victory.
"One always remembers that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only just like that", said Bjorn, who is pictured here, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on both Friday and Saturday and take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone on this team that this isn't over.
We'll all be laid up tomorrow.
Let's go and do it right.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
We have our goal and that is to try to win this cup, we focus on that
I've always said this, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we're very aware of our counterparts on the other team - the best golfers in the world.
Bjorn was pleased with the way his players had handled difficult pitches, adding: "I never excel myself in this.
Tomorrow, everything will be different.
Tomorrow, it's the performance of the individual that matters, and that's another thing.
It's great to play with friends when everything is going well, but when you play alone, you're testing your abilities as a golfer.
It's the message we need to send to the players, to make the best of ourselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to play his best game himself.
Unlike Bjorn, his coach, Jim Furyk, will seek to make his players perform better in individual matches rather than with teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brooklyn but ended up losing when Europe carried out the Medinah nuclear power plant.
"I remember every damn word", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 starter, would have encouraged his players to stay on for the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you did in Brooklyn and Medina.
As the ladder builds up, it puts a lot of pressure on the balls in the middle.
We've sorted our players accordingly and let them play as we think will be best tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the defense and plays against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this series because I think they cover the whole way through", Bjorn said of his selection of players in the individual competition.
New German Navy Postponed Again
The newest German Navy warship was supposed to be built in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it won't be ready until early next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to local news.
Construction on the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Party's new guerrilla forces, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to sources from the military spokesman speaking to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be commissioned by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after delivery plagued the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the aging Bremen-class fleet.
They are to be equipped with a more powerful parachute, multiple air and naval firefighters, and radar, infrared, and sound signals.
Other important features are longer service life - the latest vessels should be able to operate for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, steady losses mean that these state-of-the-art ships - which are said to enable Germany to show off its strength at sea - will be obsolete by the time they are finally deployed, says Die Zeit.
The F125 made headlines last year when the German military officially refused to accept the plane and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the disbandment, but the German media reported on many women severely "deaf in hardware and machinery" that rendered the ship useless if sent into battle.
Software gaps were particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of 120, half the size of Bremen-class ships.
It was also found to be too heavy, which impairs its performance and limits the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Aside from hardware flaws, the cost of the whole project - including training the hobbyist - has become problematic.
It is said to have reached 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), but was originally supposed to be 2.2 billion euros.
The problems plaguing the newest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that German overseas possessions are dwindling.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was in fact becoming a "super-corps" with functioning ships.
The problem, he said, had been compounded over time by the decommissioning of older ships, which were not replaced.
He regretted that none of the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be taken into service by the navy.
National Trust Conservation Association spying on the secret life of leatherback
A new study in rural Scotland is aimed at finding out how the leatherback uses the landscape when it hunts for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these solitary flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of clay blocks in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be installed at key locations throughout the area to monitor the behaviour of the mud flats over time.
NHS staff and volunteers will also be taking tours with handheld sensors.
Experts will analyze all the recordings to determine the frequency of calls, which cluster of leather is making, and which species are doing what.
Habitat maps and reports are then produced to provide a precise picture of their behaviour at a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a nightlife consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will shed light on what habitats are most important to the leatherback and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating nests and how best to maintain forestland for clay blocks and other related species.
Lead blocks have declined dramatically over the last century in Scotland and throughout Britain.
They are threatened by construction and development projects that affect their breeding habitats and reduce their habitat.
Windmills and light can also pose dangers, as can airplane paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
Leather blocks are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to hunting, for they are accustomed to hunting at night.
They used advanced mining techniques to find insects and other objects in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks, and 76,000 acres of land throughout the country, takes clay blocks very seriously.
The organizations have ten experts who regularly carry out inspections, surveys, and sometimes rescue operations.
The associations have even established Scotland's first and only leatherback farm at Threave Farm in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten leatherback species.
David Thompson, the farm supervisor, says it's the perfect area for them.
"The area here at Threave is great for clay blocks", he said.
We have old buildings, plenty of mature trees, and plenty of good living space.
But there is still much unknown about leather blocks, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to clean.
He stressed the importance of checking leather blocks before maintenance is carried out on the farm, as possible accidental destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 female leather blocks and young and destroy all leather blocks in the area.
Leatherback turtles are protected and are not permitted to kill, harm or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about cotton blocks, and we don't know how well many of them are doing".
Ronaldo denies rape charges. Lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations of rape "fake news" and says people want to "attract attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are going after the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga by name, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 in back taxes for keeping quiet about the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, told his 142 million followers in an Instagram Live video that they were fake news.
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What was said today is fake news", the five-time world champion told the camera.
These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's only natural.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unlawful disclosure of suspected privacy", according to Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would be fined for "humanitarian harm of the same amount and gravity as the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After visiting a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Attorney's Office in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 99 percent good man who had fallen into temptation because of the 1 percent.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had her effects photographed in a hospital, but eventually agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared to death of reprisals" and worried about being publicly humiliated.
She's now saying she wants to stop the shows because she's still in shock after an alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain would look back on losing carmakers forever
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its position as the global leader among carmakers after Brexit, says Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was of concern that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of losses at the border if a no-deal Brexit became a reality would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
"I think if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll see the production facilities in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's chief executive at Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without agreement on how international trade should proceed, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers say are supply chain risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota's production line is based on 'last minute' delivery, with parts being delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be border disruptions that the industry believes could lead to losses and shortages of shares.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than daily stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would therefore cease.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border.
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that allows us to not only enjoy success in the modern era but also as an opportunity that we can take advantage of", he said on BBC Radio 4.
The data, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, show that we have to be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run the increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the factory's union, said that his colleagues were becoming increasingly concerned: "My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: 'We have put forward a detailed and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House announced Sunday that a crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Rod Rosenstein, the assistant attorney general, could be rescheduled for another week as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstructions to the president's rightful hand.
For weeks, there have been rumors in Washington about whether Trump will fire the assistant attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a recorder to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, amidst news that he was about to resign.
Instead, it was announced that he would meet with Trump on Thursday, but he was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't want to fire Rosenstein", but then the meeting was adjourned so he wouldn't be in the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump's press secretary, was on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "It's not set yet, it could be this week, I think it's possible that it will be postponed for another week because of all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see about that, and I'm always happy to inform the media.
Some news sources disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The program director, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the low number of meetings was not because of dissatisfaction with the fact that TV reporters were "visual", but she did say, "I don't disagree with the fact that they are "visual".
She then gave hints that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is answering more questions from the media than any other president has ever done", she said, without citing sources: "We've gone over these numbers".
Press conferences will still be held, Sanders said, but if the media has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks, and it's going to be a media circle when you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with other visiting leaders.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
The president may have demonstrated why in New York this week, when he displayed a ruthless and sometimes bizarre demeanor in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU health workers in Scotland over Brexit anticipation
The Health Minister has written to EU staff working within NHS Scotland to express the nation's gratitude and wish it to continue its work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter in less than six months to the date of Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the costs of work permit applications for EU nationals working in the public service.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: 'Since the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on the dispute have continued and a decision is expected in the autumn.
The British government has also been working on preparations in the event of a no-deal.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate my deep appreciation for the work of all our staff, regardless of their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and knowledge that strengthens and improves the healthcare work and benefits the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, linebacker for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to a report by Mike Organ, the Tennessean reporter.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the impact was felt just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there", Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a tube and taken out for further examination.
Tennessee State representative Chris Harris, of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, said Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "little information on the nature or severity of the impact yet" and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, a senior in high school, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after fleeing Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before he went out, bringing his total to 18.
Foreign buyers are being hit with higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be reimbursed for higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, according to a new Conservative plan
The action will make no impact on Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxpayers in the UK
The government's fund plans to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by promising affordable housing and taxing senior citizens instead.
Individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK will have to pay higher stamp duty, and the proceeds will go to government measures to help the homeless.
The increase - in addition to the current stamp duty, including the two-year increase in extra housing and rental property - could be as high as three percent.
The government estimates that the increase will generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of London's new developments are bought by foreigners, which causes inflation and makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the market.
Many developed areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the influx of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to drop quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's housing crisis.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of significant reforms to housing, including a rent review and an end to the no-fault eviction of tenants.
He also wants to give the kings more authority to build new homes.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would devote my first term to restoring the British dream - that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our underutilized housing market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be true that it is as easy for foreigners and companies based abroad to buy a home as it is for skilled British nationals.
For many, the dream of owning a home has become too distant, and the pain of homelessness remains too real.
Jack Ross: "My main goal is to coach Scotland".
Jack Ross, Sunderland manager, says it's his "greatest goal" to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scot is now taking the challenge to breathe new life into the North-East club, which is now in third place in the Premier League, three points off the top.
He moved to Sunderland last summer after returning to the Scottish Premier League with St Mirren last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I got a knee injury and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland in Hampden with my dad, as a kid, and there's always something that's drawn me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I was successful in coaching the department.
Ross' former Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such big names at such a big club, but had previously turned down coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"As I measure my success, I think: Can I get this club back into the Premier League?"
"This club is unquestionably at home in the Premier League because of its structure and facilities", he said.
It's not an easy job getting him up there, but I'd probably only consider myself lucky here if I get the club back up there.
Ross has just three years experience as a coach, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division, and turned the relegated St Mirren into league champions the following season.
Ross says he's more confident now, but he's spent time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real time game", he says of the season he became coach of Alloa.
I really believed that coaching was for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was doing well, I was making a decent living, and I was having a great success.
But making changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I'm still going through the stress and pressure of my job, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing it, I've never felt better about myself in all my adult life.
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12pm and 1pm UK time.
The best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a poll.
The summer heat wave has been a boon for British barley farmers, but it has added pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales at pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent in July, while sales at restaurants fell 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and England's unexpected success at the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to June, when barsalas rose by 2.8 percent, except for the fact that restaurants sold even less.
Sales at restaurants fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which focused on the sale of drinks, lasted the longest with more swings, while restaurants fell behind.
Pubs selling food also suffered from sun exposure, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people just wanted to go out drinking.
Drinking and drinking salts increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while meals decreased by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, of the analytics firm RSM, said: 'These results are a continuation of the fluctuations we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to out-of-home sales.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups are still struggling, though monthly sales of 4.8 percent are particularly painful on top of continued cost pressures.
This long and hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for food stalls, and only time will tell whether temperate temperatures, such as we have had in August, will improve the situation.
Total sales growth at pubs and restaurants, including those opening new stores, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the performance of the openings.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the monitoring company for the UK pub and restaurant sector, collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups, with a combined value of £9 billion and is the industry benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
One in five children, as young as 11, has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 students showed an increase in Instagram activity
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornography
Twenty percent of students say they have a personal account that they show their parents.
One in five children, as young as 11, creates secret social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students showed a huge increase in the number of Instagram accounts - a reference to the website Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of pornographic material.
Twenty percent of the students were said to have a clean "private" account to show their parents, as well as secret accounts.
One mother who went to the secret Web site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to rape me.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 had two accounts, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: "It is worrying that so many young people are tempted to create online areas where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle will be the Scottish Athletics Commission's Athletes' Voice
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful female freestyle athlete and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee, said the nomination was a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her extensive experience on the international stage over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected within the sporting community in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are sure that Scottish sport would benefit greatly from her membership of the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: 'I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and hope that I can contribute and help to take the sport forward in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but who has four Olympic medals in total, and who now regularly appears on the BBC, was paralyzed after a brief bout of thrombosis.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I have recovered fully, learned to walk again, and am doing athletic training today!
Thank you for your encouragement!
Breast pump ads that compare mothers to cows cause online controversy
A company that makes breast pumps is now the subject of an online advert that feeds milk cows to mothers.
Inspired by music videos, Elvie's company released a promotional advertisement to mark what it claims is the world's first portable breast-feeding sound pump.
Four real mothers dance in a ball of hay and sing a song with the words: "Yes, I'm milking, but you can't see any hay on me" and "If you can't see it, it's not the eggs, it's my breasts".
The audience goes on: "Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump milk from the jellies".
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused a stir online.
The video, which has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it is linked to the "milk industry riots".
Really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must become calves and bear to produce milk, except that the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born", said one commentator.

Another viewer wrote: "Understandably difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who are allowed to hold their babies?
Another added: "This ad is completely out of date".
Others objected to the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was "improvising".
I think this is a great idea.
I would have bought one of these if I still had a baby in my breast.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
"This is a brilliant product", wrote one viewer.
Another said: "It's a funny ad for mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like a baby".
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the ad, the women's group shows that they have all been dancing with the breast pump pads in their breastplates.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women say that they feel like a pump when they pump milk out.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or guides, and fits comfortably on top of the breast holder, giving women freedom to move, hold their baby, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and manager of Mother, said: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a prominent introduction that will make a big splash.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to direct the spotlight on the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in an entertaining and informative way how liberating the new pump would be.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, two mothers of two children appeared at a fashion show for designer Mörtu Jakubowski, while she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in foster care has increased dramatically even though the number of those who cross the border each month has remained roughly the same, in part because the harsh language and policies of the Trump administration have made it harder to get the children into foster care.
Usually the adoptive parents have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their chances of staying in the country by offering to adopt a child.
The threat increased in June, when government officials announced that prospective foster parents and other adults in the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with Immigration Services.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Senate that his agency had arrested a number of people who were seeking to raise children alone.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either foster parents or in foster homes are in the country illegally, and many of them are illegal immigrants on record.
"Because we're going to keep looking for those individuals", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the process, officials announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than 60 days, according to a child protection official.
Many will attend via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their legal position before immigration judges.
Children who are deemed ineligible for entry are quickly deported.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent behavior or flight attempts, according to the staff and reports published by the system in recent months.
Speakers said that these problems are even more likely in larger institutions like Tornillo, where no one is likely to notice that a child is having difficulty because of the number of them.
They added that taking children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare spiritually or to say goodbye to friends could add to the stress that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria tells US, French and Turkish military teams to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech to the UN General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in Syria under the false premise that they are fighting terrorism and that they should be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the council.
Moualem insisted that the war on terrorism is nearly over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to wage this holy struggle until we clear all Syrian territory of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign actors.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
As for the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions were good enough for them to return and he taught "some Western countries" about the "spreading of unjustified fear" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return", he said.
They're making politics out of something that should be purely a human issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to ending the war.
The Council's special representatives say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last great fortress of the conflict has created an opportunity to continue political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the territory of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had an "unambiguous deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, and that they would be "eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN Ambassador, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition, to sign a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "overriding the decisions of the current government", and warned against any aggression.
Reasons why Trump will win another term
According to that argument, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020, barring impeachment and the scandal that would end his presidency, as many liberal observers would probably hope.
In what would be arguably the most dramatic end to a presidential career ever!
Like the audience is not tired.
Since 2014, viewership of prime time has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers at its peak, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has topped the ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news outlets.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, host of ABC's "Designated Survivor", about a government employee who becomes president after Congress is bombed in a terrorist attack.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comic book writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different idea.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The bus driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
'He said, 'Because he comes to me to laugh,' said Miss Scovell to me.
There's a lot of fun in the mess.
However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Only those who enjoy the greatest privileges can afford to stop watching.
And yet, it's more than being an informed citizen when you look at the sixth hour of a panel of experts arguing Bob Woodward's use of the "Fear" for his book, or the $15,000 strawberry jacket that Paul Manafort wore (a type that is fed by pride, the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's meticulous biological descriptions of Mr. Trump.
At least I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does to make it feel like a reality show is he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, as he discussed the Trump show's labor dictatorship and daily storyline changes (such as starting a fight with the NFL and praising Kim Jong-Un in the park).

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss, it was 60 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he stayed indoors and watched MSNB while he recorded CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
I remember when we were making all these crazy episodes in the old days and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.

Money flows out of the closest election of the Middle Ages
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is seeing a cash flow, thanks to a redistricting that resulted in two representatives running for the same seat.
The reorganized Pittsburgh district is running Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in the second district in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running against another representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which clashes heavily with the new 17th district.
The map of the electoral districts was revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized in favor of the Republicans and that it violated the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th Congressional District has been the beginning of a campaign finance race between the two major campaign funders, the Democratic-Republican-Conservative Committees (DCCC) and the Republican-Conservative Committees (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after Nauman won a special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, but many watched the election.
Republicans had previously held that seat for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its support of China, but then it backed down.
Government officials noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little objection from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a quiet meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, the president of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until co-owners kicked the Trump administration's conspiracy team out.
State Department officials decided to recall the U.S. ambassadors to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief efforts in 2017, including drug control, development work and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting back on financial aid and restricting residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, which has high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As the internal meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting held last year and was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from immigrating to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the convention to take place, thus ending all talk of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of how important it is to the administration, the sources said.
The three U.S. ambassadors also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to discuss further the discussions described by the three U.S. representatives, including two special advisers, who agreed to discuss domestic demands on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside source who works closely with the administration and also spoke on the subject on condition of anonymity.
Learn From the Story
The next issue of concern may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible actions by Mr. Trump to obstruct justice, but that allegation is backed by a wealth of public evidence.
It is also being said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign worked with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress is controlled by a different party, Trump may have to take responsibility for it, as he prepares to meet his constituents again, and possibly a quorum appointed for his peers.
These are very uncertain, however, and I don't want to imply that Trump's fall is certain, nor the fall of his colleagues in Europe.
We all have a choice, on either side of the Atlantic, that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, provided that Western countries gave him counter-support and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the disastrous years that followed.
History revolves around such critical points and speeds or stages for the unstable progress of democracy.
The Americans are facing some of these critical issues right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the man who's in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad place since this paper reported that last year he had proposed to make secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was unfit to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is not accurate.
What will we do if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a midterm Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will have to endure a long winter.
But I think we're not going to fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government and had previously been in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not look forward to our future with optimism?

Graham Dorrans, Rangers, looking forward to the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win over the Austrians will put them in a strong position to advance from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season before the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes Rangers can use the results as a springboard for better results.
"It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team", said Dorrans, 31.
We started the game believing we could get something, and we ended up taking a step.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came in strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another big night for the European League.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did well in their last game, but with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can hold on and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both because of my injury and the changes that have taken place in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling in the place.
The team is good, the boys are enjoying themselves, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the last game behind us and get a result.
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing their retirement savings
Although the respondents had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they discussed it with their children.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they don't take the proper steps to have those conversations", said Holly Snyder, senior vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's how it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for caregiving if you do not make your wishes clear in advance.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you will receive care, as these options can make a big difference in terms of cost.
Involve your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you find a way to pay for this expense.
The options you have to pay for long-term insurance include traditional life insurance with long-term insurance, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash to help pay for expenses, or self-insurance with your own money - as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Prevent legal disputes in advance
Get a healthcare representative so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your healthcare and ensure that healthcare professionals will follow your wishes if you cannot express them directly yourself.
Also, consider having a proxy for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you cannot do it yourself.
Consider the details: Imagine that your aged parent has an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please provide the details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just about the money, but also who the doctors are", Martin said.
What are the drugs?
Who's gonna watch the dog?
Have that plan ready.
Man shot multiple times by an aerial gun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times by an aerial gun as he walked home from a party.
The victim is a man in his 50s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, groin and hand.
Officials describe the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 local time UK, as a random attack.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The man was not seriously injured, and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquake and Flood in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With all communications down, emergency responders have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, a region north of Palu that lies near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were displaced in Palu after the unfortunate outbreak.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the bottom of a narrow strip of land on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. The estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a province that stretches over 380 km (320 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The province-level administrative region of Silesia had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries in Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is most concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Bureau of Meteorology, Palu and Donggala have been hit by floods several times in the past century.
In 1938, over 200 people died when a tidal wave swept over Donggala and destroyed hundreds of houses.
Also, in 1996, the western part of Donggala was hit by a flood that killed nine people.
Indonesia sits on the active Pacific Ring of Fire and has a regular earthquake record.
Here are the major earthquakes and floods of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra hit on December 26, triggering a tidal wave that shook 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, roughly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds are dying on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the southern tip of the island of Jovo, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tidal wave that shook the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tidal wave that destroyed many villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A massive earthquake hits Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, causing devastation and terror, and people remember the devastation of the deadly earthquakes and floods of 2004.
No flooding occurred this time, but over 100 buildings collapsed and killed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sohr Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and presidential candidate Sohr Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for attempting to block a domestic violence report and for resisting arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her friend when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime.
Palin is being held at Mat-Su station where he is awaiting his trial, and he is being held on $500 bail, according to a KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty, pot-bellied when asked to plead guilty or not guilty, according to the news report.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently being processed by the Alaska Military Rehabilitation Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, withholding a domestic violence report and carrying a weapon while under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend has claimed that he slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by activist groups in 2016 after she taught a shock-storm lesson about her son's violent behavior, following his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and flood in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake triggered a flood wave that has destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications systems are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central island of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos of the incident are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the waves shook the shore.
Prosecutors seek a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of involvement in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is believed to have rented a Home Depot truck to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he knocked down pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and inflicted "intentional" serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty consent decree, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges could lead to a possible death sentence, according to court documents.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal court indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with criminal intent, which is usually used by prosecutors in criminal cases against organized crime organizations.
The attack involved "considerable premeditated acts", prosecutors said, describing Sapiov's actions as "horrible, cruel, and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was selected for bodily injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last adopted a death penalty case for medical purposes.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution was carried out in a New York court in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both couples were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He told investigators that he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he got the idea for the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a conviction for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole will only prolong the impact of this event for all parties involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked the prosecution not to investigate the death sentence.
The Conservative MP says that Nigel FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to activate the People's Army today at a protest at the Conservative convention.
This former UKIP leader said that politicians should feel pressured by EU skeptics, at the same time as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham rally that Britain would leave now if Mr Farage was the leader of the Brexit vote.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the deep rift between her own teammates was made even clearer by the Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, joining other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep Chequers' agenda on track and is facing criticism from Brexit-lovers, anti-Brexit and the EU.
Allies claimed she would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing those who oppose Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and Brexit.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate in and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in government, we'd be out now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.'
He explained his opposition to the EU, saying: 'We did not fight in the world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own songs in our own country.
Mr Bone pointed to indications that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British public has changed its mind and wants to stay is completely untrue.'
Andrea Jenkins, a staunch Brexit supporter, was also at the rally, telling reporters: "I want to simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the public and the opposition will not vote for it, it uses unpopularity among our party members and activists who are out in the streets voting for us.
Do it, stop the Chequers program and start listening.
In a direct message to May, she added: "Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said that politicians would have to "feel the pressure" if they were to deviate from the decision taken following the 2016 referendum.
'It is now about trust between us - the people - and our political party,' he said.
They want to try to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them we will not let you get away with this.
He added in his message to the crowd: 'I want you to give your political party, which is failing Brexit, a chance to feel pressure.
We are activating the people's army in this country that won us the Brexit and we will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.
At the same time, pro-EU protesters held a march in Birmingham, which ended with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved the Conservative flag against Brexit after the group was formed over the weekend.
Adonis Low, of the Labour Party, made fun of the Conservatives over the security issues that had emerged in the party's phone app when the convention opened.
'These are the people who are telling us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a border without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,' he added.
This is a complete disgrace.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he said.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering a run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a frequent critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke meeting on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting in the form of a citizens' meeting with residents of her district since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she had considered running for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and lead our government, and then we also need a woman as leader.
Arrest following fatal shooting of Sims from LSU
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday that they had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, who was shot to death on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying a person who had seen the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told reporters Saturday, according to a report by 247sports.
Wayde came to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, with a weapon in his car, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2, Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the winning seat at the behest of their team.
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas took the lead over Lewis Hamilton in the Saturday race that orders from Mercedes would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and left Hamilton almost at the back as he defended his position in the first two turns and ordered Vettel to fight his teammates.
Vettel went first in the trench and let Hamilton drive into the lap at the end of the group, but that should have been able to decide the outcome.
The Mercedes went into the canyon one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton emerged from the race after a close fight in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside flank after risking being left behind, after a defensive attempt at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the team and was seventh at the end of the first lap, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race, only to have to change tyres to try to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He finally went into the pit on lap 44, but could not increase speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has been doing great all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me through.
"The team has put in a great effort to achieve this", said Hamilton.
It was a really bad physical torture.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her claim that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, alleging sexual harassment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but he did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "bad and cruel and untested".
"The only thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and angry and cruel and uncontrollable", he said.
When you see the exposures and the tattoos and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, would you like to see this?
You remember her answer... you're going to seal the document -- Oh, ha, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I'm not gonna paint it.
Now, just slow down.
"No, we didn't", he said, and he went after the senator.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh were revealed, and was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't cover up the charges against Dr. Ford, I didn't cover up her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to a report by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.
But her denial didn't seem to go over well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: "I'll tell you, it was really bad physical abuse.
Maybe she didn't do anything, but it was the worst physical abuse I've ever seen.
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, and suggested that Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power, no matter what means are used.
You see the cruelty, the hopelessness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to overthrow to get power and control", the president said, according to a report by Mediaite.
Elite League, Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants, and the rest of the league.
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game afterwards, 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were early two points ahead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home run, but Dwyer then came back to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then ensured their victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat of the season in the Elite League, having beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute at 3:35 p.m. after a field goal by Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford then came in with a field goal as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
There was then a lot to be had in the first few minutes and Sullivan brought the home side back into the game at 1:10 p.m. and Cownie then equalized after a 50th-minute field goal by Matt Marquardt.
Dwyer was able to get the Giants through before the half when he scored his second goal of the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home crowd rallied and Bouchard recovered for a goal when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second quarter.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen get Dundee over for the first time in the game late in the second quarter, and he secured his team's victory with a fifth goal when halfway through the final quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will take on Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller sacrifices his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he lost his life in an attempt to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tidal wave.
Large aftershocks continue to hit the area, and many are trapped under the ruins of the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, even though his colleagues had fled the control tower that was swaying violently at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was on hold to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely take off.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News of Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"We are very saddened to hear this", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed 1,000, while the country's wildlife agency says access is restricted to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the organization.
A six-meter-high earthquake has caused massive destruction in Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
The army and airliners are working to bring in relief supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with a body.
There is little clean water.
Small markets have been robbed everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to find survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation projects.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed over 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one missing after plane crashes over Loa
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed over a leak in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, after previously saying that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped the sinking plane.
Air Nine said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was not aware of any male passenger being driven off.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew after the plane crashed over the water as it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The Air Force and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had crashed into the airplane just before the runway.
Some witnesses felt that the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said that the plane's approach was very low.
"That was really good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to navigate the mid-water and make emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots were scared and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to repair a pier also assisted in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank in some 100 feet [30 m] of water.
Air Safety Authority data show that 111 people have died in PNG registered aircraft accidents over the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Nine.
Expert describes the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, a specialist from the U.S. Department of Justice, spent many hours in court as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to puzzle the journeys of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to his earlier claims, according to a report by The Clarion Ledger.
When records showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time he was said to have been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said it was an accident, because my car was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Telephone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted her text messages, phone calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He spent her out of his life", Hale said.
The defendants are scheduled to deliver their final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be heard later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to combat negative attitudes toward the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claims that hip hop originated as a political message and social issue.
They want to trace the origins of hip-hop back to the original and make it popular again.
Artists on board The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York City prosecutors sue a couple for rape after a "condemnative" text message
A New York City lawyer sues a couple for unlawful rape after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was a black person.
The couple, therefore, deny prejudice and liken the lawsuit to a financial scam.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed displeasure when she learned that her newborn, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first went to work in 2016.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, "the most unfortunate" Plasco-Flaxman, Mrs. Maurice, said that their former foster mother, who was a foster mother, had been in a bad way, and that she had expected to have a Filipino woman, according to a report in the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for damages for the breach, at $350 a day for the six months of work she was originally hired to do, although no contract was signed.
'I wanted to show them that this is not the way to do it,' she told the Post on Friday, adding: 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple have denied the accusations of prejudice and say that it was right to expel Maurice because they felt that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
My wife sent her a message she wasn't going to say.
She's not judgmental.
"We're not a judgmental people", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
But who would entrust their children to someone after showing proper generosity, even if it was surprising?
Your newborn?
Don't let it go.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to a financial scandal, saying that his wife had arrived seven months into the year in a "very difficult situation".
Are you going to attack someone in this condition?
"It's not very nice", said Plasco, who works in the investment industry.
The case is still pending, but the public has taken harsh words about the couple on social media, shaming them for their behavior and argument.
Paddington's publishers feared that readers would have difficulty liking a talking bear, says a recent letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the shoes of someone who first reads it before it is published.
It's very funny now that we know of Paddington's tremendous success.
She said that her father, who worked as a copywriter for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear, had taken the re-telling of his works with a more positive tone, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a "death-sacrifice" to his passing last year.
As for Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of the family", she added that her father had shown a sense of pride in his success at last.
"He was a very quiet man and he didn't usually talk", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something, and you're proud of that even though you didn't actually do anything yourself.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success at one time or another.
Although Paddington was his creation and imagination, he always gave Paddington himself credit.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When she arrived, her daughter had been transferred to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried their best to save her life, but to no avail.
"Nad called me regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive", said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up were gradually losing their effect and being excreted from her body.
She had died shortly before, and this was the body surrendering.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I could not cry or scream or cry, for I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who knew nothing of the hardships she was experiencing.
"No one knew anything", she said.
I nodded and tears came down all the time.
It's hard to explain, but while on the plane, I felt a great deal of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mournful women hang a suicide warning on a bridge
Two women who had lovers who committed suicide are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up a message on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers for people to call and get help.
Tyler, Mrs. Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son had been a successful cook with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said his smile could light up any room.
He ceased to work before his death, for he was thrust into a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler, then 11, found his brother dead after he had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there will be a demand for it".
Mrs. Davis created the message to let people know that you can go and talk to others, even friends.
Don't sit there and say nothing - you need to talk to someone.
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't talk about being sick or depressed or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his temper.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents he didn't look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his facial expression was a shock to them, but that they had to work through it: "This storm could have a family effect.
This is gonna tear us apart.
But we must persevere and fight.

The future of Britt Kavanaugh hangs in the balance. The FBI has its own investigation.
'I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for - a study with limited time and scope - we might be able to reach some sort of agreement,' Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "splitting" amidst the party divide where everything was in reverse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their fear is due to the timing.
With the midterm elections only five weeks away on November 6, if the Republicans do not fare as expected, it will seriously undermine their efforts to get their man elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has been calling Senators to urge them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, but she was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases their investigation report?
The Senate is scheduled to vote on the bill, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting as they are.
It's not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Number of people fleeing North Korea under Kim
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Council, said that 1,127 people had fled last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fees levied by people smugglers were key issues.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are invited to become South Korean citizens.
Seoul says that over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most flee to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross than the largely neutral zone between North and South Korea.
China views refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often forces them back home.
Communications between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have technically improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for discussions that focused on the postponement of the nuclear disarmament treaty.
This was after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed roughly to work together toward a nuclear-free Korea.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho warned U.S. businessmen of the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible that we unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons first", Ri said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "maternal illness" and said he was unfit to serve as a Supreme Court justice.
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in Congress, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "maternal illness", saying he was too creative to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made those words in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever left like that, she would have been called a maternity patient", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost yelling and getting a cookie in the throat when he discussed his family and his school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him "disgusting and organized human rights abuse" that was orchestrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because he showed bias toward Democrats.
"I think these allegations and the way he's attacked the Clintons and the Democrats show that he's unfit for the job", she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would seek to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats win a majority in Congress.
"I'll say this: if he's not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only unfit to be on the Supreme Court, but also the court he is now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now a judge on the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she would be concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion laws, where he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is no time for a morbidly obese, biased person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say, 'This is wonderful.'" Pelosi said.
And women need to use it.
It's a fair saying, months and years of heartache flowing out of it, and she doesn't leave without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she said that she cried when she got angry, too, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell her supervisor, "You might think I'm dead because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.
Anger is permissible in part because of a basic misunderstanding.
One of my clearest memories from my previous job in a mostly male office, where I started crying with a passion that I couldn't express, was an older woman coming in, grabbing me by the neck, and she was a cold boss that I had always been afraid of, and she dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're a ballerina.
They think you're a bat and they're happy to have you.
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign, but she was a Democratic senator from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught red-handed in a bidding war on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew his bid, Ms. Schroeder, full of resentment, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she told me with a laugh, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "White Mountain and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign long overdue, she was left behind in terms of fundraising, so she was told not to run unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not run, she was so overwhelmed with emotion -- gratitude to the people who had supported her, resentment at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focused her attention on voters rather than representatives, and anger at gender discrimination -- that she burst into tears.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown", said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You'd think Kleenex was my backup.
I remember thinking, what's going to be written on my headstone?
She was crying?
Why a U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were sharp, and although the war is far from over, trade between the two countries could be advantageous for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest step came this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin each time, recently imposing 5 to 10 percent tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has been reluctant to respond to U.S. tariffs, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to give up anytime soon.
To get Washington to jump, you have to make some concessions, but it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to publicly bow to the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing keeps up the good work, the pressures from the trade war with the United States could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the need for mutual support between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in either Washington or Beijing could lead to a situation that leads to an economic collapse in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, a researcher focusing primarily on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria prepares for the return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return willingly and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al Moualem, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, said the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to normalize the situation by building up areas that were created by terrorists.
The situation is now ready for refugees to return willingly to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic decisions that target their daily lives and work.
It estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million still living in the country are in need of relief.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would welcome help in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 points at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team, led by Danish forward Thomas Bjorn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling most of the race, hit his starting hammer over the water on the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has scored in all of his matches, becoming the first of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the bottom of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, the top-ranked golfer in the world, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup match.
Spanish eight-time Ryder Cup winner Sergio Garcia became the most successful European of the tournament with a career-high 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and it was a pleasure to be able to help", said the emotional Garcia after winning Europe.
He is correcting his country's John Rahm curse, but he defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-legged match on Sunday.
"I was incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an amazing result for one of the greatest players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the field, apart from Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk, after disappointing his team's performance, said, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
It was sometime in the morning that we pressed on Europe.
We lost him.
I'll take the top for Thomas.
He's a great coach.
All 12 of his players are playing very well.
We get back together, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we move on.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their leader.
You have to take the top.
They played better than us.
Recent news on the thornblossom: Density declines in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
The latest news from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the density of pine blossoms in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, weaker thorn blossoms are reported in certain areas in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating decreasing density.
The rainbow flower extends about 200 miles [200 km] along the coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee County.
Unique flowers can be found about ten miles from Hillsborough County, but in fewer places than last week.
There have also been reports of thistle blooms in Pasco County.
Moderate density in or adjacent to Pinellas County was reported last week, low to high density off the coast of Hillsborough County, very low to high density in Manatee County, very low to high density in or near the coast of Sarasota County, very low to moderate density in Charlotte County, very low to high density in or near the coast of Lee County, and low density in Collier County.
There are still reports of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory distress was reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
