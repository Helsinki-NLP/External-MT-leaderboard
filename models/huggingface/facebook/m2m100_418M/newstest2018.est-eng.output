Four members of the Kemerovo group arrested in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, the police in Spain have arrested the so-called Kemerovo group leader Slava Gulevich, who in the criminal world is known under the name of Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, detained in Spain, was arrested with court permission.
The court also arrested three suspects detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that they are members of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community between the ages of 27 and 57 who are mainly committing drug crimes.
In Mijases, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal community has been arrested.
In Estonia, three men were arrested as suspects, one of whom, according to data collected, is the leader of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected indicates that the criminal community clearly distributed tasks and roles.
The purpose of the criminal community’s activities was to deal with drug crimes and thus earn criminal income,” said Vahur Verte, the head of the pre-judical proceedings in the criminal case.
“We do not exclude that the number of suspects in the criminal case will increase,” the prosecutor added.
These are people who have also previously entered the interests of the law enforcement agencies, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that the cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been an important place throughout the investigation.
“International cooperation has become normal for us and this week’s operation shows the success of the cooperation,” Prosecutor Verte commented.
Ago Leis, the head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said the detention was preceded by an approximately a year and a half pre-investigation.
“In the first half of the week the long-term work was realised and we held simultaneously in Estonia and Spain in crimes suspected,” he said.
The law added that Central Criminal Police officers were assisted in his arrest in Spain.
For years we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and civil card forces.
These arrestations are another message to the criminals that we can get them from the other end of Europe,” Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that the suspects may continue to commit new crimes while they are in freedom, and the prosecutor's office therefore requested their arrest and the court also approved it.
A man detained in Spain is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In the context of the criminal case, property, vehicles and cash are detained to ensure the confiscation.
The preliminary proceedings are conducted by the Central Criminal Police Organized Crime Office and are conducted by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Slava Gulevich was sentenced to prison in 2005 and sentenced to five years in prison.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich from Kemerovo emerged in Estonia at the beginning of the 1990s when he began to deal with extraditions in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed tax drivers and prostitutes operating at various hotels and demanded a monthly roof tax from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscations of criminal income and rulings in force confirm the effectiveness of the fight against organized crime.
For instance, the latest judgments, the so-called Dikaev Criminal Community, separated from the criminal case of eight accused, from whom a criminal income of EUR 80,000 was confiscated, or the judgment against nine persons in the fact that Igor Aleynikov established a Criminal Community in 2006 aimed at illegal trade in secret cigarettes and committing crimes related to human trafficking in Eastern Viruma and Southern Estonia.
The amount of the confiscated criminal income is approximately EUR 71,500.
The success in these criminal matters has been guaranteed by the fact that the police exchanges information with foreign colleagues and the prosecutors proof every day, and if necessary, the actions are carried out together in any of the EU countries.
Civil rights group warns of traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people traveling to Missouri from the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP travel sign issued for the state of Missouri, which is valid until August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and missouri passengers to be especially attentive and extremely cautious when traveling throughout the state, taking into account the suspected racial-based events of the whole race, which have recently occurred across the state and are also presented here.”
According to the NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, both the recent Missouri law, which makes it harder to overcome discrimination cases, as well as the fact that the state law enforcement officials are in a large part targeted by minorities.
“People’s rights are violated.
They are pulled out of the teaser because of their skin color, they are tortured or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP Missouri branch, to The Kansas City Star.
“We’ve never received such a strong complaint before.”
This is the first such warning that the organization has issued about the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died in the early half of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got through the state by riding a benzin end and the Missouri police arrested him without being accused of a crime.
Additionally, the comment is referring to a recent report by the Missouri Prosecutor General, which shows that in the state, black drivers’ cars are stopping 75% more likely than white drivers.
“The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what may happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared, whether it means taking capture money or informing their relatives that they are going through the state.”
On the basis of the latest data from the FBI's hatred crime reporting program, 100 hatred crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, putting the state on the 16th place in the country's transition in terms of the number of similar offences.
Travel warning is also a response to the new law in Missouri, which makes it difficult for a company to appeal to a court for discrimination in search of housing or job.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona after these states adopted immigration laws that required local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU says it increases racial profile.
Usually, the Foreign Ministry makes travel warnings about other countries, but recently stakeholders have begun to use this measure as a reaction against certain laws and trends within the United States.
Hepatitis: What can everyone know about the various forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis or liver inflammation can be caused by five different - hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
The malignant cost, however, is chronic hepatitis B and C, which can further develop into liver cirrhosis, i.e. liver cramps and liver cancer.
Head of epidemiology of the Health Office, Kuulo Kutsar says that the signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, uterus, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, grey output, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and skin and mucous glands yellowness.
From the latest symptoms of the disease, the popular name of the liver inflammation is also derived from yellowness.
In children, hepatitis can go without signs of disease.
Different types of liver inflammation can be identified only on the basis of data from a laboratory study.
Acute hepatitis can pass to chronic hepatitis and go through decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver harmful disease.
Heulo Kutsar brings out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, by sex, from the outskirts of an infected person to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, entering the mouth and consuming drugs.
The risk group of hepatitis A infection includes family members and caregivers of the sick, people with chronic liver diseases, people who have sex with the infected, men who have sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented by vaccination, especially vaccination is recommended for many travellers and people in the risk group of hepatitis A.
Additionally, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before you eat for food.
Hepatitis B viruses spread by exposure to the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattoo, agitation, use of blood-contaminated residues (dental wheels, sprayers), donor blood, sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from the sick mother to the fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injective drug addicts, infected person's sex partners, men who have sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and caregivers, health care, rescue and police staff exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers travelling to countries with high hepatitis B infection.
For the prevention of hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people belonging to the risk group and in addition to people suffering from chronic liver diseases, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: abstinence from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure, other acetate and injections, tattooing and aging, and the use of a preservative in the event of infectious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behavior.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the National Immunization Plan in Estonia and is free for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread in contact with the blood of a sick person, injection of drugs, tattoo, agitation, use of blood-contaminated substances, donor blood, sex with a person suspected of hepatitis, and from the sick mother to the fetus/newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injective drug addicts, infected person's sex partners, men who have sex with men, infected mother's newborns, sick family members and caregivers, healthcare, rescue and police staff exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV-infected persons and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis C infection.
The preventive measures for hepatitis C are: abstaining from the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other acetate and injections, tattooing and aging, and the use of a preservative in the case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which multiplies in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses spread in exposure to blood and other body fluids, contaminated with them injections, sexually and rarely infected from the mother to the fetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B viral carriers and people who do not have immunity against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with a hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects a person from infection with the virus of hepatitis D.
Hepatitis E viruses spread by the fecal-oral way with drinking water and food, including low-heated animal meat, fish and seafood, donor blood, shared injections and infected mother to fetus.
Travellers may be infected in countries with high rate of hepatitis E.
The preventive measures for hepatitis E are the compliance with hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect your hands after going to the toilet, before cooking and eating, after the care of the sick.
Fruits and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little hot-treated animal meat, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water, and refrain from consuming drugs.
While in the last round the competitors tried to pull the four-time Olympic winner out of the line, the 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end and won 26.49,51 times.
Farah didn’t think long, pulling after the finish with himself to the line with his husband Tania and the children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the road with them was wonderful,” Farah told reporters.
Farah is the fifth in London tournament in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Everything is possible if you believe it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dame in Gold: Gustav Klimt's masterpieces, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait's extraordinary story" is immersed in the birth story of one artwork much deeper into the cultural life of Vienna in the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
More in the history.
It would have taken away, in a harder cutting paper, a narrow topic that would allow the portrait permitted in the title to be more influenced by the extraordinary story.
Now there are two books between them: the story of Gustav Klimt and Adele Bloch-Bauer on his painting "The Lady in Gold" and a much larger and wider history book about the respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads in the middle of the flourishing cultural life of Vienna, and who himself entered the Austrian capital, can at least be difficult to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around the Ringstrasse or how in the Central Cafe all the heads turned when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural artists was high in one of the wealthiest cities in Europe, and when you see a familiar name in the book, you feel like a grammatical more cultural.
But, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was acting in a city where the unhealthy syphilis was drowned and was the highest suicide rate in Europe, the story is like nothing to add to the development.
Or maybe even - even every pair of pincets add colors to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
By the end of the century, every 10 inhabitants of Vienna were Jews.
Adele's parents were also newborn in Vienna, but until Adele married the Czech sugar magnat Ferdinand Bloch twice and posed Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet did not pull all that glamorous life to which he was famous.
When looking at "Dam Gold", it's hard to believe that the end of life infected this great lady of socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait of his husband from Klimt, the last moment was the hotest painter in Vienna.
The order of Klimt at the time cost 4,000 crowns, a quarter of the price of the landhouse with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits the master's love story was suspected with the model, the sugar magnat didn't dismiss.
As for Adele, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist created during the work continued to the end of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - The Lady in Gold
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the beginning of the work with Adele, Klimt had visited the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravena, and the researchers believe that the glorious mozaics seen there gave the artist the idea to make a golden portrait of Adele painted as a mozaic.
Klimt presented his "Dam Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and approximately at the same time (in the years 1907-1908) was born another golden land "Cut".
Art historians did not leave the similarity of two women unnoticed.
What about Hitler?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I'm in debt to him to make his handwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist's departure (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before his death, Klimt had a new portrait of Adele.
Also in his testament (Adele left in February 1925) he asked his husband to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes to the Austrian Gallery.
He inherited his jewellery to his sisters Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austria Mona Lisa", 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, but fell through the drawing camera.
Although sometimes Hitler's later anti-Semitism is considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
Nevertheless, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in the testament of Mary had changed significantly until 1939 - it became important to find works that were favorable to the Nazi Party from the wealthy Jewish art collections in Vienna.
In Hitler's personal artwork, some of Adele's work at home was also suited, but not Klimt's.
Sixteen years after the Nazi art throw, a ten-year dispute between the Austrian government and the Bloch-Bauerite heirs began.
It should only be noted that if the "Cut" is seen in Vienna in the Castle of Belvedere, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dam Gold" must be viewed to ride to New York's New Gallery.
And before traveling to Vienna, read the above book.
Even if you're going to see Klimt's works, it's not planned, because at least my emotions turned around after the book's closure more Nazi and Jewish theme than the painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer sold for $135 million.
So not so much a portrait, rather a family fate story - and a very moving story.
The orientation of events was noticeably facilitated by the Bauer's tribe tree, which was presented at the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In advance, Gold was very close to its personal record of 200 meters behind, swimming 2.16,62.
The tipmark comes from a 17-year-old tide from a week ago when the time at the Canadian Junior Championship was 2.16,58, according to Priit Aaviku Swimming Blog.
It was the last one in the A-finals.
In the final, he passed a distance time of 2.15,76 and reached a good seventh place with a new strong peak.
From the Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15,13) the golden left a little more than half a second.
In the Estonian ranking of all times, Gold rose third, and its fresh personal top mark is the fifth result of Estonia of all times.
The Young Future is still starting at the Canadian Adult Championships at 100 m, 200 m and 400 m releases and 200 m and 400 m complexes.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championships took place in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there.
He won the 200m release with a silver medal time of 2.03.22.
It was the last time that this distance was swim by Estonia in 2008.
More rapidly than Gold over time, only Estonian recordwoman Elina Partõka has swim this distance in Estonia.
An Estonian who lived in Canada won the Bronx Medal in the 100m release with an excellent personal record and the new Estonian season's top-marge of 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swim this distance just one century faster.
He reached his personal peak in another 100 meters backward, receiving the opening of the notification in the letter time 1.03,69.
At half longer distance, he only reached the seventh place when he swim in the final 2.17,31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking on four different distances.
President Trump Goes on Vacation, Critics Breathe Teeth
The time of the holidays is on - that means a relaxation to the U.S. President Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the most vacation days taken by the president, critics are already screaming their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president plans to spend a 17-day vacation in a self-known golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the president's vacation began yesterday, the opponents of Trump have talked about the vacation for a week.
They give Trump a too frequent rest.
In fact, the president has the habit of spending a weekend in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
Of course, Trump has not been the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama is half less than Trump, only 21 days.
However, Trump has a tendency to forget things quickly.
A few days after becoming president, Trump said in his "60 minutes" message that there was no time for long holidays during his office, because a lot is to be done.
He also expressed anger over Barack Obama's leave three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to festivals and jazz concerts, ISIS is breaking the heads of the journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day visit to the golf club is not really a kind of relaxation.
This is officially referred to as a job vacation, during which Trump has no time to read or other attractions.
There was also another reason for the vacation.
In fact, the air conditioning system in the western part of the White House was replaced and the entire staff had to leave there.
The Oval Cabinet and other presidential workshops are also located in the West Bank.
"I don't think any of you would like to be in the West Bank in August when there's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioner," White House spokesman Lindsay Walters said, stressing that the president will continue to work during his vacation.
What President Trump will spend the next 17 days, you’ll see in the video.
Blocking Critics from Facebook – Don’t Candidate to the State Office if you don’t tolerate voter criticism
Our country's father knew so much about the unfavorable media.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn’t take a long time to get him out of everything from internal politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he did not force his critics to silence.
For in 1783, Washington said that “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and in darkness and silence we can be guided to the shadows by the sheep.”
This brings me to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
The Hogan subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who posted their opinion on his official Facebook page.
At the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) applied him to court.
Kuberner's officials blamed the case for negligence, and the online commentaries blamed the reactions in the style "Who's interested?".
“It’s just Facebook,” many said.
But that counts.
And that’s especially important when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a overweight democratic state.
His approval percentage is the second best among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthinking reactive thunderbird.
He has led the state in a firm hand and has remained strictly in accordance with his principles.
Furthermore, he has used Facebook as the main means of communicating with his voters quite fervently, presenting, for example, after chemotherapy for the first time, his thick head.
Thus, the blocking of people visiting the Governor’s page – a public forum with an official labelling, managed by the taxpayer’s dollars paid staff – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behavior in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing but moderation.
But it’s too easy to paint a picture of internet trolls, spammers, or people full of anger.
The Post spoke with a number of real people whom Hogan blocked.
And that’s exactly what they are – real people who communicate with their chosen leaders. teacher, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and at all not crazy.
The pastor cited the Bible in his post, emphasizing the Hogan Catholicism.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, a Maryland-based lawyer from Bowie, did not alarm anger, but real anger crimes.
"I commented gently that I'm disappointed because he has not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's news commentary.
“I also don’t like the idea that how many people comment on the same topic, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort, instead of acknowledging that it’s a large number of concerns with citizens.”
What the governor’s officials called a “directed spamming attack,” others would probably call “public support.”
The Facebook age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It’s much cleaner than ever before, when to do the same, it was necessary to send employees out to gather newspapers with critical guidelines and burn them or arrest protesters and force them to silence.
This is exactly what is happening, just digital.
Hogan isn’t the first government official to be criticized for making Facebook and other social media crazy.
President Trump has appealed against Twitter users who have blocked him from the Twitter stream.
One of the first significant judgments on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled in Alexandria that a Northern County Supervisory Council representative violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked a voter from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for the use of Facebook and Twitter by ACLU.
This should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, affordable postal costs had the same impact as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 the number of newspapers and anonymous writers quadrupled his way of leadership.
And even then Washington had to stick with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington’s decisions land.
According to historical documents collected within the framework of the online George Washington Letter Collection project, he buried the cabinet under petitions that criticized his views on the friendship, trade and shipping agreements concluded with Britain.
But he did not force them to silence.
Freedom of speech, disagreements and discussions are the foundation of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the Renaissance Club
Former European leader Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comfort of the home territory in the next three days, with the 25th Scottish Senior Open at the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern Irishman, who was leading the last round on the Archerfield Links roads in the neighborhood last year before his submission to Paul Eales, is enthusiastic about the new place and plays the role of the tournament deputy instead of club founder and chief executive Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club shines in full glory with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players see the track in their best form, it’s in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done great work in building this place.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game and feels what is achieved here over pride.
This allows the path to be perfectly presented.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to being able to defend the championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“It sends a very special feeling,” said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Open title because it was removed from my competition calendar a year later.
It is magical to come back.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of the past year, for me and my wife Sharon, the last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always be wearing in our hearts.”
At home, Gary Orr returns to the competition again, who joined the European Tour of the Seniors to the beginning of this year when he was 50.
This is his first event in Scotland after participating in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"Home playing is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburg's man Orr.
You like to play well, but you also feel an extra tension.
I’ve been very pleased to play again and showed a pretty good golf game.
I am satisfied with the current progress.”
The trio will be joined by the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and the senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottish players in the competition, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free and parking costs 5 pounds for the car with one passenger and 10 pounds for the car with two or more passengers.
All income goes to the charity Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
When Bardina Degei prepares dinner, she doesn’t use the plette.
He even uses the pot rarely.
In a wooden house in Enarotalis, the capital of the Panai Regent province of the Indonesian Paapua province, the mother-in-law puts the battal called the nota in the local language directly on the fireplace.
After half an hour, the empty mouse is taken from the fire and applied with unwashed hands on the skin.
Degei is sitting on a modest floor—there is no furniture—and there he also does his daily household tasks, for example, washing the washes with dirty water from the nearby sex.
The role of the walker is performed by a snake in a roofless room.
Since he is the youngest of his husband’s four women, he is not assigned to take care of any farm.
Polygamy is common here.
Late work, however, can be dangerous – most of the men in the village are unemployed and many of them are drunk hard, and there are still soldiers here.
“No one has the courage to go around after 5 a.m. in the village,” he says.
It is the former Dutch colony that joined Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, during which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote by lifting their hands under the eyes of the occupational forces.
The movement that pushed the Dutch liberation from the sovereignty towards its anger quickly against the government of Jakarta, which keeps the region still under its strong control, keeping foreign journalists and human rights supervisors away.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained the east part of the island.
Enarotali is an equally distant and abandoned place. To get here you will have to fly 90 minutes from the province's capital Jayapur to Nabires and then pass a five-hour journey with a rental car.
There is no public transportation.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo taras and covered by wave iron roofs, whose roses have made different shades of yellow brown.
Very few Indonesians have taken the journey here, not to mention the journalists, as well as almost no foreigners have visited here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago popes worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We didn't get used to wearing such clothes," says Degei, referring to his colour sheet to a hand-covered turban, a dark plus and a bright shirt.
“Before, we had only plant leaves on our body.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty limit, and infants' mortality and insufficiency statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also the gold-rich land of Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153,000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mining in the world, Grasberg, which belongs to the company operating in Phoenix, Freeport McMoran.
Only in 2015, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer beverage stocks worth an estimated $78 billion.
But these wealths are the source of suffering of the popes, as they are the cause of the sophisticated presence of the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study by The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and military units, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The efforts of the popes to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden tree, and they are unlovedly traveled around.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 papaya have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass murder in the 1970s in the mountainous lands belonging to the Papua tribes was the measure of genocide.
Last year alone, more than 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
Birsbane's 2016 report "We're losing all" contains testimony of the cruelty committed in the previous year, such as non-judicial murders, torture (a second report says rape and electric shock are common) and the cruel suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“The number of victims is difficult to summarize because such incidents occur every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The crops are even more strongly shut down because the natural resources of Papua have caused the flow of new beasts from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but the demography is changing as the populated Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi come from Muslims to economic migrants.
The family food stores sell the gado-gado with crocodile and mixed vegetables, served with a pot of land.
People cannot compete with them.
“Migrants began to sell chicken and vegetables on the traditional market at a cheaper price than local potatoes,” explains 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Panama, who moved for work to the province’s capital, Jayapura.
“Therefore, the popcorns — the popcorn moms — lose their market share.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known among the people as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former gunman, on his way, won the presidential parliament in Jakarta in Paapua 29 of the 27 electoral districts, including Paniai.
But the Paapuas has very little changed and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi in the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes regarding the restoration of justice," says You.
In fact, Pania was worried only two months after Jokowi took office in October.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children sang Christmas songs near the fire in Enarotalis when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on the motorcycle from the darkness.
The bound children told them they should turn the front lights into.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers took the children behind and caught them with their hostages.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was hit so cruelty that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election committee building was burned and the next day the things escalated further.
Approximately 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered for justice to the football square in front of the local police station and the military management center.
They carried ceremonial hunting buses and presented the Paapua mee pago tribe waita-dance, during which they ran around and walked the bird song.
Some protesters began to scratch the stones of the police and the military.
"If the mass shows more than three times resistance, let them go," according to the official document, which has been seen by the magazine TIME, but which has not been published to local media.
Jeremias Kayame, the elders of the city of Enarotal, Kego Koto, felt a threat and called for peace, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left arm,” she told the magazine TIME in her bright colors at the veranda of the woodhouse.
Kayame is still unknown who the shooter was, but says the moon came from the rows of the soldiers gathered.
“There was a lot of people, there was a lot of people,” he added.
A local man, Alfius Youw, said his grandfather had seen his shooting three times.
“I was running to him and examining his body to make sure it’s with him,” Yohanes told TIME, who uses only one name for many Indonesians.
“I saw him dead... I kissed him.”
Papua police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his subordinates only guaranteed the security of his department as it was attacked.
“We have to defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the police in Papua in 2015.
“It is a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the murders arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that occurred in Papua.
“I want to resolve this case immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism for the resolution of committed criminal offences against human rights.
But apologies were followed almost immediately.
“Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The thing is that we are committed to resolving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes,” he said.
Speaking to the newspaper TIME on June 5 in Jakarta, Wiranto rejected his words, saying that he had no intention to create a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything is resolved according to the law.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of violating human rights crimes in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor during the bloody independence referendum in 1999, said that 11 human rights crimes have already been resolved in Papua, including those that occurred in Panama.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with dark shame.
“I’ve been heard four times over the past three years, but no progress has happened,” Yohanes said.
“I’m tired.”
He says he lives years later still terrified.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
"I'm afraid that the army will arrest me, I'm afraid that I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Pania are afraid to resolve this incident.
He said he had been killed by the army after he had helped the four victims to be buried.
“After the funeral of the dead, the army came to look for me,” he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shoot the village in the neighboring region of Pania, Deiyais.
One man was killed and 17 injured, including children, when he went to a conversation between the village residents and the building manager who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in fishing into the nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s office on the building site.
According to the police, the village inhabitants scratched the police with stones, on which the latter responded with warning calls.
But, according to local claims, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting the people, killing one person.
"We were in great panic, we're afraid of revenge," the 29-year-old Dominggu Badi told TIME, who lives near the hospital and has seen the wounded on the inside.
“I’ve been hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament has urged the police to take responsibility and the police to withdraw the mobile brigade from the area.
Panama has always been a problem for the Indonesian government.
The lack of thought of development feeds the dissatisfaction of the honey, monia, dan and damal tribes living in the paving middle land of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) – the Army of the Massais, which, according to itself, defends the rights of the papas by organizing accidental attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army’s “protection for the protection of the sovereignty of the state” in recent years has arrested Pania and arbitrarily held thousands of people.
Some of them will never appear again.
Among the Papua people, the Pania is known as a “tragical forgotten place.”
Poverty causes dissatisfaction.
The small rice that is sold in Enarotalis is too expensive to buy for the locals.
Bread is unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves—mainly batata, in addition to a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women, each of whom can take care of four or five bats.
They usually keep the majority of the yield to the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten batates will only cost 10,000 Indonesian rubles (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality has been worsened between the native pops and new migrants, who have reached a large number since the opening of the new airlines at Nabire Airport.
These few jobs that exist are going to better educated and wealthy migrants.
The paapuches themselves often do not have the capital or the skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from the Pope.
Furthermore, there are severe restrictions on foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from the Pope because "they didn't follow appropriate practices", although they were given a rare filming permit.
Phelim Kine, Deputy Chairman of Human Rights Watch’s Asian Department, said Jokowi’s election promises to eliminate the restrictions on reports to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
“In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the most eastern unreliable provinces of Papua and the West Papua are threatened by new threats – a visa refusal and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
The lack of a brilliant look at the journalism means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to the nearby neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries – Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Salomon Islands – were encouraged by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “a number of widespread crimes” in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These countries have also historically supported the VPL.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Arrmanatha Nasir, removed the group's accusations, saying to the journalists in Jakarta: "Indonesia still has a democratic order and freedom of speech, so the evidence of human rights violations would be difficult to conceal."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the state’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurat on May 4, the local people interrupted their silence, according to a source who was in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, urging: “We want freedom.”
New presidential elections will be held in 2019 in Indonesia, but the popes do not believe they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to make Jokow understand that in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under the threat of the wicked army, they are troubled because of Nigel's education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like other popes, consider the vote given to their Jokow to be the debt that they must pay.
“They don’t need money, they want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and fears, the families of the victims of the Panai shooting were able to take the last symbolic counterfeit—they buried the dead body of one of the victims in the opposite land of the police department and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on foot, they don’t let at least the guilty forget their crimes.
“One of our family members was killed,” says Yacobus with a head dropped.
“What else could we do?”
Fire burns Dubai Torch cloud for the second time
The fire broke through one of the world’s highest residential routes in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 337-meter high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has destroyed a high building in just two years, which is called the Torch, or Tõrvikutorniks.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were and no direct cause of the fire was.
"We slept and woke up on the fire alarm and the people's screaming.
We ran down the stairs and we took about 10 minutes to go down from the 50th floor,” a resident who called himself George told Reuters.
According to Dubai Civil Defense Officers, firefighters deleted the fire around 4 a.m. at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they are working to ensure the heads of the victims.
This incident could again raise questions around the world about the safety of materials used on the outer surface of high buildings.
During an investigation conducted by the Torch Board after the 2015 fire, it was found that the most damage was suffered by the facade - outdoor decorative panels and insulation.
The British police said they believe that the London Grenfell Tower isolation and facade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
Watch: These phones are likely to get sales hits in autumn
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for tech fans, because then telephone manufacturers will unveil their new top models.
In spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale, and in autumn, new hit phones are expected for the pocket.
According to Tele2 Marketing and Sales Director Kristjan Seema, these years the flag is characterized by innovative design, mirror scanner, edge-serve 4K resolution screen and ultra-speed processor.
A great excitement was generated in the technology world by Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the forefront of the Estonian smartphone sales table.
The autumn will allow smart enthusiasts to have even more remote fast charging, more durable battery, higher quality camera and greater water and dust resistance.
He added that on the basis of the reports, we can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to conquer sales patterns these years.
These four top smartphones models will arrive on the pocket in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are expected to reach the pools in mid-September.
The rumors, however, what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it, spreads a lot.
If the iPhone 7 did not bring significantly big differences alongside the iPhone 6s, then on Apple's 10th birthday, the new model is expected to be completely different from the previous ones.
There are four colors: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably the screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple’s design manager JonyIve calls for the new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been a talk about the ceramic version of the iPhone.
In addition to the eye scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
This is one of the most anticipated smartphones in the year.
The pre-order of the new Galaxy Note 8 will begin on August 23.
There is a lot of news about what the new Galaxy Note 8 will look like.
It seems to be designed for even more business users, and the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one of which is a wavelength and the other a teleobjective with a narrow field of view.
Nowadays, no one knows what the two back cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung’s first test, which is definitely quality comparable to the iPhone 8.
We look forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones this year in front of Nokia 6, it still lacks their flag ship, Nokia 8, which will be presented on August 16.
We look forward to Nokia’s 5.3-inch end-to-end screen and an extremely fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
Nokia also talks about the aluminum corpus and a significant level of water and dust resistance IP68.
Similar to Samsung, the new Nokia model has two back cameras produced by Zeiss.
Since Sony’s firm flag has so far been XZ Premium, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future, at least two smartphones will be added with even more innovative features.
We look forward to a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
Sony’s new model is speculated that the screen is at least six-inch.
What the reality brings, we can see soon, since traditionally Sony has revealed its autumn flag on the IFA International Technology Fair, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to transcripts of telephone calls, Trump pressed Mexico on paying for the border toll
The Washington Post has revealed transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders.
On January 27, Trump called for President Enrique Pena Nietole to stop the public announcement that he will not pay for the proposed border measure.
The U.S. President broke the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You should not tell the press."
Trump set his presidential campaign on the promise of building the wall along the U.S. southern border and swore that he will make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first speech with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul were also published, which revealed a tensionful exchange of thoughts.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. takes on refugees to Australia is "smiling", "smiling" and "smiling."He claimed that the agreement made during Obama's government would leave him a "manager" impression as he has proposed a ban on refugees to the U.S.
Trump ended his speech, telling Turnbull that it was "the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not take into consideration the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna in the case in which the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the purchase of bus lines from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order with which the offer was rejected by OÜ MRP City Lines at the Tartu bus contract because the offer did not meet the requirements, said Anneli Apuhtin, head of the Tartu City Government Law Service.
This is the contract for the public transportation in the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines appealed to the State Court of Tartu District Court's decision.
The court did not proceed.
Though many people complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disrupts their nighttime and the whole city is full of drunk celebrations, there are many people who do not have a bad word to say about the festival on the beach.
I’m even positively surprised that the celebrations in the store were so friendly!
I didn’t see any foolishness or disappointment.
I’ve even seen kindness,” says the wicked Laine.
“It’s a good thing to come, to be, and to know the joy of the Pearl, which is in the winter as the winter sleep remains,” he added.
The nightmare of the beach doesn’t bother.
When he lived in the city center, he still heard that music was played on the beach, then now the music has not yet reached his home walls.
“But I hope I’ll hear,” he says gladly.
Agnes, who also talked with the Evening Site, says that the big festival is rather good for Pärnu - it will greatly contribute to the movement of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that so many foreigners have visited the summer capital.
The noise of the woman does not interfere.
Even though I’m no longer sunny on the beach, it’s good that the beach is revived.
And it’s good that the people are moving and that’s already three times,” the woman says.
The first time was a bit worse.
“There may be any complaints,” he thinks.
But the noise on the beach, he said, is common for the summer captains.
“This weekend is a very good promo for our small town,” says Harri, who is in the park.
Melo and Melo have not even hit his life rhythm.
And what about?
We should all keep together.
Consider how this inter-national communication would be better.
The voice of the musician does not mourish.
It doesn’t bother, though I live nearby.
“Good people can save and there’s no disturbance,” he says.
His guests said they were kind.
“With the bottles, of course, they’ve too exaggerated a little, but the young are young, and the Lord God – let me go, but be people and we can do it!” he says.
The residents of the coast have traveled somewhere away, either to relatives or acquaintances.
“But in general, the festival affects life positively – people like such noise,” says Tiina, who walked with the children of Pärnus.
Even her family's dream festival music doesn't bother, although last year it was even further than this year.
Last summer the show was different, so we heard more.
We live out of the city, that it is actually quite good at the far side of the Pärnu river,” he says.
Pearson will cut more than 3,000 jobs and reduce dividends to revive the business
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediates by 72 percent, thus launching another restructuring program to address the threatening business narrowness.
Losing jobs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are likely to be dismissed at the end of 2018 and early 2019, will add to the 4000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in the third cost reduction program to try to revive the business that has become a momentum due to the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell a share in the company last month Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann, said their expectations in relation to the year have not changed since sales revenues were 1 percent growth to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
The summer weather will continue with rainfall on Sunday.

Attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber, according to officials, attacked a military convoyer in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
A NATO statement said five soldiers and a translator were injured.
Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians were killed in the incident in the district of Qarabaghi.
This bombing is the last of the violent attacks that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomb killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion took place on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked "with a human-made explosive body".
According to the statement, all the injured are in stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (ISIS), the growing force in Qarabaghis NATO forces in Bagram are a serious concern.
According to the UN, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people, mainly in the Shiite district.
The Taliban said they were behind the attack.
A massive bombing on May 31 killed more than 150 people in the city centre - this is the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S.-led troops withdrew the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence emphasizes the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. troops helping the state's military and police.
According to the correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and especially President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA repealed the decision to delay the order after the lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has repealed the decision to delay with the Obama-time regulation, which obliges the states to restrict the emissions that cause collapse, one day after 15 states appealed to the agency for this action before the court.
The EPA announced the decision to continue the “2015 Ozone Assessment Operations” late on Wednesday, saying it shows the agency’s commitment to cooperation with the states.
“We believe we have to dialogue with our state partners and listen to them,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that the EPA intended to postpone the determination of the ozon content — which will measure the pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where it should be reduced in order to meet the strictest air quality standard — by one year further to October 2018.
15 mainly democratic states, together with the District of Columbia, submitted a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations established by former President Barack Obama. according to Trump, this is part of a wider growth marketing plan.
But these efforts have caused contradictions among Democrats and Nature Conservation Groups, who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website writes that the inhalation of ozon-containing air "can decrease the functionality of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," for example, the asthma.
The German pigs can come to a party.
Germany’s pigs and cows may come to a party as strong rain threatens the second-largest European breeding producer’s harvest, reports Bloomberg.
This year it may go so that week-long seedhood before the seed can mean that the wheat intended for the bread industry is only suitable for feed for animals.
“The quality of the dust is far worse than the soil and worse than in 2015,” said Agravis Raiffeisen analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of the German beef can go to animal food, which is twice compared to the usual, Agravis predicted.
German farmers as well as their European colleagues have been exposed to any weather this year.
In the beginning the winter was too dry.
Then came a cold spring, which in June was replaced by a hot wave.
In July, Germany hit the sajuhood, which has continued in August.
Many’s eyes are turned to North Germany, where the rain prevents harvesting.
Until now, only 5 percent of the grapes have been harvested.
Most of the region has not yet begun the harvesting, the local harvest saviour Ceravis said.
"There are quite difficult days in the hands," said Ceravis' old merchant Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Compatible with all Finnish interior designs
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the exhibition houses, because through the large windows, the untouched views of the coast of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
On each step, our northern neighbors are trying to create both harsh and perfect (energy-efficient) houses at the same time.
Respect and follow is deserved by the Finnish ability to use wood as construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products.
Incredible approaches and intelligent solutions can be found in the exhibition houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
There it is obvious that black, white and gray shade compositions, if supplemented by wooden tones and room trees, can be very atmospheric.
Good ideas can go on for another week, as the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and herbs indicate that this kitchen is cooked frequently.
This night, the line was drawn down to the Weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix did everything to remember as the last actor.
The people were really turning at the time of Garrix's appearance - they were singing, crying, dancing self-forgettable.
When Garrix finished, the protein was spread from the beach to the city as a joint mass.
We’re bringing you to a gallery with all the pictures that our photographer tried for the weekend for three days.
You are also among them, look for yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go to the encounters in the nearest toughest boxing match up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council's lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome Lomachenkot, the World Boxing Organization's lightweight champion.
After the victory achieved by Garcia's unanimous decision over former four-time world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, the two fighters are in the first place of the weight score.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How are you going, champion?
I wish you success.”
Lomachenko will defend his bands against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 a.m. at ESPN.
When a couple posed for the photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that the possible confrontation between the fighters would be a "perfect measurement".
“I’m an ex-blind,” Garcia recalled.
“I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg to], but I’m not so big.
I am 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down to lightweight.
And he has to move up to lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans wanted it.
Let’s offer them that.”
Lomachenko has agreed.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
This is part of his strategy that he wants to let Lomachenkol debut in a class of 61.2 kg by the end of this year to make it possible for the next summer to meet with Garcia (37-0, 30 NOKAT), who are also interested in fighting with the winner of the match between Jorge Linarese and Luke Campbell after their lightweight title round in the Forum on 23 September.
"Seeing this fight could be paid because fans have wanted this confrontation," Garcia said, later saying that he is open to fighting any channel that offers the best financial package.
“We are the core.
No other name can attract so much attention.
Whenever they are ready...”
Garcia said he considered Lomachenko a "powerful fighter" and could go to watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest to praise Garcia, saying that he thought the three divisions champions from Riverside seemed “very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this to be a nicot.”
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the striking strength and then play poker.
Both confirmed that they feel how the tension to seek prosperity between them increases.
“This is a struggle that awaits realisation.
No other confrontation will bring so much attention and suminity.
I’m more than ready to work for this,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is just that.
It will be a good fight.”
Which parts of the world are moving?
The Polish and Border Guard Authority (PPA) has extended and issued a record of more than 13,000 residence permits to third-country citizens who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
If, for example, the country was determined to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, then the hourly residence number was 4928.
The authorities don’t know how many immigrants will eventually stay permanently in Estonia, but such an analysis is prepared by the Ministry of the Interior.
If about 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year 10 years ago, then in recent years this number will begin to reach close to 2000.
The number of residence seekers increased drastically during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier, 675.
According to the Statistics Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia is increasing, with more than 850 Ukrainian citizens arriving in Estonia than they left.
“The Ukrainian community has always been great in Estonia, and because of the complex circumstances in the country it is natural that jobs and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many also family are already in front of it,” said Kristin Rammus, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry.
The number of Ukrainians granted a temporary residence permit was greater even than the number of Russian citizens, although the total number of temporary residence permits issued to the latter in the last ten years.
If the Ukrainians come here for a majority of work, then the citizens of Russia for family.
"Given the historic Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, a migratory scientist at the Academy of Internal Defense.
“When you look at where Estonian residence permits received Russian citizens have moved to live, then immediately after Harjumaa is East Virumaa,” he added, adding that about 40 percent of them have been married to a citizen of the European Union.
Mullu received a temporary residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians seeking to extend their residence permit has decreased.
“The shock is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia,” said Rammus, a spokesman for the Ministry of Internal Affairs, who said the interest of Russian citizens in the residence permit in Estonia has remained more stable for years.
Foreigners who have lived here for at least three years can apply for a new residence permit from the previous year.
It aims to encourage adapted people to stay here.
The residence permit for a long-term resident requires five years, for example.
As a result of the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit is also likely to be reduced.
For example, such a residence permit was granted to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can exchange jobs and the Estonian state is no longer tracking whether the salary criteria is met.
This residence permit became attractively popular - the applicants were still gray passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
The residence permit was granted in 1968, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese citizens.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Over a decade, Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are one of the most active Estonian residence seekers.
If in 2007 three residence permits were issued to the Nigerians, then I am 200.
They are going to study at the universities in Nigeria.
Moreover, Estonian higher schools are popular among the Georgian, Chinese and Turkish.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to learning migrations.
It also applies to them the rule that where the community has emerged, there is easier to get to others,” Rammus added.
In the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have arrived from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If approximately 6,000 third-country citizens receive a residence permit a year, it is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if you think more EU citizens, migration remains about a percentage,” Maasing commented that in fact the numbers are small.
In total, according to the statistical agency, 14,822 people migrated to Estonia and 13,792 out there.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of immigration.
Most of the expat and entering are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among the expat.
Therefore, the migration saldo of Estonian citizens was at a minimum of 2,000 people.
The Estonians migrated primarily between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's Princess Mode Admired with Sats, Ticks and Tolls
For Maria Tammeoru, however, there is a story - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream somewhere in the museum for hours and admire ancient strawberries and cracks.
If you do something with enthusiasm, you will explore and learn about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery.
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem a lifelong one, but the designer doesn’t think so.
You decide how much bright it is in your life.
I have a girlfriend with a whole sauna filled with my created hole couture dress.
For it’s not her fault that she doesn’t live in Hollywood and doesn’t go on a red carpet every day, she wants to wear the most beautiful clothes and even wear them!
You can live your life in a special way.
The fashion artist does not recognize the gap between bright events and the grey day.
It was this thought that made the plan to bring high fashion in Estonia to landscapes, between forests and farms, to people to whom fashion often does not reach.
The Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võrus, Rõhvis and Pärnu Fashion Hall, where the 45-model royal defilee filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, you are often taken in the poos, digested with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - they scream braavo, rise up, want to thank you in a handful way.
A lot of the audience came to update, but now they’re a fan of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people’s expectations, they’re inspired!
And I like the feeling that I'm with my fashion as if I'm on a summer tour.
We had a 50 meters long red carpet, a whole street full of beautiful clothes, it seemed that they didn’t come to an end!
Maria also does not admit that the creation must be presented to a supermodel, she likes to bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my clients to the stage - they’ve always come with joy.
This is a wonderful experience, you can shine on the stage in a wonderful dress!
I’m so sorry that I’ve never seen my performance, I’m always behind the stage to give the hopeless perfectionist the last slope to things.
My nerve would not allow me to look calmly from the hall.
Mary is the creator of this kind of fashion, who wants not only to perform the role of representation, but to be in everything.
I have my machine in the studio, most of the collection I do myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, you discover.
I’m never far from my work and I’m not afraid of work.
With design, the thing is not limited, also stylism, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to be enabled for one temperamental woman's day.
This is a huge challenge for the fanatics.
I can't say when my working day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I’m still very lucky – it’s like an endless happiness chain: I’m doing something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful, and yet, in turn, compliments.
How many times it has been said that my clothes have magic - they make yourself feel like a princess.
The charming crazy satirates that made Mary's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: Estonian subgroup tournament weapons now turned against us
Sorry, the story is over.
The first thing that I saw was that we couldn’t get our table.
And if there’s such a big difference on the table, there’s nothing to do,” said Estonian U18 basketball men’s 61:75 defeat to the UK, our only basketball player playing in the NBA, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and resulted in so much more attacks.
We were also not ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created .
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we were unable to build up the defence.
In defense, they were able to hold between hands everywhere, we couldn't combine.
This hit the team's legs down.
The homework was better done.
Myrsepa estimates that Estonia should make more tactical mistakes in order to remove the opponent's eos.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received several fast baskets.
Athletics and the narrow peak, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now turned all against us.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The wall was happy with his careful Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the whole team, until today there was a uniform hit rate.
It is a shame that such an aggressive opponent has not been met before.
Tass has always been confident and played out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried a pretty big burden.
But he did some of the very beautiful movements I’ve seen in the workouts before,” the coach added.
Strong numbers: The basketball team of the girls scored less than 10 points in three quarters in the EM tournament...
In the U18 age class, not only the B-division basketball tournament for young men will be held in Tallinn, the girls began overnight in Dublin.
The game with Poland, unfortunately, was an anti-record game.
Estonia lost 25:65, but even after the third quarter, it was 9:49 or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took foot from the gas pedal and that period remained 16:16.
In both the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, in the third 1 point.
In the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two pieces from the first four shots, then 25 pieces from the game, then one into the three, and then another 21 shots through the game.
Per in a half hour one of the 47 whiskeys was hit.
In addition, there were 2 points out of 4 releases.
The number of deaths was reasonable at that time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland was 33 and Estonia 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, on the opening day it was to recognize Portugal's 83:56 superiority.
NATO ships arrived in Tallinn to supplement stocks
Today, NATO’s 1st Permanent Mining Anti-Group arrived in Tallinn for a planned port visit this weekend to complete the ships’ reserves and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships make preparations for the return to the sea, giving the crew members the opportunity for a couple of days of vacation.
After the visit, NATO ships will stay in the Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be prepared for future historic explosives search operations.
“The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they carry out in the local waters is a good demonstration of our integration with the Allied forces,” said Arto Reinmaa, Chief Commander of the Operations and Planning Division of the Navy.
On 29 June, NATO’s 1st permanent mining group will be led by the Latvian Navy captain Gvido Laudups, who took over the mission of the group head at the ceremony held in Riga from the Estonian Navy officer captain Johan-Elias from Seljama.
The flagship of the group is designated by the support vessel of the Latvian Navy LVNS Virsaitis, which also operates the group's lead staircase.
This year, the international unit is also composed by the Estonian Navy Minijahti Sakala.
One of the four ships under the Nato Navy Headquarters is the Nato 1 Permanent Mining Anti-Group, a preparation unit among the first rapid reactors, which the Alliance can send to different places in the world within five days.
From 4th to 13th August, the ancient treasures of the Pirita Monastery will again become a place where the Birgitta Festival is held 13 years ago.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to Tallin Philharmonic Art Director Risto Joosti (36).
Risto Joost: The listeners reach the classics of the opera world include "Traviata" and "Tosca", ballet discoveries from the exciting "Bolerost" to the fun "Karlsson" and also no lack of the plan of self-production, which this time is Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratorium "Years" directed by the same international creation team that in 2015 brought Pirital to the stage Haydn's second masterpiece "Creation".
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre shows.
It’s bigger than any musical theater in its usual form.
This is a festival whose excitement takes power and never leaves it quite open again.
For the experience that the listener gets in this upper and mysterious environment makes the human souls sound and touches the human senses in a way that is impossible to describe.
Risto, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Did the master's different class shoes not seem a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with the Special Class, it has helped me a lot.
He directed me through all my student career and also supported me at the beginning of the leadership career.
Per this is why it will make it easier for me to continue his work.
The different Class has injected so much goodness to the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, it’s all over me too.
It was great to join a team who knows how things are going.
The great heart of Eri Class also gave me the power to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in the Tallin Philharmonic.
And here I am now and I can do it!
What can the audience encourage this year, what special do you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise, the first ballet written by Astrid Lindgren is presented.
That’s why Karlsson is flying.
And one curious nuance in this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed the desire to write this work.
He has probably had Karlsson's character in his soul since childhood.
Christine, how do you do this?
Thanks to my supporting partner.
Such work requires a system of support and a lot of love, and I’m fortunate to have it with a set.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend so much on other people, as much on myself, or how I face every new day.
And such conscious keeping the tone, keeping the positive, and actually smiling to myself in the mirror in the morning, significantly raised my happiness.
Especially now this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it especially sharply and it works.
Smiling to yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
This is not just a word.
I think people don’t know much about their bodies what the universe offers them, but everybody finds it slowly.
Soon, an important moment is in place.
Do you have any rituals before entering the director's board?
We need to change clothes for more comfortable.
This is a little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don’t have the opportunity to rest or make a little sleep before a big show.
In fact, I even like to actively communicate with people, even before entering the dirigent party.
But come all to the Birgitta Festival, here's what to discover even for not a great friend of opera and ballet!
Watch the video of Risto Joost!
New results of the age assessment tests for Swedish asylum seekers
In Sweden, a test was conducted among asylum seekers, during which their age was assessed by a new approach in a medical way. The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as older than 18, but at all not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing by the beginning of this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of the age of the asylum application after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to correctly determine the age of several allegedly minor refugees.
Currently, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Institute of Judicial Medicine has issued a total of 2481 test results from the middle of March 2017 to July 31.
Eighty percent (2002) were estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the Institute of Judicial Medicine estimated that the tested "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person was "probably younger than 18".
Tests are used only if the age of a person is under questioning.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Judicial Medicine, the results are consistent compared to the previous months.
"We don't see a big difference compared to the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The fact that the majority of cases were considered older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that 442 cases "have indications that the person being studied is 18 years old or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 test results, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to get 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, through which X-ray images and MRIs are made from the wisdom gums, and then they are allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticized in some areas.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include evaluating human biological maturity to find out whether they passed puberty earlier or later than usual.
"I've had reason to think about it and I don't think the measurement method used now should be used.
Determining the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say with certainty, then we should not make the face that we can,” he told the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Judicial Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of disintegrating a child into an incorrect adult is small.
The highest risk at about 10% is if a person is slightly under 18.”

20 year old Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut at the World Cup in London, getting a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was the youngest winner of the World Cup and the happy woman confirmed she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The match went well and I had a good experience.
With the first test (64.80) I made my average outcome immediately, in the second (62.80) I risked too much and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear,” Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions and I am very pleased to find it.
Anna Maria Orel's World Cup debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rainfall didn't interfere with Orel because he's training through the TTU stadium in the winter.
“I’m crazy,” he said with a little bit.
At the London Olympic Stadium, there was almost a full house of people, did Orel realize people around him or could turn off?
I realized, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says that it will add – that’s what it is!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be happy with the debut of the World Cup and he’s waiting for a lot of good competitions: “I came here this year’s 32th season, the last result, I ended in the 18th place.
This is a very good result.
I’m 20 years old and I’m the only one that counts.
I have a good experience and I want to compete for medals in some days.
Governor of West Virginia announced a party exchange
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on a meeting with President Trump on Thursday that he would exchange parties.
“Like it or not, but the Democrats walked away from me,” Justice Governor said.
“Today I’m telling you, having prayed and thought a lot...Today I’m telling you, West Virginiaans, that I can’t help you as a democratic governor anymore.”
In the gathering there were pleasures.
“So I’m going to be a Republican tomorrow,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play another game.”
Trump had previously promised a big announcement at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, proved to be elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and the coal business he owns from his father.
Its value is approximately $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) issued a statement on Thursday evening that "Cuberner Justice's party exchange is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from becoming better again than to work for it."
"From all 15 governments and control over the lowest number of states in history, the Governor Justice's statement is just the latest discourse to a party that is led from the end to the end and can't find a positive and connective message," RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News.
It is not surprising that where there are many people there are also many injured.
On the weekend, Urmet, who was in the office of the medical league, told the Evening page that they had to share a lot of plasters.
Villas and marshmallows are basic, out-of-the-counter and light falls.
Of course, also headaches, back and leg.
According to Urmet, the visitors come to the festival with the wrong footwear and so the problems come.
Doctors have also had to help a couple of visitors with a greater injury - there have been some panic attacks and also one foot turmoil.
We’ve also made bite when a person has broken his hand or finger.
The small ones are made here, the big ones are sent to the hospital.
Look at the video if the celebration doctors are also asking a pain cure for pohmelli treatment.
Coe apologizes to Russia for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, an international narrator of the lightweight team, said on Thursday that "Russia's honest apologies" for the doping scandal, but repeated that it was not time for the country to return to the sport.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, a Russian lightweight narrator, said at the IAAF congress in the eve of the lightweight world championship that the competition prohibition imposed on his country is correct and that he has a certain goal to fight doping.
He apologized to "all lightweight players who have dropped gold and silver medals in the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of putting into force the competition ban, which was introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-backed doping in Russia.
“I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
"The Healthy Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Alliance also acknowledged that they have had quite difficult times and they are doing everything they can to restore the Alliance."
Coe said he was also pleased that Russia accepted its recovery criteria.
“I believe that today was a very constructive day and there is progress, but Congress supports the work group’s proposal that it’s not the right time to withdraw Russia,” Coe said.
“We have to do everything we can in the next few months to normalize the situation.
We’ve always rely on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the broken system,” he added.
Nine of the Russian lightweight clubs, which meet the strict IAAF criteria, will compete as neutral athletes at the lightweight world championship in London on Friday.
IAAF’s working group chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia did not meet a number of recovery criteria yet.
Following a report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping controls are still insufficient and that banned coaches are still free.
The electric car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Few of the fact that the electric car revolution significantly transforms everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
While mining giants like Glencore can say that from one place they win and lose, the smaller mining companies don’t help.
Currently, Glencore serves steel and oil, but in the future, in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, wax, aluminium and nickel will grow.
This year, the UK, France and Norway’s governments have decided to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels over the coming decades.
As a result, Volvo has already announced that it plans to give up the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring to the market a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars will be sold over the past two decades than cars that use fuel from oil.
"As for some metals, it changes everything," said Capital Economics' raw materials analyst Simona Gambranini to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on such metals as cobal and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
Electric cars have about three times more copper than usual cars, Glencore said.
More copper is needed in charging stations, so Exane BNP Paribas estimates it will increase the demand for copper by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric cars batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalts, graphites and manganese.
Glencore will get revenue from the growing trend of electric cars from the rise in prices and the fact that it is the world’s largest cobal manufacturer, Jefferies Group predicted.
According to the broker company, the other winners of the electric cars win are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is reacting to the already changing trend.
This year, the London Metal Stock Exchange has dropped 70 percent.
The price rise was 37 percent.
The price of copper has also increased by 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore’s stock rose 20 percent in London, overcoming rivals of Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo-American.
The losers are on the side of plays such as Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main final use of the lead is the batteries that power the starters of cars with gasoline and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium ions.
“This is a serious risk for steel demand unless other purposes are found to overcome the decline in demand,” said Michael Widmer, head of metal market analysis at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of the price movement of the pipe, the influence of the opening trend is not yet noticed.
This year, the bly has increased its price by 17 percent, making it the best metal in London among the main industrial metals.
Investors will see problems with metal only in the far future.
“I’m not sure that it’s so bad for the pills, because cheap oil keeps the conventional cars competing,” said Herwig Schmidt, sales manager of the Triland Metal Co., Ltd.
If the demand for lead decreases, it occurs slowly.
This may happen in about a decade.
Until now, however, the stricter emission standards mean that the increased demand for hybrid cars, which are dependent on plumb-based batteries that are developed when engines are frequently launched, is assessed by the international plumb and zinc research organization.
Light metals like aluminum replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This explains the additional 1.6 million tons of aluminum demand for 2013-2016.
It accounts for 2.7 percent of the world’s total aluminum production.
This trend is likely to get worse, Widmer said.
The price of aluminium has risen by 13 percent this year, as the growing demand by automotive manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers don’t sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce stunning motorcycles.
Also, ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop a lighter welded steel to resist the aluminum minimum.
"Superpowered steel should be a response to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to the platinum.
About half of this precious metal was used to catalyze cars with a diesel engine, metal refiner Johnson Matthey said.
“Many of the high-powered raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have high demand in the future,” said Natix’s raw materials analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but their importance changes over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe the continued demand for diesel hybrids.
Uncore’s chairman, Marc Grynberg, said more hybrid cars will continue to be sold than full-electric cars by 2025.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the next 10 years is the Toyota Motors and Hyundai Motos developed on hydrogen-based cars that rely on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas Brunet.
German automotive manufacturers took part in a major decline in July as a court in Stuttgart banned the use of diesel in Mercedes-Benz and Porsche’s hometown.
How Football Financial Rules Affect Neymar's Transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing uncontrollable spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from the Spanish football club Barcelona to the French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from the UEFA, the management body that governs the European Game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament, are still ahead of Paris Saint-Germain.
The Fair Play Financial Rules (FFP) established by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove that Neymar’s transition was funded without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) solely for the Brazilian to buy out of his contract, and Neymar's salary begins to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transfer of Neymar to the French club.
PSG is undoubtedly able to make such money out to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-righteous line, considering that the team is funded by the dominant family of Qatar's energy crash.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot on the recruitment of players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their own in the football industry.
The FFP founded Michel Platini after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs who fall into big debts in search of success actually deal with fraud and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners should give up support.
Since 2011, the FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of club debts.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a potential club and then make large spending to make the team better and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period of the FFP, which lasts until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was shamefully withdrawn from the presidential office in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excess spending.
"FFP is not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is the UEFA FFP observer, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG paid for the Neymar over-sales clause as a single total expense, they are able to divide that amount for accounting purposes into parts throughout the contract’s duration.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, making it possible to show a transition fee of €44.4 million for the next five years.
With the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, along with Manchester City, belonging to Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties.
PSG was charged with a fine of €60 million (currently $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team for the 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to overtake regulatory financial institutions by spending their revenue through club owners-related companies.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority’s PSG support was exhausted.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar's PSG service could come from Qatar through the payments of the 2022 World Cup Organization Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar in 2022 deny that Neymar could become a world championship ambassador, and claim that UEFA regulatory authorities could easily reveal such a maneuver.
The sanctions previously imposed on the PSG mean that the UEFA is even more cautious with regard to any attempts to disregard the rules.
People familiar with the situation said on Thursday that the UEFA has not discussed the transition of Neymar with the PSG in a preventive manner.
They talked to The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in the 2015-2016 season with a turnover of approximately 542.4 million euros.
The last financial year data has not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar’s arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
The club expects a turnover increase of at least 30 percent in connection with the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the greatest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG breaks the FFP.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs primarily to Qatar.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Sports Magnat, shares La Liga’s attitude that the country is funding the club.
"This is a consequence of property rights and it has completely changed the entire football landscape over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of an honest game, as the country may have other ways or interests to represent the country by such a great player.”

Today, 50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia, which broke roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which flooded on 6 and 7 August, caused great damage especially to the Baltic Country, Harjuma and Raplama.
In northern Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m/s during those days.
My old man walked in the garden from one tree to the other and tried to support them with his hands.
It was dark and dark, like the end of the world.
The roofs were already flying from the houses in Taama, the old sister, Linda Kurova Haapsalust, recalled in 2002 in an interview with the Estonian Nature magazine.
Linda's husband saw her own planted garden collapse.
But what do you still support the trees with your hands, where can you face such a storm?
The sea came under the window, the water sprinkled in from the windows,” said Linda, who lived in the Haapsalus Kalda street at that time.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and the roof of the perron of the railway station had been flying 20-30 meters away, Linda saw the majority of the hassles similarly only the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were in a loose on the ground, some completely long, some half.
Everything seemed very depressing, the storm went through the beautiful old trees with ragina and pragin like a war.
West Virumaa could not suffer especially severe in the August storm of 1967 compared to West Estonia, but the losses were also large there, Virumaa Teataja wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Lossipark and Padise park were celebrated from land, but also our candi parks were heavily suffered.
In Tallinn, the wind was measured at a speed of up to 35 meters per second, which is about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the night of the 6th August in Tallinn, a little boy was screaming: “Mother, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can’t go down anymore,” Virumaa Teataja wrote.
The building of the Põlli palace, located in the plantland, was destroyed during the storm so much that it was decided to collapse later.
The Augustitorm was not resisted by the Türi ski-hoppemäe structures, which later were no longer restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star newspaper wrote that the recovery of cities and settlements from the damaged trees and their shells is progressing slowly, and the inhabitants could contribute to the recovery work.
Furthermore, fruit farms suffered from the storm, and the newspaper that “party organisations must be an incentive and guidance in both organizational works and fruit exploitation.”
Hurricanes can be spoken if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The wind record in Estonia remains from November 2, 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at the wind speed of 48 m/s.
On the island of Vaindloo, the meter was broken, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The Secret of Clean Swimming Pools: Night Cleaning Works and Bad Beach Light
Coldest summer weather also means smaller cleaning difficulties in Tallin swimming pools.
“When there’s no time, there’s people on the beach, and if there’s no time, there’s no people,” the beach cleaner says.
On the Strom Beach in Northern Tallinn, kajakes rise.
They are offered by a melodic competition by a low-wheels throwing tractor, which throws down the tricks on the plague.
In fact, the last seven centimeters depths through the sand, harvesting out of it seafood and humans’ abandoned cracks: bottles, cigaretets, and more.
People still come to the beach, regardless of whether the water is warm or not.
If the weather is good, people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Alexander Usov, head of the Haabersti Administration coastal cleaning work.
It is at 6:30 a.m. and there is a hard cleaning work on the beach, because at 8 a.m. the square must be well for people.
We are at work at 4 p.m.
In addition to Stroom, he keeps his eyes on the Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaare Pikakari Beach.
The amount of waste has decreased.
Years ago it was much more.
People are already able to evaluate what is done for them,” Usov says, who has cleaned the beach for 15 years.
Before it was so that when something new was put up, it was broken the next day.
Now what is on the beach is kept.
Clean Beach Price
One of the greatest works on the Estonian beaches is the cleaning of the sea shrimp or the adru on the shore.
For example, on the Pirita beach, 400,000 tons will be transported during the beach season.
“This is an incredible amount,” Usov notes.
The second major category forms a living gap, or everything that people leave away.
There are eight large waste containers on a half-kilometer Strom coastline, which need to be empty three times a week.
There is so much waste.
However, the coldest summer weather has meant that the waste is a fifth less than otherwise.
The third kind forms the abandoned things.
Most of them are children.
This time, a dozen models have been pulled out of the usov sand.
These remain the owners waiting for the bridge that leads the beach.
"They usually come out more, but this is a normal harvest." Usov already knows that soon he will find them again inside the sand.
The children come to the beach and take the toys to put them in the sand again.
Waste is dispersed
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haaberst’s administrative services, acknowledges that the tractor’s cutting work disrupts the local people.
The noise, which lasts from night hours to early morning, blends the dream of people living in the neighborhood.
Today, this work is impossible.
In one month, the beach must be crossed twice.
“If we don’t do it, the city will punish us,” Scholler notes.
But the goal, like Pirita, Pikakari and Pärn, is to get the Strom Beach under the international blue flag quality label.
“In comparison with Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are kept,” Scholler says.
We have more adru and stones, and it is harder to wrap the sand.
There is less waste on our beaches than elsewhere in Europe.
Hearing that the beach is talking about waste, Martin, who lives near the Strom Beach, unforcedly enters a conversation between journalists and recyclers, highlighting the current narrow places on the beach.
In the morning there is a picture everywhere.
The problem is with the birds and the bottle creators who have dragged the waste pockets in a rough way,” Martin says.
Although it is difficult to assume that people will be able to change their current behavior habits, Martin hopes that the municipality will do something with the waste bags and put them on cover, for example, to prevent at least the birds from rebuilding there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Strom Beach.
The city is taking care of it.
With children's outlets, lighted and fresh asphalted teas, it has become more pleasant.
It was once that the rollers could only run on one road,” Martin notes.
Wallet finds in Stroom: coins, only coins
From the morning the measurement period has come to use the 40-year-old Dimitri, who as a treasure cammes the coastal value with a metal detector.
He does not believe that he will find anything precious today or in the future.
The gods are not good enough.
“I’ve been doing this for a year and have not found anything valuable so far,” Dmitri says.
As a hobby card, Dmitry's treasury contains some euro coins, bottles, and also dangerous pounds, which later throw into the rubbish.
Usually there are coins.
“Golden, rings and other things are usually not available,” he says.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to be informed that interest rates will remain at the previous level, as unpowerful growth and inflation relief have milded speculations regarding the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain stable as households’ pizzable revenue has placed interest rates to expect.
The policy makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6:2 for keeping the rate at 0.25% and fewer members call for a rise this month as slow growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast to 1.7% in 2017 and its 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household income will continue, as inflation is still expected to rise to close to 3% in autumn.
However, the bank also pointed out that the rise of interest rates will be necessary to counter the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that the financial markets may need a higher loans rise than expected.
The members also voted a year ago in favor of the partial withdrawal of the mammut package that was marketed out of the economy as a result of the Brexit.
The bank will terminate its deadline funding scheme in February, offering cheap funding to banks, although it said it is now expected to offer a 15 billion pounds greater offer, which is 115 billion pounds.
In the Protocols to the Decision on the Rate, the bank says: “In the MPC average forecast, the GDP will remain in force in the near future, as the severe situation of real income of households will also have an impact on consumption in the future.”
As for the amounts, it was repeated that to mitigate inflation, it is necessary to "tract some tension on the monetary policy" and to "a bit greater" as the markets are expected.
The stock exchange is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and the second rise in 2020.
However, the bank emphasized that any kind of jump is gradual and limited.
The bank’s reduced growth forecasts for this and the next year are comparable to the May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The 2018 1.8 percent growth forecast remained.
After this news, the pound rate fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators that have undermined increasing hopes for growth — GDP rose from 0.2% to 0.3% in the second quarter from the last three months.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will begin to accumulate a slight pace.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave a little reason to rejoice the households suffering from the rising inflation and the poor wage rise, saying that the situation will get slightly worse before it improves.
It was added that the monetary policy cannot prevent a hit of income over the next couple of years, but at the end of the three-year forecast, a significant recovery of wages is expected.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which will partially compensate for lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the interest rates were lowered by 0.25% in August after a shocking EU referendum, which led to a sudden weakening of the pound.
According to the bank, it is likely that it will take four years to fully absorb the prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, it was to feel the growing demand for a rate increase as inflation had increased pressure on narrow households; in July, three policy makers demanded a rate increase to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was anticipated and is expected to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that the excess growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Coreco’s head of mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: “Given the recent decline in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems favorable to those whose current transactions are beginning to end, as refinancing, often free of service fees and low rates, has become increasingly popular.”
NHS is writing out to 10,000 people a controversial HIV drug
Patients have access to "transformative" HIV-preventive treatment since September after a struggle held in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should fund the drug.
NHS England that the National Health now makes the initial three-year clinical trial available to an estimated 10,000 people for pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) - a tablet that is administered before sexual intercourse and which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection in people with high risk by approximately 86%.
The NHS agreed to fund the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court’s last year’s ruling that the NHS is able to pay for the PrEP, despite the authority’s own claims that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
NHS England’s chief executive Simon Stevens welcomed this Thursday announced move as a “new extensive intervention”, while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as a “reversal moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the program will be rooted everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among people with the risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that a person’s body has a sufficient amount of certain medications to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or not later than two hours before intercourse.
The suitable candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
Clinics will identify suitable people who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner cannot receive antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wishes for participation at the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England signed an agreement to get drugs this week after an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the drug is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new extensive intervention should complement and strengthen a wider and increasingly successful fight against HIV spread.
This is another step in the fight over more than three decades against one of human health’s greatest problems.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT, said: “This is a turning moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted correctly to those who need it and belong to the risk group, offers an opportunity to change the UK's HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk in England will have access to a powerful new tool through this NHS-financed clinical trial, which is individually managed and not dependent on negotiations with a partner, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “Now it is crucial to ensure that clinical trials across the country are rapidly postponed and that no HIV-risk group belongs away.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been purchased, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people with the risk of getting infected with HIV.
Public Health Deputy Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very delayed after months of delays and the government’s leg sliding.
The evidence shows how big changes this medicine can lead to HIV prevention and the end of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial leads us a step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is taken over to the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and bring us a step closer to the stop of HIV spread in society.”
The price of electricity rose 12% in Estonia, while in Lithuania and Lithuania it fell.
In July, the stock price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania fell to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros this June, Elering said.
The main reason for the price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish community faults.
In Estonia, the average exchange price of electricity was EUR 34.33 per megawatt hour last month and the price rose by 12 percent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price dropped by five percent to €36.27 per megavat hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34.17 and the system price of the Nord Pool electricity exchange was EUR 26.37 per megawatt-hour.
The prices increased by 12 and 7 percent respectively.
Electricity moves between Estonia and Finland at 75 per cent of the hours last month towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not negotiate the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, the electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia for 99 percent of the time and for 73 percent of the hours the total transmission capacity was in use.
According to the transactions held on the last trading day of July, the price of electricity on the Nasdaq OMX market could be approximately 34 euros per megawatt hour in August and 37 euros per megawatt hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide that affects the price of electricity was rising last month and the transactions took place at a price of EUR 5,04-5,47 per tonne.
High Living - Half-storey and smart design tips have made this small Earls Court apartment a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, an ex-banker, who is a passionate real estate renovator, replaced her big Knightsbridge home with Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and sold the apartment over is a declaration of respect for the new design.
"Before, I lived with my former life companion in Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," Joanne said.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high boxes.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 93-m2 apartment has passed a complete renovation course.
At first it was a single bedroom and a complex layout apartment - to get to the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-storey to take advantage of the high layers.
“I wanted high layers, big windows, a lot of light.
These were my demands,” he said.
He hired the Duck & Shed architecture and design studio at Notting Hill at Erfan Azadi to take advantage of the 3.8m high layers and create a home that would not be just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The hole was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-storey where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
“The metal structure is quite complex,” he explains.
“We had to reorganize the rooms so that they were located on each other, without having to worship.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to make the height of both the upper and the bottom rooms right.”
This setting allowed Erfan to create two full-high rooms in the room with a lot of dramatic elements.
From the half-storey, it opens from the old copper light to the glamorous living space under the view from the Retrouvio window.
The mirrored gold furniture, silver details and the retro-angle Serge Mouille's lighting highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrality, spacecraft and light emptiness.
There are mirrors attached to both ends of a short corridor to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the back wall with a mirror leaves the impression of the window that opens to the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cab offers a storage for all Joanne's dishes and glass dishes.
The living room adds the charm to the opportunity to close the kitchen part if it is not used, creating the imagination of a more glamorous room.
The kitchen is nothing new.
However, in this kitchen, the unique fact is that it is a type of garage lifting door.
“There was a bit of design trouble,” Erfan explains the door from the MDF spooned with steel strength.
"It has a resistance, so it slides very easily when it is rejected."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 additional space meters, an additional bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"At the end, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to the real estate," says Erfan.
"The reservoir broker enters the room in an outdated form and makes calculations based on the floor surface."
Here they have been able to increase the floor, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are what you touch and which thus help to create emotional connections with the home," says Erfan.
“You don’t love the electric cable on the wall.
It’s important, but it doesn’t make the tongue of the heart sound.”
This shows that good design and enlarged area will help make a pretty ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they can actually cause the desire not to leave, as it happened to Joanne.
The main character Dane Jensen is a Chicago cloud shooter who competes with a colleague for a job enhancement.
There is nothing more than a earned amount of money, along with which any ethics is forgotten.
The man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first half of the film, I think it’s a version of the “Carthouse” business world – even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler’s speaking style are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the cartoon element remains, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers begins to appear more and more.
As a life-changing experience, the main character becomes the child’s illness of cancer.
There is a choice between work and family life.
The son who dreams of the architect’s office makes his father walk to the big buildings of Chicago to think of really important things like faith, goodness, love... without touching even the Twin Towers catastrophe.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, the feeling that the filmmakers are based on the goal of the audience will definitely get to cry, because even the most crazy-hearted spectator can't keep the tears back when he sees the suffering of a loving cancer boy.
When the son falls into a coma and his situation seems hopeless, the father will finally understand the morality of his work and do a good thing to the old man looking for a job.
Now I mistake my mind about marriage with myself - if the film has a happy end, then I premise my passivity after the film with coffee, but if I mistake, then the screenwriter can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there is a doubt that the rest of the coffee is missing - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the man turns slowly along the corridor toward the palace.
The son, however, is wonderfully healed, and although his father has just lost his job, it also seems positive, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can also feel good - I can predict the end of the American drama already quite well!
In honor of the truth, the film is well designed, all the necessary elements are available.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the morality is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I think this film will be good.
Trump's new head of staff plans to limit the presidential media consumption.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do that really.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico writes that the new head of staff of the White House plans to limit the information flow to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the head in more flat water.
Here is the broken reporter Josh Dawseylt:
“When the new White House staff chief John F. Kelly met with senior officials on his first working day, he brought out the key problem in the White House of President Donald Trump, which he planned to solve – getting bad information into the presidential hands.
Kelly told officials that information should be passed through her, either on paper or on meetings, because the president would make better decisions if he was given good information.”
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have also tried it, and they have failed to tighten Trump with monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back for decades and even now that he is in the White House, his TV watching habits have not gone anywhere.
“When the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media update, it was worth showing him that he was reflected honestly in the influential publications,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politicole in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at that time that "six former campaigners said that the key to Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is stable and also a praise song."
good is.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter use habits have ever been “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaigners know something that the rest of us don’t know—that Trump’s calls would have been even more burning without their intervention.
We will probably never know about the tricks that Trump did not post.
If his assistants were able to save him either a few times from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from constantly triggering controversy.
One part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people exclusively try to promote their own interests by sending Trump material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the course of the story, wrote in May about the tendency of counselors to feed the president with strategically questionable information.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The current and former Trump subjects say that Trump can react to negative press, especially with a harmful impact on the information chains, explosively, taking the obsession to identify their source.
The same happened at the end of February when someone damagingly gave the president a printed copy of an article on the website GotNews.com of the internet provokator Charles C. Johnson, accusing staff chief deputy Katie Walshi of being the White House "a source of many information".
It doesn’t matter if Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter because of a complaint, or he has not provided any specific evidence, or he has also made false accusations in the past and rejected them.
Trump read the article and began to inherit the subjects about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that at the time staff chief Reince Priebus and White House chief Rob Porter "has tried to establish a system for managing and documenting the documents arriving to Trump."
How did it succeed?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same three months later.
Per he will be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad don’t get permission to appear.
There are a lot of foreigners in the city of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Page got to talk, acknowledged playing in the Old Town without the permission of the municipality.
First, we found three street musicians near the Viru gates, who had taken with themselves the same number of dogs.
It was clearly seen that the musicians with roastpats and explosive clothes were backpacks, for whom one shower would cost a bear away.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played the story with a fun rhythm at the accordion, while a man alongside him jumped with three balls and called the passengers closer.
The third man was sitting next to them on one backpack and smoking the heartbeat himself prepared rounded plate.
These three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the past people.
Noem, who played the accordion, and Bob, who played the balls, said they were playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's performance was to collect the ticket money on the ship that was traveling to Finland on the same night.
Asked whether they asked the city for permission for musicing in the Old Town, Noemi and Bob broke the heads.
First, we didn’t know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or a couple and mostly are given promises for a month or something like that.
There’s no reason to pay for it,” Bob explained.
About 20 minutes later, when we came to the Viru gates again, we saw two women standing with the musicians and pushing them to go.
The company moved with backpacks and dogs to the crossroads of the Viru Center to try happiness.
There were also three young men from Poland on the Viru Street, one of whom played violin, the other played klarnet, and the third had a lot of electronic piano.
“We’re here to provide people with entertainment, to spread music and joy, and to make money for fuel and living,” Trio pianist Mivosh explained.
Mivoshi said they are aware that the city government must have permission to attend.
“Naturally we don’t have it,” he said joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, then there is no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we’ll go elsewhere, but we have to try,” he added.
The Estonian Bank purchased bonds for €149 million in July in the framework of the Eurozone Central Bank’s Public Asset Purchase Program, while the central bank’s debt portfolio increased to €4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish any more detailed information about the purchases.
The President of the Estonian Bank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to the consultation of the National Assembly members that the Eurosystem’s asset purchasing plan includes three different purchasing programmes: financial sector covered bonds (covered bonds), asset guaranteed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank acquires bonds from the market to encourage investors who sell bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Under the effect of purchases, the lower-risk asset productivity decreases and it motivates investors to take greater risks.
In general, within the framework of the public sector debt purchase program, each central bank purchases national government bonds, other country bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian state has not issued bonds, the Estonian Bank makes so-called replacement transactions within the amount allocated to them.
Substitutional transactions are also made by central banks in countries where the supply of bonds in accordance with the purchase plan is limited.
The Estonian Bank, upon Hansson’s approval, generally acquires bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
The Estonian Bank will purchase bonds as part of the Asset Purchase Programme from March 2015.
Meanwhile, Elering bonds were also purchased, but since June 2016, the Estonian Bank no longer purchased Elering bonds.
In the name of the central banks of the euro area, the Finnish Central Bank will buy both Elering and Estonia Energia bonds from June.
Migrants ignore the cravate and return to the “Millionaire District”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have again fallen into an angry confrontation with decisive migrators who have neglected the council's complaint to win back the field away from their villas.
Travellers have parked their 20 trailers in the field as a wealthy "Millionaire District" near the crossed Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children, and trucks after they were only thrown out there in May, without allowing themselves to be mixed with the cravings that the council was crawling to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weak place in the defence boundaries, pressing their vehicles through the uninterrupted part that was left for foot.
The inhabitants of Maruvihas have shaken the Solihull council, saying that the council is "unusual to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday evening after they were expelled from Bentley Heath, where they wrapped passengers with stones.
The committee must be ashamed that they begin to act because they are useful in dealing with the problem.
Migrants were there in May, they were left and now they’re back again.
They came yesterday night, and probably more today.”
He added: “Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by getting long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the road to Streetsbrook and I’m not happy to have to continue paying the general tax if the council can’t even prevent such a thing.”
One local resident, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said: “This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these routers left, and a new attack is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even been seen remembering a horse.”
A representative of the Solihull council said: "We are aware that the land near the Streetsbrook road is an unacceptable campsite, and we will cooperate with Solihull police. We will implement the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
The collection of evidence is very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling at number 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court if we present the case to them.”
The weekend festival will be visited by the Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring true world top names.
Asked why the Weekend festival is so important for the Estonians, Saar replies that it should be asked by all those who enjoy the three-day festival chat in full breasts.
However, it is clear that there are genuine creators who have arrived in the area.
"With this level of artists that have been able to bring to Estonia, then that the absolute top names of this music genre are brought home - this often does not happen in our wear," says the Minister of Culture.
Which festivals are the most performing artists on the island?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old men like me, it is one of the most experienced artists Armin van Buuren who got up yesterday night.
According to his discourse, we all have turned our feet at some point,” he says.
But he’s still bringing out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian creators: starting with NOËP and they can be read in a whole series.
In fact, this concentration of known names is very high,” he says.
Take a look at the evening video.
Audi renews up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism
A day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer software improvements to more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to BMW’s chairman, the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including BMW’s hometown in Munich, which have considered the ban or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will renew three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel engines emissions.
No company described these operations as refusal.
European automotive manufacturers have encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide that is released from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
Furthermore, the cost of equipment installed to neutralize gas emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive enterprises will increase, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
While the German automotive manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the federal chancellor Angela Merkel government is also accused of delighting powerful automotive manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid the repeated errors of Volkswagen, who silently stopped the so-called use of fraud, which allowed the emission sample to be adjusted to the regulations during the car testing, but pulled back in the usual driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been charged in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics subdivision of the Audi Motor Development department was arrested in Germany.
Former Chairman Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore is not protected from extradition and may go to court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi in Germany was trapped into a criminal investigation against Volkswagen when authorities accused Audit of installing the system in order to shake away from the European emission requirements, thus expanding the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could be a big challenge for Volkswagen – the luxury car manufacturer generates disproportionately a large portion of Volkswagen’s profits.
The European Union flag will be purchased for €20,000 to Estonian schools.
The Ministry of Education plans to buy EU flag for Estonian schools by 1st September.
In total, 570 educational institutions will receive the European Union flag of 105x158 centimeters.
Flags are intended for exhibition in the interior, they must be performed in high-quality printing techniques in the interior, also with tunnel approval, the ERR news portal mediates.
The flag is labeled with the text: "Give the Estonian schools for the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The cost of 570 flags is estimated at the education ministry’s price of 20 000 euros, which means that one flags will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes growing threat in Mexico
The weekly Riodoce staff usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa that is sowed by organized crime, corrupt officials, and uninterrupted drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their safety.
They are told that it is important to change their routine.
Two parent journalists are discussing which one feels safer: whether to bring the children to the office, which was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on the table in front of the room: "enemy", "neutral", "allied".
They ask reporters to offer the names of each column—no evidence is needed, enough impressions and inner sensations.
The government or the cartels are suspected of being paid to drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists—a whole list of evil people who make the reflection of the dominant chaos in Mexico dangerous.
According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since President Enrique Pena Nieto was appointed in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been under state protection after attacks and threats, and at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states during this year.
The last dead include their editor and inspiration source, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence gives a deep sense, although his presence can be perceived everywhere – on the facade of the Riodoce building lies a large picture of the middle-finger Valdez with the letter “Justice” and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-signs with a picture of his smiling face with glasses or a characteristic panama cybara.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death. Reporters discuss common trauma, their horrors, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate public prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to address the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists said only two cases were brought to court responsibility.
As with the majority of the annual drug trafficking and organized crime-related murders, the number of which reaches thousands, the murders of journalists rarely come to court.
The Riodoce edition will continue to reflect the violence in Sinalo, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data of the murderers and justice, Ibarra said the security meeting would not benefit much.
“It’s very stupid to waste your time on this meeting,” he says.
“Until the reason is unknown, you’re shaken all.”
Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the state's capital Culiacan on the morning of May 15.
He managed to drive just a few quarters before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla. He was forced to get out of the car and he was shot 12 times. This is expected for the name of the newspaper, which means translatedly "the twelfth river".
The armed man drove to Valdez's car and caused an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
A woman and two adults were killed.
The stories spread freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, mainly, there is silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and its extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields, because rival clips are fighting for the fulfillment of the power vague.
It doesn’t matter whether a few people or a few people are thrown down on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the dead garden is covered with abundantly decorated two-fold narcotic kings’ mausoleums that are larger than the houses of many living.
Let’s forget for a moment that peace time indicates that with valuable ports and narcotic routes to the United States, the submarine state is driven by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, Riodoce's co-founder and CEO Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels huge guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that the murder was promoted by two errors.
The first of them was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a cartridge-click narrow man competing with Guzman’s sons, in February.
This post could rage the boys—the suspicious members of the jury bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they arrived in the newspapers.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security purposes after the attack took place in another news release that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad and his murder is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues supposed that he would exist forever.
He worked at the newspaper Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling shares for $50.
Bojorquez said that in Sinaloas "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the narcotic problem."
The newspaper gained awareness over time with its courageous and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters liked publishing powerful research without fear of censorship, and readers were scared in a print from which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabote Prize for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists (ACC) for his courage to follow Mexican narcologists everywhere it leads.
He openly acknowledged he was afraid.
“I want to continue to live,” he said by receiving the ACK prize.
Last October, he told Rompeviento TV in an interview that drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinaloa.
“You have to take on the task that is accompanied by the press office—the second option is to be foolish.
I don’t want me to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn’t tell what was happening.”
Riodoce collective lacks Valdez, a joke man who ropended like a mattress, a friend who gently shared embuses and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He was always wearing his cabaret.
He passed the way from the office to the El Guayabo bar and always sat on the same table.
Now they’re asking if his routine love became fatal to him.
His death has also led them to question themselves how to do their work best and stay alive.
“They don’t like to travel with their women, their children, their legitimate, their secret landing sites that are used to transport drugs.”
“These things shouldn’t be touched,” said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, strong self-sensure and self-sufficiency.
Confidence in your instincts.
If the thing smells doubtful, keep away.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is that “the sensation of the heart can be deceived... and that’s what happened to Javier.”
He and others say that the old rules in Sinalo are no longer applicable, just as they are not applicable in Tamaulpas, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states that are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
Landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff gathered for security training, suddenly mobile phones were no longer permitted; a few days before it, it was revealed that only government-selled malware was used in Mexico to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two police officers were searching for a relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of a tree.
The government ordered them to oversee the Riodoce office, which is located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacani.
Some reporters have been wondering about whether these police officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers whose governor himself has disbelieved.
Several months have passed since reporters have travelled to mountainous lands where control is de facto in the hands of the narcotic forces.
Riodoce this week's edition addressed three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former box legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinalo.
In addition, they had a revealing story about the government’s money spending on the governor’s hometown.
And a group of people were stolen from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacani, a quarter away from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement about who was stolen or how it happened, so we had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows – the restaurant is a favourite place for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered on the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the past century.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of widespread reflection in cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about the previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was named El Chapo, escaped from the military road.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched for the Valdez column to get information about the kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past we would have already known what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose clay bodybuilding has served him the surname El Flaco.
"Now all the communication channels with our sources have broken down."
Valdez’s office has become a storage space for labels and adhesions protesting the murder of journalists, and the editorial staff has become something they could never expect – activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a couple and went to the local prosecutor's cabinet next morning to demonstrate for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western Michoacan state three days after the assassination of Valdez.
The dead body has been found burned and officials say it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more voiceful and criticize the phrase "SOS press" as an organized protest on the walks and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez is in Washington, trying to gather international support to put justice on the foot in the case of Valdez.
A day after Valdez's death, during his meetings with the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of striking journalists and killing them for saying the truth.
After that, he asked him to move from the reflection of government activities elsewhere, worried that anger has affected his objectivity.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are organized by crime, co-accused state officials and any society “limited”.
In his latest book "Narco Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by narcotic gangs, but they are also done by the order of politicians and security forces, who are organized by crime in the hole.
The media surveillance group Articulo 19 last year attributed more than half of the attacks by journalists to police and state officials.
“In Mexico you’re dying because you’re wanted to be silent,” Ramirez said.
The murders are obviously bloody.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state in Tamaulpas six years ago.
His dead body was found along with a letter that was supposedly signed by the Los Zetas cartel: "I'm here for my reports."
Beside his broken head, a computer keyboard and headsets stood.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, for example the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others leave the way, as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their leader in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez spoke publicly to the narcotic cartels with a guideline on the frontline "What do you want from us?".
Some journalists have fled from their homeland or even the country.
It is a nervous decision.
It’s hard to find a job in the exile and they still have to climb the streets to avoid dangers.
And sometimes they are caught behind, as it probably happened to the photographer Ruben Espinos, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one Mexican apartment three months after he escaped from Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, acknowledges that reflecting a narcotracker scares him.
“Mexico is on the way to hell and that’s why I started to be a reporter,” he said.
One late Friday midnight, when the latest number had already been shut down, Riodoce editors sat in front of the office on a walkway and cried the beer as suddenly all the phones began to vibrate.
In the coastal resort in Mazatlan, 19 people were confirmed to have been killed in exchanges between rival wealth and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by the messages left by the cartels found in the area.
From there on the road, reporters posted the news using the mobile phone to the Riodoce website.
The next day there was a need to change.
The Syrians went through a new shift in the area.
Bojorquez slept to the guard policemen to see if they are vigilant.
If they were afraid, they didn’t at least show it out.
Under the massive portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, with his middle finger seen throughout the Sinaloale, Riodoce staff delivered his traces.
“How would it be possible to think about the closure at all,” said Bojorquez, “if the same day Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send him to the streets to report?”
The dinosaur used the protective colour to avoid enemies
At first glance it looks like a shape, although quite scary.
Scientists have now revealed the first findings related to the unbelievable beings of the narcotic size discovered by the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Addition of Dinosaurs".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that the skin covered by her feathers was red-blue and her past had been somewhat “dirty.”
A report published in the journal Current Biology described the existence as "the best preserved dinosaur ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur insects in the world".
For the fossil, it is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the crisis, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation rabbed scientists who describe it as "really significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this beef-covered vegetarian is the best preserved of the type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 when he mined Suncor Millennium mining in Fort McMurray near Northern Alberta, Canada.
He hit something that didn’t remember the surrounding stone, and decided to explore further.
The found fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The following six years were worked on the excavation of the animal from the ground of 2,500 women (1100 kilos).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be presented to the public.
“When you kiss the eyes a little, you can almost believe that he’s sleeping,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the existence is exhibited.
"It goes into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the dinosaurs' Mona Lisana."
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this vegetable food, which is covered with foam and resembles a walking tank, was probably significantly threatened by meat-food dinosaurs.
This abundant dinosaur used red and white protective colours to hide himself from the thieves, and applied a conceal technique called anti-shadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
According to experts, this allowed the dinosaur to better fuse into the surroundings and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him.
This 110 million-year-old being belonging to the nodosaurus family came to news for the first time in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Researchers have now studied the existence and named it Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum’s laboratory Mark Mitchell, who was famous for the team that spent more than 7,000 hours discovering the animal.
Thanks to the surprisingly good preservation of the body, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of researchers were able to document the shape and size of the foam on the body of the animal.
They discovered resistance - a common method of protection in the animal state, which means that the top side of the existence was darker than the bottom.
Although resistance is common, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much greater than today's living resistance animals.
This indicates that dinosaurs were hunted sufficiently actively by other muscle-eating dinosaurs, that evolution preferred survival as a tactic rather than a confrontation.
However, the majority of the animals that use modern resistance - such as horse, sebra, or armadillus - are much smaller and more vulnerable to the seafood, which indicates that the nodosaurus had to really work hard to survive.
“The powerful hunting of the dinosaurs covered with huge and abundant fountains shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Crisis era could have been the robbery,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of Finnish organic compounds also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red brown.
Scientists continue to conduct research to get clues about this life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to figure out what the animal ate for his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell in a dead river, thus arriving with a stream to the sea, where he dropped his back in front of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as hot as it is now in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were probably far beyond the interior than it is now.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because it is completely covered with a preserved female skin, while it has also remained three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the crying age.
It doesn’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it – it’s just enough to kiss the eyes and it seems like he’s asleep.”
The Crisis era was the time when a huge two-foot moving muscle-eating dinosaurs, the teropods, came to the Earth.
Though the king of all of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of his terrible predecessors could hunt this confined dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, a monster of 38 feet (11,5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death into the sea and it mummified in the mud.
The existence was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined in the Millennium Mining in Fort McMurray near Northern Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved foam dinosaur in the world, including skin and foam, and it is comprehensive from the con to the foam.
These beings were an average of 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
From his shoulders came out two 20 inches long hours.
Scientists believe that this soap-covered vegetable cottage had passed through the present West Canada until the swimming river threatened the open sea.
However, the underwater funeral of the dinosaur helped preserve the fittings of the dinosaur in great detail.
The stone remains of this particular entity have been so well preserved that the magical foam plates along the dinosaur heads are still covered by skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the journal National Geographic: "Such a degree of conservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The stoneed leather remains still cover the mygaric smooth plates located on the animal's column.
The right front leg lies next to him and five fingers are stretched upward.
I’m able to count the quotes on his plate.”
How one activist found the answer to the question "Who's the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell got a full shock.
Just a day after traveling to New York, this resident of St. Louis sat on the bed in a room rented through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He came to the post of his former schoolmate.
It was written: "The police have just killed a 18-year-old boy and he is still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information on his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis district transmitted a real-time message about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
She posted a picture of Browne's unhealthy body laying on the street, staying there for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later in the evening again saw the sound that this time the gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of a police officer and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept the letter "Ferguson police killed just my unarmed son!".
He watched a real-time stream where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a hunting dog.
In the second video, another police officer, according to him, scratched and screamed, “I’m killing you all... animals.”
Ferrell remembers how he hit himself from the thought: "This is unusual."
“It’s not the type of murder we’re used to and what we could call typical.”
I felt terrible at that moment.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a return and went home the next day.
Having landed at 23 a.m., he went to his father for his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would travel to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the core theme in the new documentary "Who's streets?" (Who's streets?"), which will appear in the cinemas on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and strength from the perspective of those people who live in this community and who filled the answers demanding the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who was dressed in a flower dress and had a crown in their head, traveled to Ferguson, they talked again about a topic they had repeatedly talked about before that morning – about the experiences and conditions of life of the black people.
“Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?” he remembers himself asking.
“We are currently driving to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“I couldn’t take him with me,” said Ferrell later.
What is happening now is the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He has to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organization, while also knowing the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we need to do to get free and liberate ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise her in such a way that she doesn’t experience personally wrapped racism, she doesn’t differ from any other black girl.
I feel like I would make him a crazy way if I would protect him from this world.”
The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was on the road to South Florida, a police station over the way, which had become a kind of camp where activists were waiting for news about police officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who prepared lunch.
They put the foods together and helped to share them with the protesters.
For Ferrell, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," he said, noting that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the President of the Association of Nursing Students of the Minorities and focused on food justice and health-related inequalities in black communities.
“I didn’t have any organizing experience.
It’s all just shrinking.”
Several weeks later, during a evening demonstration, Ferrell met with one of the film’s co-author Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
In Ferrell’s head, the question arose: “Do you try to document what is happening or find a story that can be used?”
Such skepticism was caused by countless cases in which people – often white people – come to the community and try to benefit from its pain and resilience.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We’ve heard that the voice of people born and grown in Ferguson is not heard and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already hit hands with co-register Damon Davis, a region artist who was famous for activism in connection with prisoners.
His involvement made the project exciting for Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the film "Whose Streets?" team for years after Browne's shooting.
“In this documentary, no one is talking about us or us, but we are talking about ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was important to me how these people are depicted, because I’m depicted like that.”
Although the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement is not "a redemptor's leadership, but a community meeting," as Folayan said - he became the most open player in the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" surprisingly documentes personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” said Ferrell, laughing at the first time when he saw the finished line.
"But I realized that doing this work and humanizing the black people must be accompanied by some vulnerability."
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story emphasizes and reinsists the role of a black gay woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought about the #BlackLivesMatter theme after the 2012 assassination of the black teen Trayvon Martin on social media are gay.
“In the leadership role, black-and-white homosexual women have kept the movement in general,” said Ferrell, “and this is because we have to constantly fight on several sides.
The black female must bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is actually kept alive by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
At the same time, he claims that "this is not a kind of thing to create equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
“He was a man from whom he throwed the right energy,” he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that she was located directly on the chest line, because as a black gay woman, living in such nodes is a lot of weight.
His energy can be perceived through the screen.”
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long been missing, but the racist ties between the community and the police are still sharp.
The conditional punishment imposed to Ferrell for road blocking during the protests will last for another 2.5 years.
He describes the social-political atmosphere in the area, which he calls a home, simply as "not threatened."
Nevertheless, he still considers an important mantra that he has eaten in memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
7 Tips to Get Over After a Weeknd Party
Some of the hardest men find after a narrow party, though, that of what trouble, that is also help.
Or it comes from the saying, “evite the pockets, stay drunk.”
But it’s just an inevitable delay and a well-being for health.
What can you do to make you feel better in the morning after today’s and tomorrow’s Weekend Troll – or other party – and get over the pohmell as painless as possible?
Drink the water.
Alcohol down and up, after a big party in the morning ... or, if possible, even instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid by drinking alcohol, it must somehow get back.
Together with water, minerals are also removed from the body and the sestap is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after swallowing, it is good if it is bubble-free or just slightly gased.
Go to walk.
Certainly it would not cost a pohmell to go to your grandmother to break the trees - this can prove to be a fatal wrong decision.
But a light walk helps the body to remember what the feeling is to be alive.
Sitting in the hall and removing the pot is a more time-consuming way of healing.
Give your body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you’re going to go to the branch since yesterday’s overwinning, it’s definitely not worth trying to load a large fat bag.
Start, for example, with a fresh juice containing fruit sugars quietly placing your body on the market.
If the health of the south is already suffering, then you could try, for example, buljong.
A little later the back.
Avoid the coffee.
This diuretic will release your body from the last water.
Water and juice are your friends.
Do not contribute to the pain.
If you take a pain medication at night to prevent swelling, your liver will also have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will thus lose performance.
Thus you will break your liver even more and in the future the pimples will be worse.
In addition, the pain resistant does not stay in the body for a long time.
If you take a pain medication in the morning, don’t do it with a completely empty stomach – it will irritate your already irritated stomach.
Or if you don’t have a partner, you can do it well with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but walking does not get an orgasm.
However, avoid too active rhythm and rough poses - during the swallow, physical effort should be moderate.
Do a joke.
Talk foolish with your friends, make simple tightenings, and laugh kindly on yourself and on others.
The jokes and laughter may not be a puzzle, but they will be more fun to tolerate the conclusions with their help.
Once upon a time, it will go over anyway.
Northwestern professor and Oxford University staff are searched for suspects of murder
According to the police, a professor from the University of Northwestern and an employee from the University of Oxford are being sought after finding the dead body of a man with deadly puzzles in one of the Chicago luxury apartments.
According to the Cook County court documents, arrest orders were issued on Monday for arresting 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren accused of first-degree murder due to their alleged connection with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated kissing.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago police department to the community, the dead body was found on July 27.
Police received a telephone call and found a victim with several wounds on the body when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment house.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was identified dead at the scene of the incident and the investigators are treating the shooting as a murder, while the police are actively searching for two suspects.
Lathem has worked since 2007 at the University of Northwestern as a co-professor of microbiology and immunology.
University Public Relations Vice President Alan K. Cubbage said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathem is now temporarily removed from work and has been banned from entering the University of Northwestern.
“This is now a criminal case investigated by competent authorities and the University of Northwestern is working with researchers,” Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at the Department of Finance at the University of Oxford.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in a statement sent by e-mail: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to help U.S. investigative agencies in any way possible."
Moreover, it was written in the statement that Waren's colleagues are shocked and want him to give up.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of the Communications Department of the Chicago Police Department, recommends suspects to give up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are engaged more and more intensively in defining the exact location," Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, the suspects are being searched by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, who had just received a cryptic clue that something happened in the apartment number 1008.
According to the police, it was a good view.
Guglielm says it is unclear whether the incident itself took place on July 27.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren's stay in the building.
"We believe that Professor Lathamil and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi added.
The Grand Plaza leadership sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working to find out the chronology of the events and the victim's background and are investigating various motives, including the possibility that it was a family tile."
Innovation companies that will help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in her e-commerce startup, but the surveys were profitable.
The answers were often unfair, useful or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who manages the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products in San Francisco with 75 employees.
So he called for help from outside persons.
A new type of human resource startups is emerging to help companies find out what their employees feel.
Developing and licensing software with a firm aim to measure the involvement of employees, they enable companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymousness and a hot line of complaints, and in some cases allow speakers to go beyond C-level leaders and contact the board directly.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' involvement.
According to Erretti, during the three years he has used Glinti, he has received a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to sudden surveys and surveys aimed at certain teams, this company offers a heat map that gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing it to figure out the reasons.
Companies have begun to realize that they have to stay aware of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber, which has been rebelled in scandals since the former employee posted a blog post that described the disturbing environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For startups like Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global field of management, regulation and compliance may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020 according to the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a startup operating in Denver, Colorado, which helps to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, observed this year an increase in interest and activity on the background of Uber’s doubtful reputation.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Like Glintki, Convercent allows companies to send customized impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and look at heat maps from problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous message line that allows employees to report unsuitable behavior.
And if the Executive Director is concerned, the complaints go directly to the Board.
“The public opinion has been overwhelmed by the regulatory authorities,” said Convercent’s founder and executive director Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is found that a company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boicots, employees leave and trials, even if the regulatory authorities do not interfere.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 offices, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide a simple way to communicate with the headquarters of the company.
If the employee had previously wanted to report the problem, he had to find the telephone number or email address of the corporate headquarters, submit an official complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
This was often a disturbing and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday’s general adviser James Vitrano, who said there was no good way to track employees’ complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, however, it is possible to identify and deal with problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not come to managers who operated in other cities or offices in other states faster.
“I’m able to get closer to the overall 360-degree experience of employees,” said Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Group.
“And we will protect our participants from disputes with employees.”
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behavior, values, and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the audit company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media got mature", companies understood that they can't stop their black washing publicly online washing.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behavior, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking periodic remuneration from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an option with the approval of risk capital investors who have been supporting both startups.
In February, $10 million was funded by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the capital to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company’s total funding to $60 million.
Such investments will not be a surprise when taking into account the bond between companies, culture and risk capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more jobs than before.
Competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, have high wages and interesting projects are merely stakes on the table.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they spend their time on a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy in a company, feel they’re listening and that the work they do is rewarding, they’re more committed to ensuring the company’s success,” said Nina McQueen, who is the Vice President of the Department of General Benefit and Staff Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glinti.
Investors make profits when the companies belonging to their portfolio go well; the companies go well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools allow to increase employees’ commitment and involvement, then it’s no wonder that they find support.
The possession of data about the involvement of employees is important, according to work culture experts.
However, these data are useful when the company’s observers do not deal with them.
In fact, when a company asks its employees for feedback, it can generate expectations that the changes are ahead.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, it can cause disappointment and reduce employees’ involvement.
"When you ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of the consulting and business management company Kotter International, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying on too much data collection.
"Because when things don't go to the end, the employees think, 'Do you really have taken me to hear?
Do you care?
And if you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now conducting research among employees once a month, has been able to implement measures on the same day the problem has been through Glinti.
And after receiving feedback from disappointed employees in the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, is gathering new data about employees and is hoped that in the long run it will lead to a longer-term commitment of employees in the industry, which is known for its high labour flowability.
“If you’re not committed to ensuring transparency, you’re losing people,” Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose.”
Eurozone's bright star is the Baltics: income is growing rapidly
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have affected the Baltics, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the income of the wealthy countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the European Central Bank report.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, the total economic output per person in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
Success is behind low debt burden, rapidly improving institutions, and business- and free market-friendly policies.
“Baltic countries in one with Slovakia are among the few countries in the euro area where the real GDP per person of purchasing power has significantly approached the EU average,” the central bank said.
Although the aim is to make the total economic output per person equal to the wealth of Western Europe, in 2015 the total economic output per person of the Baltic economies was only 2/3 of the average of 15 countries belonging to the European Union before the 2004 expansion cycle.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local people are not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies are going very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, it thought about the economies of their countries a little less than half of the respondents.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel twice a day exercises makes the Bruins days longer
The hour is almost 23, when the trophy of UCLA footballers stops to chat with the team on the edge of the new training field located on the campus.
Some of them have scratched a shirt from the back, revealing their workout camp’s first day of the effort of sweating on the back.
For a large part of the team, these power minutes offer a break from the middle of the day.
After a three-hour training, the players will return to the co-life for final trials before returning to the Wassermani Football Center at 6:30 a.m. the next morning.
“The next three days will be a real challenge for them,” Bruns coach Jim Mora said a little before Monday was Tuesday.
The decision of the NCAA to cancel the exercises that take place twice a day to reduce the burden of players, has actually made their days longer - at least until the end of the trials to get one-half on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three trainings were scheduled to start at 19.15, to match the players' already tight schedule.
The transition from two exercises a day means more than one workout days - the start of the Bruins workout camp was raised compared to the previous season almost a week in advance and the first time during the six Westwood seasons the workout takes place during summer courses.
They are scheduled to take 18 workouts until 20 August, before the official preparation for the September Open against Texas A&M begins.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA rule change, although it adds another point of agenda to the players' narrow schedules.
"They have an enormous burden in three or four days and it's a serious challenge," Mora said.
“And they break themselves through this temptation; they try, they are good young people.
I think when Saturday comes and we have more time, it’s really nice.”
Once the camp is over, the UCLA will make the training closed, but this is not an easy task, considering a clear view of their challenges from the nearby parking area and the remote Luskin Center, a higher-class hotel that has already gotten to get in touch with the defensive network around the gateway with the escaped football.
From this weekend, the hotel’s Bruins players will be busy, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
“We are taking security measures,” Mora said.
“This is a real concern and it’s not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film the training there.
If you have a record of training, you can do a pretty good deal with it.
But we use the safety team there and on the 8th parking place.
We use the best of the existing.
I try not to worry about it.
We have a plan.”
Savisaare-Ivanova Electoral Union born to the Central Party, Kristiina Ojulandi, dismissed from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljuste, forced to leave the EKRE, created by the unification of the forces of Our Tallinn and the hopeful businessmen's Electoral Union to show the hands of the parties - it seems that the Electoral Union created on the initiative of the parties to dismiss this year will participate in local elections at least as much as the parties.
But the tiges are counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who remains with Savisaar?
When the supporting group of Edgar Savisaare has decreased, we can imagine the events held in honor of his electoral union.
One member of the National Assembly, some former and present Central Parliamentarians and many unknown faces – will this be the form of the Electoral Union?
And is the reason why some faithful supporters and friends of Savisaare keep away from the nomination in Tallinn, can be sought from the fact that the "Savisaare list" of supporters, which is headed by corrupts and suspects of corruption crimes, is becoming a reality?
The music video filmed on the roof of the municipal government for a Russian-language pop song, in which the elder of the Lasnamäe district is involved; and in every sense the original computer game, in which the main character of the Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to drive by the wheel to avoid the lombs and oraves that have fallen on the road - is this the way that the Central Party will try for the first time the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters to be allowed to join the electoral boxes?
We are waiting to see what the other parties are thinking about the youthful election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers from the beginning of August in place of entertainment, there are two options: agree that in the future only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English-speaking France24 channels will be viewed in the free stream, or transfer every month to some TV operators.
There are probably also those who are publicly pleased with the advertising-free television experience, but at the end they still - even though contradictory - pay for the television and advertising.
The sounding music, the noiseful people and the ruins left on the streets are the unpleasant side phenomena of almost every major music festival.
If you don’t want to participate in the noise, it’s worth going to discover the homeland instead of hurting the head at home – and sleeping place for a long amount to leave to the festival guests.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
The media reports cite President Donald Trump, who said a new U.S. immigration plan is on the plan, which will change the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 people per year, stricter rules on the provision of temporary employment and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The draft law will be discussed in the two houses of the Congress.
“This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars in taxpayers’ money as it changes the way the US gives green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the chain rate and will begin to replace the current program.
The new application process will benefit candidates who speak English and have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said in a statement.
Siberian seto youths move to the city, retirees return to the land.
Yevseev's Anatoli continues the tradition of the famous seto gold crawlers at the outskirts of the Earth River.
He works 140 kilometers away from his home as a driver in a golden cartel near the Mona Additional Gate of Kuvai.
It’s hard work: two months in a row without holidays, 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and back again.
During the three years of working in Artell, Anatoli has only seen the gold once.
“There is a hard order: when entering, it is thoroughly checked that the wine does not bring with it, and when out, that the gold does not bring with it,” Anatoli says.
Mare Piho talks in the village of Haida with the local seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
Siberian setodes still preserved archaeological culture will also begin to influence home-setodes, because it is just so stunning, considering the most thoroughly distant setodes studied by Piho Mare.
It is 30 years since his first research trip to Siberia this year.
He has been there for 14 years and has lived there for a year.
How many settlers were still moving out to Siberia in the late 19th century and early 20th century to get the land here?
This is an unresolved question.
I say that 8000.
I calculated it according to the stories of the Siberian Seto men who have also thought about it.
Exactly, it’s hard to say, because at that time there could be up to 30 people in one group, but the passport was given only to a man.
The pass was given only to one, but with him were children, sisters, etc. relatives.
Look how big it was here!
It was several times greater than the historic Setoma.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The seats came here as farmers, but their lives changed, because here they came into areas that were not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (winning), gold mining, industry.
For example, in New Petersburg, many sets later went to work in the hidden city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (there was built by the Soviet power of the uranium refinery plant - J.P.), when it was formed.
Did the Seths represent the majority of the population in this region at the time?
They lived compact.
In addition, there has been a long tradition of marrying each other and multiple childhood.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much the Siberian setode culture differs and differs from the native setode?
They are different, although what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of people.
They also did themselves, but they always made a difference between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change has strongly influenced the traditional clothes of the set, because it’s cold here.
Food has changed.
For example, Setomaal meat was salted, but here it was just frozen.
Where are the Siberian setodes villages and what life is living there? / graph: Alari Paluots
Communication with Motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
It seems to me that now that the Setumaa begins to give back there, it begins to influence them.
These girls who have lived here in families have heard amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who arrived in Haida at the beginning of July for the Seto Kingdom Day and lived four days in their homes - J.P.
What’s left here is amazing.
"Tapale is extremely easy to come and go, because the city has a great location: the railway point and the crossroads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera solist from Tapal.
The city has long been not just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural sites, and pizza can be found in every corner.
Tapa is the top-top city!
On the side of the White Sea, which runs through the city, there is a small island where the tapans get used to hold the jain party.
“This beautiful place doesn’t look out of the train window,” Reigo worries.
Whoever is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river, for the river is full of sources.
I’ve been swimming, I can do it.
On the river corner you can take a picnic and just make a romantic - you can look at the river flow and think about life ahead and behind.
I have also been walking with my brothers.
On the other hand, Tamm, from the opera, has gone on the river between three bridges and practiced his aaria: "For this place is on the side of the city, no one may be opposed if I break my own stories."
"A wonderful view from the town of Männikumäne opens to Tapale, but there are also health halls where you can run, ski in the winter, and now, for example, play discgolf - golf has been done, chains can be borrowed from the sport center," says Reigo.
Old professionals are going there with their discs, but I have not yet come to play there.
It is likely that the colleague Rasmus Kull Tapale should be invited to visit because he is an experienced discgolf player and has chains available.
He borrowed me.
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable times of the childhood of today's opera-isolist.
At least during skiing hours.
There is a lot of tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you can in my sport.
Not to mention broken clothes and skies.
“The whole city is now full of construction works, all of this becomes unknown,” Reigo tells us.
The Tapa old and tired wooden building, however, is a very attractive place where summer exhibitions are played.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M. director Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to make a summer theater with his theater.
Although this year’s theatrical season “Alexey Karenin” just ended, on August 11, the railway station will be “Elluvarkament”, as the old castle building moves around in the 1980s.
“From the 11th to the 13th of August, Tapa City Days will be, in the framework of which there will be open home cafés and riding cultural events, including the People’s Hall,” says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city just in these days.
In the small yellow house on the 1st of May, the museum has been in place since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibitions are great and the information is enormous," Reigo praises the place, which is full of Tapa city history, most of which focuses on railways and warfare.
Reigo tells us that when Tapal passes through all the recommended places, the stomach goes empty, but fortunately the small town is filled with cafés.
“We have so good foods and when you sit in the cafés you sometimes feel like you’re abroad,” he describes.
Educated and young soldiers who come to Tapale spend a lot of time in pubs-cafes, the sestap is a strange feeling sitting there that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but around there is such an international community together.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the hands of French or American.
Soldiers, yes, we are moving a lot!
Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The television channel bTV cited the Foreign Ministry, which that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
The police arrested on the morning of 1 August a group of people illegally settled on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on the freedom of camping and are already imposing severe penalties on anyone who is missing a vacation in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The inspections will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The dogs teach the wolves to break the sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers, after a year’s break, must again give their sheep “learning material” to the sheep – probably the sheep who taught the puppets have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight injured, Hiiu Leht writes.
The same number was only three, a year ago 124.
In synchronization with the murders, there are also data from the Environmental Agency that there was no wolf spacecraft born in the mountain of Hiiumaal and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that this year two wolf spacecraft have been fixed on the island.
On Monday night, wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna in Emmaste Valley and wounded 18 surviving sheep half.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the sheepland of Reheselja village and seriously injured the other, who had to take an emergency.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified plants must be clear
The Ministry of Agriculture has sent to the Coordination Circle a draft law on the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMOVS) and amending the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law will give up the creation of a separate data collection for both the locations of genetically modified (GM) plants and the operators, for this purpose the plant health register will be used in the future.
Furthermore, the obligation of the GM farming operator to have a preliminary agreement with the person concerned with beekeeping is amended.
Although currently there are no genetically modified crops in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it has decided to declare Estonia free of GMO," said Sigmar Suu, head of the plant health department of the Ministry of Agriculture.
“It must, however, be taken into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and the administrative burden for the private and public sector,” Suu added.
The bill revokes the provisions relating to the data collection and training of GM plants and operators in GMOVS, establishes the requirements for the handling of GM plants and the initiation of economic activities.
Specifically with regard to the beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM cultivator to inform the beekeeping of the start of the GM cultivation shall be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeping before the start of the cultivation.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All stakeholders have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and, if desired, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The planned changes will affect, in particular, persons operating in the field of vegetation, beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
In the European Union, including in Estonia, it is allowed to grow only one GM plant - corn MON 810.
So far, however, none of the Estonian farmers have been interested in cultivating GM crops.
The reason is the fact that in Estonia there is no corn injury, a European stumbling, against which the corn line MON 810 is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this corn line are grown in the southern regions and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture ordered studies to detect possible contamination with GM organisms in the seeds of the various varieties of summer beans, corn and soya that are grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples showed that the seeds did not contain a foreign gen and the study resulted in the conclusion that the seeds of raps, corn and soya varieties grown in Estonia did not contain genetically modified organisms.
It can also be concluded that in Estonia there are no consciously genetically modified crops and it has also been confirmed that there has not been any accidental pollution.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited Nemanja Matic as a "genius" after the midfield player against Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
The player purchased over from Chelsea for 40 million pounds began in the last pre-season match of the United in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup Real Madrid's 2-1 victory on Tuesday, making an impression in the defense role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the runs.
However, having stayed away from the blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was suddenly out of the match form and he held up for only 45 minutes, Mourinho says it must be fixed before the Premier League season starts.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, genius thinking - he has a football mood," Mourinho said.
“We will help him get the shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matic, the other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began to play at the Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho began quietly putting his one-eight-starting man on the start of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three more footballers, but he confirmed that the club has already done "a great job" by signing contracts with three of his four priority choices.
“I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four,” he added.
“I’m even more happy if they can do four of them, but they’ve been working hard for me.”
Another sex boy got to the foot of the GSM sender on 1 August and in turn Muhus.
According to the bird observer Mati Martinson, the first bird was equipped with a escort in the Sõrves and this bastion is already flying around, has left the bastion and joined the large nightlife collection of Mullutu-Suurlahe.
This is because there is no fruit, the Voice of the Islands writes.
On Tuesday, already relatively late for the ringing of the throats, another cowboy was sent to the messenger and it was on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, the installation of shipping is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
It was equipped with a carpenter named Mati with a GSM sender in Sõrves Turjul.
“His things are all visible on the internet: how he went to Spain in winter, returned for a while on the border with Germany and Poland and then arrived on the island,” Martinson said.
A British inventor laid a microchip into his body to get into the house and the car with a handwire.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he could simply open his front, get into the office, and even run the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam has installed a small chip between his wrist and the name ring and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hanz, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip that is installed for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also exchange the locks of houses and cars to fit them with the chip, asking 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child's father has installed the technology now both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the roll.
The White House exhibition went to pay thousands of taxpayers
According to military documents published to the newspaper TIME, the decision of the White House to fly a Navy helicopter last month went to the taxpayers in the southern coast for an event celebrating U.S. production.
Green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One during the presidential boarding, was the central drawing number of the event presenting the American construction programs held in the White House on July 17.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and High Officials of the White House updated industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a hunt from Maine, a firefighter from Wisconsin and a pipe lift made in Mississippi.
According to the documents of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), which was responsible for the operation of the helicopter, the White House military cabin demanded the helicopter’s presence with the FARGO almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern outskirts for an “unnecessary” event.
“I wanted you to be aware of this because it’s an unusual event that’s under great attention,” said the HMX-1 commander a day before the event in an email to his boss, the Navy’s chief officer’s vice officer in the field of aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter will arrive in the southern outskirts on July 17th morning at 7 p.m. at 15 p.m. and will remain there until the outskirts are cleaned between 18 and 21 p.m. on the same evening.
The fact was added that if the departure from the White House should be stopped, a second teamage is required for the departure due to working time restrictions.
The original aircraft crew was at the helicopter during the incident and the squadron security crew stayed close to the aircraft throughout the time it was on the ground.
From the documents given to TIME, it was not possible to determine whether the second team was eventually needed or not.
Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
Documents show that HMX-1 examined whether a given event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it violated Hatch's law, and we were told not to violate it," the commander wrote.
“It seems that you don’t have a choice,” the Chief Officer’s Deputy Officer said.
The White House declared the event "made in America" as an official event and Hatch's law would not cover it.
But even official events have political undertones.
The President supported the efforts of the health reform that had been discussed at the time in the Senate at the event and praised the efforts to keep the government’s regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
But the requirement to use them purely for photosensus is unusual.
In February, Trump was caught down when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, a president's plane crashed on the background, and his Twitter account was overwhelmed by messages that complain about how his predecessor used the president's plane.
“The White House is very pleased with the exhibition ‘Made in America’, which represented products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials,” said White House spokesman Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 teams often make trips around Washington and the southern outskirts to practice the displacement to the White House of the President of the United States at a centimetre density.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 hosted 58 trials in the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the event "made in America" was considered the standard of the study flights of the aircraft crew that month.
The Escadri helicopters flew on that day in addition to another 11 hours for "unrelated support missions" with the president.
According to the White House, no other exhibitor of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organizing exposure on the southern outskirts of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep presidential flights budget documents and the exact costs caused by the event are difficult to figure out.
But according to the Ministry of Defense’s 2017 financial year hour prices, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The documents of the Escadron indicated the length of the flight from the base of the Navy's Quantico airport in both directions 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much below that amount.
“The calculation of taxpayers’ costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimated remuneration rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible expenses that are taken into account for annual allocations.”
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defense’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but cover the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracts.
Former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter at the time.
“The idea is to show the things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have been hardly working on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it.”
It is unclear whether Trump was touched by a helicopter on the south side of the event or not, but he was sitting behind the fire car roll.
Within the White House, Trump addressed the representatives of Sikorsky, throwing a joke on the company's products on his personal aircraft park.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three of their products.”
Grit Shadeiko - Through tears came peace and joy
At the 2011 World Cup, Daegus hit Shadeikot in the last area, a foot cramp run 800 meters, and the stadium was taken away with a candy frame.
Soon before that, he had received zero in the university held in China.
He was injured in a low-cost injury at the 2012 Helsinki Championship, but at the London debut Olympics he won the 23rd place with 6013 points.
The misfortune continued.
At the 2013 Moscow World Cup after the opening day, the Estonian record was recorded in the Estonian distance shooting.
Two years later, he won the 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and achieved the Olympic standard, but this was even more desirable for the athlete disappointment.
The hardest cadalipe was passed by Shadeiko only when he was unable to write about the outcome of a distance shooting at the EM in Amsterdam.
I would like to set one or more matchs together.
One time,” Shadeiko spoke.
Even worse was ahead: a month later his Olympic competition in Rio was interrupted due to a road injury already at the first barrier.
The time was to go down - will we continue with the seven matches?
Is two days of effort still worth it all?
She thought a long time, but found peace.
I got my head clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I thought that the previous season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, it was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I didn't put the pill in the bag yet," Shadeiko tells about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn a clean page and move forward with a new move.
Coach Anne Mägi said it was very difficult to see the suffering of care, but she understood that, above all, the athlete needs to get clear in himself.
He was so stunned by everyone.
It was hard to tolerate.
"Grit said he didn't give up and he wants to prove himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
Now there is some kind of peace.
He does it for his own joy.
The match came back in May when Šadeiko set a new Estonian record of 6280 points at Götzise's multi-matches.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark with a mile (13.89) and ran in a record near-time barrier race.
Then the multiplayer realized that it was not a branch of capabilities, but that it was just the primary race feeling that was deleted.
He, who has been teaching him for years, says that Shadeiko is a pattern student.
He is an athlete, he is good to train.
If something is wrong or wrong, he will say it immediately.
He knows his body and confides in his sense.
We must rise from that.
I can't say exactly what to do and we're going to follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the one who makes the workout to the maximum," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right sensation, because it also guarantees a good result.
Children’s happiness makes them happy.
Good emotions have also offered the happiness of the loved ones.
Both her former coach Maris Mägi and sister Grete have recently become parents and the multiplayer has received support from new air citizens.
“It was very interesting,” said Shadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equal to the brain’s “training.”
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is so a great wine fan that he believes that wine can train the brain better than anything else in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
His words are not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the “very active” wine taste process.
By smelling a glass, turning wine in the mouth, enjoying it, and feeling the aftermath, we put our brain into work to create a wine taste.
According to Sheperd, wine molecules do not actually contain taste, but the taste arises from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
It brings a comparison of how the brain "see" the colors.
“The taste is not in wine, the taste creates the taste of wine,” Sheperd says.
The things that still affect the development of the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of sulfur that a person produces.
Sheperd of course suggests that wine is not to be filled with drinking.
“There must be more in action,” he says.
If you take a too big pot, the system is overwhelmed.
Excessive drinking wine can hurt the brain rather than benefit - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine are at risk of memory loss, loss of balance and decreased mental capacity.

"Narcose" Season 3 Advertising: Now that Pablo Escobar is gone, Cali's cartel is going to the center of Netflix hit series
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was revealed in the "Narcose" second season, Netflix series is far from the end.
The third and fourth season have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already been completed by a advertising clip that brings the series up with new bad ones.
In the third season, the DEA will turn its attention to the world’s richest drug trafficking organization – the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crossroads "as a Fortune 500 company", just with more submissions to the government and more violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the leader of relations with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is operating in New York.
In a newly released ad clip, Pedro Pascal’s return looks like Javier Penana, a character who recruits law enforcement assistance from the United States and Colombia in the war against drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcose" will open on September 1.
According to the United Nations, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday that the elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
UN Assistance Mission Chief Nicholas Haysom said that hundreds of women are candidates for local Soviet elections, three women are candidates for vice-president and more than 30 percent of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate by emphasizing the importance of women's role," she said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be trustworthy only if women are fully involved and engaged in all stages of the election process.
The local Soviet elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has threatened an election process that will coincide with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisable.
This year’s elections celebrate the first time the power is peacefully transferred from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysomi, the strong role of women will increase democracy success in Afghanistan.
According to the independent election committee of Afghanistan, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything more acute for both big and small.
Together time is always too little, but training with bands gives a good opportunity to combine meeting, game, proximity and burden.
And what a comfortable solution - no matter where you’re on a cruise in the summer, the living crafts are always with you, and with their subtle voices they remind unbearably: “We’re going to train now too!”
Start with heating - very good is a regular gold game or flagship along the coastline.
The jacket is the foundation of staying in the form of the legs and straw - then who would like to take the shape of a sand cake proud of the waves during the summer?
Imetore is to use kinds instead of kinds!
First, it’s safe and comfortable, the weight increases gradually at the same pace as the coach’s strength.
Advanced people can also make clothes with very large children.
The child trains the balance, reads the repetitions and feels the fun of the opportunity to stand up and be important.
Older children can at the same time make the clothes themselves.
The scope of movement puts place by touching the ground and stretching the hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask to keep the miniature properly.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
Plank is an overwhelming but hopelessly boring exercise for the child.
It is easy to make it fun!
Game-plank: Take a long plank column, from which the reboot will be pulled through.
In fact, it’s harder than usual, but much more fun to do when you can give a hand to a friend.
To add the burden, you can stay in a plangus, a small shore, and in this position you can also walk around.
For additional difficulty, a smaller child can be placed on the shoulder, but this exercise provides fun for all the children.
While the crabs swallow on the sand, triitseps, straw and stomach muscles get a burden like nuts.
The child falls on his legs so that his body is distributed equally in front and behind.
You can keep your hands closed for safety.
Close your legs and stretch directly up.
The foam can fly, have fun, exercise balance and be difficult.
The life of a little trainer is extremely pleasant when he gets a little mouse in every rise.
Additional burden is given by stretching the legs.
Make sure your back is in a neutral position.
In children themselves, the stomach muscles are much more fun to do with a pair and a plate.
Handwork and pulse.
Monitor the safety of the child, the knee position, and keep the back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and great fun!
At the same time, it is truly effective for the entire body training.
The sports tools were Ott (10), Säde (8), Happiness (4).
From the Philippines to the widespread world or the Bear Box Journey to the Hearts of the Moefans
It is a summer class, which has become a hit product in the past few years, which a good summer buyer has to hang on the end of his hand, and which the merchants, despite its modest origin, have been able to make a hit-like price picture.
The bag rooted from the nails is probably one of those things that have existed every time in life and whose possession has not caused special emotions.
It just exists, and if it is not, then there is nothing broken.
But now the shoulder bags are making a real victory, and fashion fans have replaced their fine design bags for summer months with simple shoulder wrapped bags.
It’s not just a beach bag, but it’s even popular today as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk to the office with it.
At this point, however, it is worth to clarify before whether such a summer look for the boss is still sitting, or it is worth a moisturizer and a laptop, however, to a little more formal sum.
But the exchange wealth has made the shoulder a real summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign moeblogs, the first thing remains to be seen is that fashion makers take the first thing to the local market on a vacation trip and buy some shoulder to which they will then be faithful all the time of their vacation and which goes along on the beach, the market and even with their friends on the city.
Some bloggers are so kind that they buy a lot of pockets from the market and sell or give them to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that the demand for pockets is so high among the readers that in the real world women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand to each other to become a happy owner of some pockets.
In some ways, such a madness is also understandable, because it is rare that the times when it is difficult to buy something that has risen into a hit status for just a few tens of euros.
Indeed, wise merchants have also discovered a simple money-service option here, and thus smaller luxury brands sell beverages for a few hours and a thousand euros.
Probably even so that wealthy customers should not feel simple, who walk around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag for more than a thousand euros.
For the interpretation of Chanel’s shoulder, however, it can go out in a row of 6,000 euros.
Unlike most fashionists, the shoulder bags do not come from some of the great fashion masks, but their story began far from far.
The shoulder bags are alleged to come from far from the Philippines, where they have been carried away.
It is an expedient and the locals often don’t see to go around.
It is alleged that the beer swallowing technique comes from the 14th century and is quite similar to the usual swallowing.
However, as the shoulder box does not need to be rooted as strong as the basket, patterns and other materials can be mixed into them, making the basket more personal and more attractive.
For example, there are trendy bags in recent times, in which colorful paels or skin cracks are inserted.
Thanksgiving letter can be sent especially to the actress Jane Birkin, whose greatest broken shoulder had never been seen before.
In fact, he adjusted his shoulder to all kinds of clothes and didn’t even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
In the popularity of pockets today, there is no smaller role, however, that the care of them is crucial, and unlike all kinds of other sumadans, they do not need to be careful with special means, but the thing is also done with water and a wet towel.
As in the case of trends, beyond the classic appearance, brands come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want, you can buy a roasted riddle from the shoulders or rather a thumbnail.
However, it is worth remembering that the classic shoulder bag will never go fashion, but the olive grill will never go fashion.
What is the classic shoulder?
For centuries it has been considered classical such a bag rooted with shoulders, which resembles a basket in its style, is open to it and has short, as well as shoulders, sandals.

GMB is worried about investment after McVitie’s Glasgow factory
The association is expecting confirmation from the McVitie’s leaders on long-term production plans at the company’s Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silent about the future of the Tollcross object investment.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products, employs more than 500 people.
The company's McVitie's owner in Pladis said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the object in the last few years.
There, more employees were hired and the chairs of the trade union were "the first to hear" when something in the factory's activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s headquarters, GMB Scotland called on McVitie’s side to “solve concerns regarding the lack of funding for the updating of production lines.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we don’t get a clarity from the head of the object about Tollcross’s business needs and the future investment plan makes our members deeply concerned.
A number of generations of families have worked here, and the workforce consists largely of the local community and the people around Glasgow, being an essential support base to ensure proper employment in a region with high unemployment and dominated by social weather disaster.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and in the context of Brexit, the growth in housing costs and the chronic decline in production, McVitie’s is urgently in need of a strongly growing productivity.”
The representative said: “Tollcross’s object manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value the active interaction with staff and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between employees and GMB representatives was held at Tollcross, where a number of issues were openly discussed.
We then discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are continuously reviewing our activities – and this applies to all of our companies and facilities – to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: “In the last years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross facility, most of it has gone to production lines and operations improvement.
We fully understand Tollcross as the heritage of the production object, and if any changes in the activity of the object should take place, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear of it.”
Was PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's approach three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up the efforts to attract Neymar to his rows by making an offer of £189 million for his purchase. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest trip?
This smooth approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of transfer, set in the past season with Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will begin to receive a salary of more than £500,000 a week from PSG after payment.
Barcelona is angry on both the approach and the breakdown of Neymar, although a source close to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care for the footballer since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the football world of such a possibility three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing an agreement with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi hardly warned all clubs who are thinking about hiring some of the best PSG players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch some of our players, we’ll stand against them and get in touch with those players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to conclude a contract with any of our players, they must face the consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this boundary as the Spanish club showed interest in the PSG player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they won’t let the Italian under any conditions leave and that Barcelona could get a reversal as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
After Brexit, Ireland wants to build a bridge, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to hit a clash between Northern Ireland and Ireland, the UK and Ireland," Varadkar warned during his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
“I can’t imagine who would benefit from it,” he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects have made possible the current free movement of people and goods, Varadkar said.
“This is our vision for the future: to build a bridge, not boundaries,” he emphasized.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer the UK to remain part of the European Union, and because it is not possible, he would remain part of the European single market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the UK’s departure smoother would be the establishment of a Customs Union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Irish Prime Minister explained.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could be like that with Britain."
The alternative to this would be the return to the customs points that would declare historical breakdown and political failure.
“Flight to trade, prosperity and peace,” the Irish Prime Minister said.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that its result could affect any aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Prime Minister of Ireland met in Belfast during a visit to the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland.
His first half-long triathlon passed by Märt Avandi: Ironman can pass by anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital Otepääl, where about 1,000 triathletes from more than thirty countries participated in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was won by Märt Avandi.
“I thought it was difficult and it was difficult at the end,” Avandi said in the end.
Despite the complexity of the truth of Avandi, triathlon is actually a profitable head for everyone.
“Not the distance kills, but the pace kills,” he said, indicating that with a profitable pace everyone will reach the finish.
Out of Ott Sepp: "Oti physics is okay, but unfortunately he doesn't know how to swim."
He has been training since February.
Initially 4-5 hours a week, but later 10 hours a week.
At 05:34:12 he reached the 270th place in the overall score.
While Avandi lost to both Raio Borgo (time 04:59:53) and Jürgen League (time 05:06:37), he won other so-called "prominent class" champions.
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a "good example person", lost to Avand in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (time 06:31:53 and 06:45:18 respectively).
Ironman's Otepää stage men's record winner was crowned by German Johannes Moldan at 3:58:27, the best of Estonians was Ivo Great at 04:14:09.
Among the women, Danish Helle Frederiksen won at 04:24:01, and Estonian Maria Jänese, who lost Frederiksen in about half an hour and got at 04:58:58.
The Avandi passed a swimming distance of 1.9 km in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He arrived at the 410th place.
