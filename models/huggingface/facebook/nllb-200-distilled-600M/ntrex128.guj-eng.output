The AM of Wales was concerned about the appearance of a mammoth.
Some AMs are concerned about the proposal to change their title to MWPS (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It arose as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
The AAMs of the entire political spectrum were concerned that it could lead to ridicule.
1 A worker M said his group was concerned about the match between TWP and PWP2.
For the reader outside of Wales: Whale TBP means fool and PWP means PU.
Pled AM said the whole group was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
Welles's conservative said his group was open-minded about the name change, but he noted that the MPWP's Muppets were literally jumping in.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English letter U.
The Assembly Commissioner who drafted the law for the name change said: The final decision on any description of what will be told to the members of the Assembly will be decided by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 authorises the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of an organised public consultation on proposals which identified widespread support for the Assembly to be known as the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission in the matter of the title of AM favored the Welsh MPs or WMPs, but the MWP option was the most supported in public consultation.
The AM seems to suggest alternative options, but getting a consensus from the authoritative official, Elaine Jones, who is expected to deposit the raw draft legislation on the changes within a week, can be a headache.
The Act on Amendments will include other amendments to the Act on Disqualification of AMs, including the design of Committee System.
When the AM discusses the law, they will have the final vote on the question of what they should be known by.
The Macedonian people will vote for a referendum to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
A famous vote was held to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has the territory known as Macedonia.
Athens had long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represented a claim to its territory and repeatedly objected to its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on changing the name, said he would not consider the referendum.
However, referendum supporters including Chief Minister Zoran Zeev argued that the name change is only the price paid to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells became silent as churches in Harlem were in trouble.
Historically, the elderly people I spoke to said that there were bars and churches in every corner, Mr Adams said.
Today, there is no Ka'i.
He said that it is understandable that the bar disappeared.
Nowadays people are socializing differently, he said.
No longer will there be a long time next to residential houses where people go regularly.
Because he was worried for the churches that the leaders would not survive as long as they wanted the money from property sales, and sooner or later they would get back to where they started.
He added that condominium apartment buildings filled with people who do not help the rest of the holy places in the neighborhood can replace churches.
"The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be poor people", he said, "and so the day is not far away when these churches will be completely closed as most people who come to these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a Black metropolis - a decade after the Metropolitan Community, St. Martin's, in 1870.
In 1930 the original white Methodist congregations were moving.
Black congregations praying nearby occupied the building.
The main street to shop in Harlem was the Reeve, who boycotted retailers on 125th Street. St. Martin was occupied by black mobs led by John Howard Johnson, who objected to keeping or encouraging black people.
A fire in 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but as Father Johnson's priests planned to rebuild the building, they began to ring bells.
Father Johnson's father, the Rev. David Johnson and the successors of St. Martin, proudly identified the bell as the bell of the poor.
The experts who rang the bell in July said something else: Cultural treasures and irreplaceable historical tools.
An expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffane N.G., noted that it was the world's first instrumental to be played by a black composer, Dionysius A. Lind, who had been visiting a large carillon in a church by the river 18 years earlier.
Mr Meriwether said that St Martin had not taken his place.
What has been happening with St. Martin for the past few months has been the story of a complex sculpture and contractors, some brought in by the raw leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Westry - The parish governing body, composed of raw leaders, wrote to the Diocese of Westry in July, expressing concern that the Diocese was not involved in keeping the sculptors and contractors sent by the Diocese of Westry, although it wanted to pass the expense.
Some priests complained about the lack of transparency from the diocese.
A 13-year-old man was injured by a shark in Lobster Dives in California.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked and injured by a shark while diving for a curve on Saturday, officials said, the first day of the curve season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Bacon's Beach in Encinatas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with his friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help and then he pedalled toward it with the group to help him pull out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought he was just a cracker, but then he realized he was screaming, I realized a little!
I've got a little bit of a sense!
Her entire jaw was uncovered, Hamel said, and she noticed when she found the boy.
And I called out to them all, and said, Come out of the water; and there is a shark in the water.
The boy was airlifted to Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on the critical condition list.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Life-saving Captain Larry Gillis told the media that a few weeks ago a shark was spotted in the area, but it was determined that it was not one of the most dangerous species of shark.
Gillis added that the victim has sustained serious injuries to the upper part of the thigh.
Investigative and security officials closed the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casabledo to Swami in Isinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area but most are not considered threatened.
Sainsbury's plans pushed the UK beauty market.
Sensbury is keeping boots, superdrugs and dabenhams in a department store with assistant staff as a stylistic beauty expert.
As a sustainable push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which has been steadily growing as sales of fashion and homeware have been falling, large beauty items will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, taken to more stores.
Investing in beauty is used as a way to use the sanctuary spaces reserved for TVs, microwaves and homewares.
Sensbury said it would double the size of the beauty materials it offers to 3,000 items, including Revlon, Essay, Twizerman and Dr. Pauvap for the first time.
L'Oreal's current range of Mabelines and Bruts Bees will also have a greater presence in branded areas, as seen in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up range to make most items strictly vegetarian-friendly - which is in increasing demand among small shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer will experiment with discounting fragrance shops at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which is in Croydon, South London, opening last week while the second is set to open in Selby Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and buying small amounts of daily food from local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to get people to visit.
Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coop said stores will be growing like a department store as supermarket chain discount providers seek to fight back to Eldy and Lidi through more services and non-food.
Sunbury has been holding Argos stores in thousands of stores since bringing in both chains two years ago and has opened a number of settlements, which are said to have supported grocery sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The previous effort of the supermarket to improve their beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
In the early 2000s Sainsbury tested a joint venture with Boots, but the alliance ended on how to split revenue from the chemist's store in their supermarkets.
New strategies have come since Sainsbury sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy chain owner Malik Sellacio for £125 million three years ago.
He said Lloyds in four stores will play a role in the planning by expanding the luxurious range of their skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director, Sainsbury, said: "We have improved the look and feel of our beauty materials to enhance the atmosphere of our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained collaborators who will be helpful in providing advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all needs and pleasant environments and convenient locations, that is, we are now a destination for beauty products that challenge the old style of shopping.
Peter Jones was knighted after Holly Willowby pulled out a £11 million deal.
When TV presenter Holly Willowboy pulled out a £11 million deal, Dragons Dan star Peter Jones became disillusioned with Mark and Spencer and doing business with ITV for his lifestyle brand.
Villaghai does not really have time for its own homeware and accessories brands.
Peers' business was merged with Gwyneth Peltroes Group brand.
This morning, the 37-year-old presenter used Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
At the last minute Holly Willowboy has troubled Peter Jones, the Dragon's Dan star, by withdrawing the business of the attractive lifestyle brand to focus on his new big deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Merlo was shocked when Jones was told by a golden girl on TV at her empire headquarters in Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that she had made a new deal worth £1.5 million - meaning she didn't really have time for her homeware and accessories brands.
The business resembled the Gwyneth Peltrou Group brand and doubled Willowhouse's estimated £11 million fortune.
Since Willowboy, 37, used Instagram to announce she was actually leaving, Jones kept moving out of Britain to go to one of her holiday homes.
Sources said: "It is indeed the highest priority of Holi so far.
It was going to be her long-term future in which she could see herself for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, how close it was to the start.
The warehouse at Merlo Headquarters was packed with ready-to-sell faces.
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most trusted stars, this morning could lead to a loss of millions to the company due to a heavy disruption in the range from cash and lightning to items such as clothing and homeware.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother and husband of three Willowbaughs, Dan Baldwin Jones, and his wife, Tara Cap were close for ten years.
Villaghai actually set up the setup in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Spending some holidays and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Beludwin TV production company.
Willowboy became a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm Celebrity.
Sources close to Jones said last night that we did not comment on his business matters.
We had a hard time talking and then we fell in love.
He joked that the news media would criticize him for commenting, some would call him unexpected, and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump waste so much?
Trump said in the voice of the news reader.
I have not done anything wrong.
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump held the inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, a major step towards North Korea becoming nuclear free.
But, nuclear-free talks collapsed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top ambassador RI Young Ho told the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not looking for any relevant response from the US to North Korea's early disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. has begun issuing approvals aimed at pressuring the start.
During his speech at the rally, Trump expressed a lot of optimism.
"We are doing very well with North Korea", he said.
We were moving towards war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now, we have this wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim have yielded good results - rocket tests stopped, the ban helped liberate those in the camp, and the rest of the US soldiers returned home.
And he defended an unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to get the presidency, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get in from this closed war zone, we have 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing thousands.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told not to need it.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was temporarily displaced, no national disasters were declared, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a bit challenging", Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is trying to get to Pilu, it is not certain whether foreign workers can work on the ground.
Shri Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency said that Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Paluu to determine whether international agencies can be exempted from contributing to relief efforts.
Regarding the way the earth of Indonesia is constantly shaking, this country is sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
This is not commonly seen on the coast when tsunami shelters are being built in Eshe.
Although the warning is in effect, there is apparently a risk of loss of life due to the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo.
At the best of times, traveling to many of Indonesia's islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make systems more complex.
A hospital ship is in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's obsolete infrastructure a major issue in his election campaign, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has left the administration of Mr. Joko concerned as he is to face re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure due to growing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority adopted more conservative forms of cults.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced from their homes as Christians and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows, arrows and other deadly weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge deep-diving match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a 30-yard pass from Xherdan Shakiri when his team was 1-0 behind Chelsea.
He grabbed the ball with his left hand before hitting a shot to the distant post.
This attempt slipped out of the box as it hit the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball jumping Kappa fell on Arizabalga and fell into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get in that position, to get to the ball and a player like Shaq always plays as much forward as possible, so, I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolIFC.COM.
I saw Kanthe coming and touching one and couldn't think about it too much and just shot it.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead of Belgian star Aiden Hazard in the half after scoring in the 25th minute.
The Blue Striker stopped spinning between the pitches and Matteo Kovickan passed that game again before running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic was passing fast in the middle of the field.
He then threw a beautiful throw ball, which pushed Hazard forward into the box.
Hazard had slipped out of the defence and ended up in a remote post net through a left foot shot and out ahead of Liverpool's Alison Baker.

The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and the resulting waves of up to 20 feet were causing many people to get stuck between the roads of buildings, the agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of over 380000 people, was filled with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after the woman died.
The murder investigation was launched after the woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old man was found with a broken leg at 7.55am on John Street in Grayson Moss, where he was arrested on suspicion of murder of a 32-year-old man.
The police urged those who saw or heard anything in the area to come forward.
Spy Inspector Brain O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages but I would urge anyone who is in the vicinity of the Jodhwan Street area in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have anything caught in the dashcam footage to contact us because they may have information that is relevant to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local from Birkenhead and was found inside the property.
After noon, friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene this morning to ask questions about where she had met her.
The investigation has begun as the police said they were in the process of informing the next victim's family.
A taxi driver from Grayson Maves was still trying to return to his flat but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he learned what had happened, he could not say anything.
Now residents have been told that they will be allowed to enter for hours.
A police officer was heard saying that the entire area is now seen as a crime scene.
A woman was seen with tears on the spot.
She kept saying that she was very hateful.
At 2 pm two police vans were inside the besieged area with one van colliding outside.
A number of officers stood within the siege to monitor the block of flats.
Any person with information was asked to inform DM@MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Stoppers by anonymously referring to log 247 of 30th September at 0800 555 111
The statue of the Cromwell Parliament has become a famous advanced monument due to its historical rewrite.
His deportation would be poetic justice for the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious works, such as the Taleban, created by his religious cult followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek's suggestion as a foolishness and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, President of the Cromwell Society, said: "It could not be avoided that the current debate on the removal of the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War did not even command or be drawn by Cromwell.
Perhaps a false cromwell would be sacrificed in the previous century for the steps of his ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hameau Thornecroft's remarkable representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century sentiment and part of a character historiography that many still consider important to celebrate.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was remembered as the guardian of Parliament against many external pressures, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, in his case certainly monarchy.
Whether or not this is an accurate representation is a subject of historical debate.
It is certain that the dispute in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a commendable figure who represented that part.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.
The murderous pig Moles Chinese farmer died
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by his surname Zhao, was found near the station on Sunday morning after a report, in a blood-covered condition with a broken artery, at the Liopanshui market in the Guizhou region of southern China.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to give vaccination injections to pigs on Hogari in the Xining of Qinghai region of China.
He reportedly came from the Unnan area with his brother on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle saw him dead, and found the door of the neighborhood pigsty open.
He said that the big pig in the stew was with his mouth blood.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
My father-in-law's legs were bloody and severed, his father-in-law, referring to him as his surname, Guyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yoon entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
And the beast that slew her was not of Jonah, nor of his father's wife.
When police gathered evidence from the scene, the market administrator told the evening news that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking.
Yoon's family and market officials were seen negotiating compensation for the death.
Despite the exceptions, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in which the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig stuffed a Welsh farmer in his tractor until his wife moved away from the scene, frightening Janvier.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that blood tastes can make them irritable.
They are just playful.
They're naysayers, very curious... they're not meant to hurt you.
You should only give them the proper respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are causing heavy rainfall extensively in the southwestern US.
As predicted, it weakens as Hurricane Rosa passes through Mexico's cold water.
However, throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S., Rosa will bring rainfall in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a range of 1 hurricane. Sunday as of Eastern Time, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
By then, a gulf in the Pacific Ocean has begun to form and move eastward along the west coast of the U.S. Rosa Baja will arrive on the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, pushing deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern U.S.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rainfall in Mexican areas.
Subsequently, tropical humidity will bring heavy rainfall in the south-west region over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding conditions, waste streams and possibly desertification.
Deep tropical moisture will cause 2 to 3 inches of rain per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest area, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the nature of the rainfall, there is a possibility of rapid flooding with catastrophic conditions.
The advice to venture into the desert under the threat of tropical rain would be considered quite bad.
Heavy rainfall can make the valleys flowing rivers and the storm will bring local stormy winds and blow dust.
The arrival of the trophy will bring heavy rainfall of some local intensity along the coast of Southern California.
There is a chance of a cool half an inch of rainfall that could cause small streams of garbage and narrow roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some of the scattered rainfall will begin arriving in Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before rainfall becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will fall on Tuesday in four corners and will remain till Wednesday.
Throughout the U.S. there may be some sharp temperature increases in October as the North Pole gets colder, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes it causes dramatic changes in temperature in a short time.
Sunday is a prime example of a dramatic change in temperature in the central U.S.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the late summer heat will try to rise and spread again.
Much of the central and western U.S. will see warming begin in October that will reach 80 degrees wide in parts of the northeast from the southern plains.
New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the eastern U.S. is very likely to have above average temperatures by the first quarter of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's hearing was watched by over 20 million people.
Thursday's testimony on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and accused of sexually assaulting her in 1980, Christine Blasse, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
By the time the broadcasters interrupted the regular program for Friday's last-minute turn, a political stand-off had begun: a contract drawn up by Arizona's SanI. Jack Flake will conduct a week-long investigation into charges for the FBI.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh caught her drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a hasty testimony, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is estimated that over 20.4 million people saw it aired recorded by Nielsen.
The company had an average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The statistics were not immediately available for other networks including PBS, C-SPAN and FOX Business Network which showed it.
And Nielsen usually had some trouble-measuring people who looked in the offices.
To put it in perspective, the size of these spectators was the same as the playoff football game or the Academy Award.
The Fox News channel whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, surpassed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Friday's drama featured a man in the flea center.
After the Central Republican Office issued a statement saying he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught barbering on opponents by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he was going to the elevator for a justice committee hearing.
He stood up for a few minutes with his eyes closed as it was produced, broadcast live on CNN.
"I am standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She was told, "You have power, while many women are powerless".
Flack said his office issued a statement and before the lift was closed said he had a lot to tell the hearing committee.
While the entire Senate was to vote for the Justice Committee to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination, all cable and broadcast networks were covering live broadcast hours.
But Flack said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week that the minority Democrats were requesting.
Flack was somewhat persuaded by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
After a conversation with Coons and some of his later senators, Flake made the decision.
Flack's choice of authority was because, it seemed, the Republic could not allow Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British PM could accuse critics of playing politics on the Brexit issue.
Prime Minister Theresa May may be accused of playing politics with Britain's future and disregarding national interests in exchange for her accusation of leaving the European Union due to the coronavirus.
Prime Minister Theresa Birmingham, UK may attend a Conservative Party conference in the UK on September 29, 2018.
In her interview after her interview on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said she had attacked her by telling her checkered plan for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU's proposal to collect each other's tariffs was completely unreasonable.
Ved Sims shooting: Police arrested suspected of killing Dayton Simpson's LSU player
Police arrested 20-year-old basketball player, Ved Sims, on death row at LSU for allegedly shooting him to death.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the fight between the Sims and the Simpsons, and police said Sims' glasses were lost during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Sivasan, the police said that he admitted that the man had fatally shot Vijay.
His bond was settled at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The parish coroner's office on the East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report on Friday stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head in the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and citizens who helped with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alava thanked the area law enforcement for their continued commitment and justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
Botton grew up in Rose, a 6-foot-6 forward where his father, Wylie, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team had disbanded due to Wade's death and was in a coma.
"You are always worried about this", said the Vedas.
A volcano blows ash over Mexico City
Ashes from the Popocatepetti volcano reached the southern neighborhood of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned residents of Mexico to stay away from the volcano for 24 hours after 183 gases and ash started to leak out.
The Centre was monitoring multiple voices and vibrations.
Photos on social media showed thin ashtrays frozen on car airtightness in the vicinity of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geologists noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protests against the riots of pro-independence protesters clashed with police and joined thousands of protesters on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization on the partition.
A group of facial-covering separatist supporters who were pushed back by riot police threw eggs and paint powder, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets usually crowded with tourists.
The crowd also left later in the day after the police used their claws to stop the clash.
For hours, anti-independence groups chanted "No apology, no apology" which the united opposition faced with such a boom, "Spanish immortality".
Fourteen people were treated for common injuries sustained during the protests, local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence sector even a year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist cantons.
Voters chose to be independent by a large majority, however, as the opponents of the split largely declined to vote, fewer people voted.
According to the authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured after police tried to stop voters from voting at polling stations in all areas where violent clashes took place last year.
Anti-independence groups pitched tents outside overnight on Friday to stop protests in favour of the National Police.
Protests took place but they had to take a different path.
Narcisse Termes, 68, who joined his wife in protesting separatists, said the electrician had no further hope of Catalonia gaining independence.
Last year we lived our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote but now we are stuck, he said.
Despite the special arrangements for regional elections last December, the pro-independence parties of Ketan had difficulties maintaining that insanity this year as many of their prominent leaders have either been personally deported or are imprisoned over their role in gathering a referendum and then declaring independence and awaiting trial.
John Puge, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in favor of the police on his phone, said the riots were provoked by politicians from both parties.
It was becoming more and more stressful, he said.
O'Reill Junqueras, who has been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
Standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to restore democratic values and condemn the repression we have faced from the Spanish Government.
London: A man was arrested after a car broke into a house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after repeatedly breaking into a house in London.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Belyanagrad Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemming, who is investigating, said the doors and building were also damaged.
At some point, a fire may also occur in a car with a crossbow.
The manga strike gave Livingstone a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Mangan assured a first-round win for Livingstone
The excitement left Livingston surprised the Rangers as this was only the second defeat of Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibroks club.
Dolly Mangan's strike proved to be the difference between the two as Gray Holt's team moved one level ahead of Habernia in seconds.
Gerrards' team was far from winning this season of the premiership and will face the leaders who are eight points behind them next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
By the time Livingstone will have started their unbeaten lead in the six-game division, Holt has yet to taste a defeat after taking over as head coach Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone will lose opportunities against visitors without edges.
Holt's team should have been far ahead of them before they scored, causing problems to their directness rangers in all ways.
Scott Robinson was completely broken but continued his efforts against the goal, after which only Allen Lithgow managed to pull Craig Holcott's head after sliding to meet the goal around.
The hosts had the material to let the Rangers play against them, they knew they could get visitors in trouble piece by piece.
And so the important goal came.
Rangers accepted a free-kick and worked on Livingstone's opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson coming together to arrange Meghan who touched and scored from the middle of the box.
Up to that point, the Rangers had held onto the position but home defence was unsuccessful and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had largely nothing to do.
Although this method continued in the second half, Alfredo Morelos was forced to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was disqualified by the foot of ranger goalkeeper Allan McGregor and a Livingstone player, Lithgow, who was scheduled for the game, struck Wade.
Livingstone's box continued to cross and he continued to exit with two penalties to push away a handball after challenging supporter Glenn Middleton by the helmet.
The unusual - analysis from Livingstone
Alsdair Lemont of BBC Scotland on the playing field of Tony MacArthur
An extraordinary look and result by Livingstone.
For one man, he was amazing, expectations from him were starting to rise.
His style of play and players have rarely changed since he was given the best game, but he is widely credited for the way he has managed the team after the arrival of Holt.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halcott handled the beautifully arranged protection very well while the manga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell constantly dominant.
However, the Rangers were less motivated.
They were good as long as they were under the Gerrard, they were below his standards.
His final ball was missing - only once they opened the home team - and it was time for the Rangers to wake up to see themselves in the middle of the table.
In Kollagne, a mixed reception was given to Erdogane
On Saturday (September 29) there was a smiling and brown sky on the faces as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany was the last day - which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They highlighted issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then proceeded to Kologne for the inauguration of the new massive mosque.
It is the most populous city outside Turkey.
Police gave security reasons for stopping a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their leader.
Thousands of opponents opposed to Erdogan - many of them Kurds - but their voices were heard both by Erdogan's police and the decision of the German government to incorporate him into the country.
The belligerent opposition portrayed the visitor as a hero by some German Turks as divisive and vilified him as an autonomous by others.
Departford road crash: A cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred at around 10:15 BST near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the southeast area of the city.
The driver of the car was standing and paramedics examined him, but his man died on the spot.
The collision came about a month after a second cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Children's Street about a mile from Saturday's collision.
Metropolitan police said the authorities were working to identify the man and inform his next family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been diverted and motorists were advised to avoid this route.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the disorder
Six prison officials were injured after a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison office said.2
The order was broken on Sunday at around 09:30 BST at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and is still underway.
Expert Tornado officials have been brought in to address the unrest, including eight cohabitants and one wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: Special trained prison staff have been appointed to deal with the problem of MMP Long Lartin.
Six members of the staff have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could be sent to jail for long periods.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most notorious criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor was treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And riot control officers were jailed in October to address the serious unrest in which the pool ball was used to attack employees.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, fear of flooding from Hurricane Rosa over Salt Lake City (drought-affected areas may benefit)
Tropical pressure rarely meets Arizona, but something similar is going to happen early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa has traveled across the southwestern desert, causing a risk of an uncontrollable flood.
The National Weather Service has already set a watch for the flooding for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and western Arizona in Utah, for Monday and Tuesday.
Rosa is expected to catch a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix has tweeted that only 10 tropical storms have been classified as storms or stresses in the 200-mile area of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that struck a 40-mile area of the AZ border.
Advanced National Hurricane Center models have predicted rainfall of up to 6 inches, with 2 to 4 inches scattered across the Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other desert areas of the southwest including Central Rocks and Great Basin have expressed the possibility of rainfall of up to 4 inches with 1 to 2 inches scattered.
Of those at risk of flooding, the rain of rosas can be a blessing as the area is drought-prone.
While flooding is a matter of great concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the South-West is currently facing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second largest series, reported by weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa lands all over the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
With maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, the hurricane is still 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico on Sunday morning and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming into contact with cold water in the Pacific and therefore its intensity is decreasing.
As such, it is expected to hit land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening at the pace of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall across Mexico could create a very high risk of flooding.
From Baja California to northwestern Sonora, 3 to 6 inches of cool rain is expected to rise to 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then make its way northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical pressure, which will then make its way southward through Arizona to Utah by Tuesday night.
Major damage from heavy rainfall from the roosa or its remnants is expected in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to cause life-threatening flooding as well as landslides in desert swamps and hilly areas.
Midomore Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
A 16-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man after he was found with a gunshot wound in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Redstone area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials have urged everyone to come forward who has a mobile phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh endured, that is, the anger of the Democratic Party
Voting for Judge Kavanaugh means rejecting the Democratic Party's toughness and offensive tactics, Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the demise, anger of the Democratic Party throughout the entire process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh was tried before Congress on the first Thursday, with Christine Blaise forcefully and emotionally denying the charge by Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when he was a teenager.
Ford was also examined during the hearing on the charges.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people showed brilliance and quality and courage to speak.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation is a vote for the most complete legal mind of our time, a jurist with a proven record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President specifically referred to Kavanaugh's nomination for the importance of turning Republicans into interim elections.
Five weeks away from the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really running, he said.
That is why I am fighting for the best candidates everywhere.
Trump argued that the Democrats are on a mission to resist and block.
The first key procedural vote in the House on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to be held no later than Friday, senior GOP leader Aide told CNN.
Thousands have died in the Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the numbers are still rising
At least 384 people have died when the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was struck by an earthquake and tsunami, with large waves hitting the coastline, officials said on Saturday.
When a six-meter (18 ft) high wave came ashore on the beach of the city of Paul on Friday evening, thousands gathered around the river to celebrate the feast, which squeezed many to their deaths and destroyed everything that had happened in its path.
The 7.5 earthquake in Tbilisi was followed by a tsunami.
"When the threat of tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still doing its activities on the outskirts and did not immediately flee and became victims", said a spokesman for Indonesia's Disaster Prevention Agency, BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come on its own, it forced anyone to hit cars, logs, houses, land, said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami travelled at 800 kph (497 mph) across the open sea.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial photos released by the Disaster Agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, pools collapsed and collapsed and water around the mosque.
On Saturday, a coastal city began to shake after an earthquake.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in its statement that the energy emitted by the devastating earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which ends on the shores of a long narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nagroho described the damage as extensive and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some of the victims were trapped under the collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the area known as Donggala, 300 km (190 mi) off the northern coast of Palua, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake, could have suffered more damage to lives and property.
Communication system in Donggala is completely disrupted, no information is available, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are moving towards the affected areas.
"This is an accident in itself, but it can get worse", he said.
The agency was heavily criticised on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami in Palou, although officials said the waves had reached by the time the warning was issued.
Footage posted on social media can be heard from the top floor of the building, where a man is giving a terrible warning to those down the street that a tsunami is coming.
Within minutes, the water-like walls collide with the shore and carry buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the immediate footage.
The earthquake and tsunami unleashed widespread power that disrupted communication around Pallu making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military from Jakarta and other cities began sending cargo planes with relief supplies, officials said, but the displaced people still desperately need food and basic necessities.
The airport in the city is open for relief activities only and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo arranged a visit to the relief centers.
Indonesia tsunami death toll has reached 800.
It is very bad.
While World Vision personnel safely reached the city of Palu from Donggala where staff were sheltered in Tadaptri shelters in their office yard, they saw scenes of destruction on the way, said Shri Dosemba.
And they told me how many houses they saw destroyed. And he said,
It is very bad.
Even when relief groups started disaster relief operations, many complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers were also prevented from entering the palau.
According to Indonesian laws, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only come from abroad if the affected area is declared a National Disaster Area.
This has not happened before.
It is still a regional disaster, said Auliya Arriaani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government says, "Well, this is a national disaster, we can open up international aid but it is not yet the case".
On Friday night, the earthquake and tsunami struck Paul, and his friends and relatives who were still missing were sitting in the hope that miracles would occur or natural disasters would occur.
On Saturday, the little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been crushed under the body of her mother who had been next to her for two days.
Jendon Subandon, coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games that were recalled from Indonesia earlier this month.
Among the others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, the ones Mr. Mandagi included were his students.
As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how the news was spread to the paragliding community hours after the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, who had graciously sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu Harifo who were attending the Beach Festival.
However, his message only saw one grey check instead of two brown checks.
"I think that meant the message didn't get through", he said.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling up an ATM at Newport in Levi
The robbers stole $26,750 while Brink's workers were filling ATMs at Newport in Levi on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car in the entertainment complex was clearing the ATM and preparing to pay more money, Danish McCarthy wrote in a news release.
While he was busy, another man ran after the brink's employee and stole the bag for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information relating to their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to - Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: Formally known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed Yes for a while and used the moniker for his eighth album released in June.
This change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday night's live show where she is set to launch her new album Yendi.
He took part in the show of singer Ariyan Grande who had cancelled it for emotional reasons, the show's creators said.
As well as a piece of his current business, West had previously said that the term had religious significance to him.
I think that ye is a word that is used frequently in the Bible and in the Bible it means you like the West radio host Big Boy Say said earlier this year when discussing his album
So, I am you, I am we, it is we.
He removed the cannibalism that had only one meaning, that is, that only our good, our bad, our minds were shown to everyone.
This album sheds more light on what we are.
He is one of a number of rappers who have changed their name.
Sin Combs was known differently as Puff Daddy, P Diddie or Diddie, but released his preferred name this year as Love and Brother Love.
The previous West collaborator, Jay-Z, also did the Hyphon with or without capital.
The AMLO of Mexico has pledged not to use military force against any civilian.
President of Mexico - Elected Andrés Manuel López Obrador vowed never to use military pressure against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the bloody vengeance against students.
Lopez Obrador will never use the military to suppress Mexicans at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday.
As the leftist student movement was spreading its roots throughout Latin America, soldiers fired on protesters on a quiet demonstration on the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing about 300 people at the time.
Lopez Orbador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly subsidies to students and opening more public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving youth into criminal gangs.
The US needs to double AI funding.
With China's increasing prevalence in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount of research being done in that field, says researcher and AI practitioner Kai-fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after AI was announced by various parts of the US government, as well as the lack of formal AI strategy in the US.
By then, China had presented its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research given that all other countries are far behind the US, and we look forward to further success in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding will double the chances of a major breakthrough in AI in the U.S. next year, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Shinovision Venture CEO, Hoagton Mifflin Harcourt, has joined China's most important AI company, Face++.
In 1980, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that could defeat America's top-ranked Othello player, and was then an executive at Microsoft Research and head of Google's China branch.
Lee welcomed the technology competition of the previous U.S. government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotic challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the future vision.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work very hard to get government grants, Lee said.
It's not China that's taking academic leaders; it's corporations, Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited brilliant people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Changes to immigration policy could also help the US increase its AI efforts, Lee said,
I think that those who have done PhDs in AI should be given a green card automatically.
The State Council of China issued its plan to prepare next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The way the National Science Foundation of China funds U.S. researchers is financed by the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, the National Science Foundation of China is funding people from educational institutions, but the quality of educational work in China is poor, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense had created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
For NFS, it currently invests over $100 million annually in AI research.
As of now, no action has been seen in U.S. law for months to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians voted for a referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to rename their country the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece that ended their bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province known as Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor. The name reflects its claim to its territory and its veto of entry into NATO and the EU.
In June the two governments agreed on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the name change would reduce the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Selvic majority population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote for the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum would come out to vote.
Question on the reading of the ballot for the referendum: Did you accept the agreement with Greece and become a member of NATO and EU?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zev, argued that it was justified to pay the price for one of the countries formed from the collapse of Yugoslavia and for example in institutions like NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Oliveira Georgiveska, 79 at the SCOPJ.
While not legally binding, enough people in Parliament said they would stick to the result of the vote to reach a decision.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required to change the name.
The State Election Commission had said that there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 pm.
However, in the last parliamentary election of 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their ballots in the ballot box, only 16 per cent came to vote, compared to 34 per cent.
"I came out to vote because my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old voter Gjos Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
In Strumca, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Duscho cast their vote in a referendum to rename the Macedonian territory, paving the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Karvadarkov was setting up a small stage in front of Parliament and setting up chairs in front of tents set up by people who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through service", said Kvadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we are well-off.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can become like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia coordination.
Prime Minister Zev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 per cent.
"I think a large majority will be in favour of it because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zove said after casting his vote in the ballot box.
He said that the results will ensure our future.
Polls released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than necessary.
Another poll by Macedonia's Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents were considering voting on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
It takes 50 percent plus one vote to be successful.
Failure to vote in the referendum will blow up the pro-Western government's policy for the first time since it took over the government on May 2 last year.
See: Sergei of Manchester City navigates the defence of the whole of Brighton for the Aguero goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling distinguished themselves in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England, defending Brighton.
Aguero showed how comically easy it was in his 65th minute score.
Early in the sequence, the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between three of Brighton's defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He was wrapped around a defender before being outrun more times in the corner of the Brighton box.
After that, he passed on his left side, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero who used his right boot with a shot on the right side of the right net to defeat Brighton's keeper Matthew Ryan.
Aguero was experiencing some problems with his legs, city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
55, 60 minutes we talked about their game.
It has happened.
We were lucky to score a goal for him at that time".
But it was Sterlin who benefited the Sky Blues in the early days of the Premier League schism.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In that game Aguero scored the ball in Brighton Deep.
He sent the ball through the throws to Leroy Sine with a left flank.
Seay made a few touches before leading Surling to the far post.
Sky Blues sent the ball into the net before it was taken further out of bounds.

Schuyler wants to play against Spoiler. Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off dispute, there was no good reason to force another start.
But always a competitive chaseer hopes for a round against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there is a play-off effect for the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have confirmed a wild-card spot with at least a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to lock-up their first-class title.
Even if we're not playing to get anything, at least we can rub rub rubber-took, knowing that here in Denver the atmosphere will play to the highest level of the crowd and other forces that might be faced this year.
Why don't I want to compete in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but it is reportedly busy letting Shazer pitch in such a situation.
Shzer, who will make his 34th start, will give a bullpen session on Tuesday and pitch on his remaining regular Sundays.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President, speaking in the midterm elections about the importance of Republican turnover, gave him a nod to the choice of Brett Kavanagh, the highest court of his country, for the surrounding situation.
Everything we did in November has been felt on the line.
The most important prediction of our lifetime is five weeks away.
This is one of the big ones, big -- I'm driving but I'm really driving, so I'm fighting for the best trainer everywhere.
Trump said, "You see a terrible, desperate group of Democrats, it's happening right now.
And they are committed to taking back power using tools in any way, you see the scarcity and filth.
They don't know who they're actually harming, and they're crushing who to get power and control, so they want power and control, we don't give them that".
Democrats are on a minnesse to "opposition and create obstacles", he said.
And you see, over the last four days, Democrats have called it "Angry and ugly and evil and lying".
She was given the rank of Democratic Senator by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Diane addressed Feinstein, who received a strong audience applause.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Yeah, yeah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting - that was really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a comprehensive church.
It is hard for those who speak of their own minds to bear.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was hardly surprising.
Anantho Gatha, I am the latest Labour MP to say you are not welcome - everyone is saying for our own sake.
My parliamentary colleague John Ryan was treated as well as she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the sensor proxy criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, on the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders over due to the widening.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
Like most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings were the same.
It is sad that these are not the tone of many meetings and the mystery of compassionate, humble politics has long been forgotten, although it has actually begun.
It has become apparent that there are no different views in the Labour Party and that each consultation is assessed on the basis of whether the leadership of the party is acceptable.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as a colleague with whom I had previously shared a similar political view, they expect me to take a U-turn and take positions for which I would never agree, whether it be on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I give a speech in Sarvgenic - and it doesn't really make any difference what I say - a sharp comment on social media then comes to call for my not being chosen, rejecting the politics of the Centre, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And my experience is not the same.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are political.
I am dedicated to the professionalism and determination of those professionals who face gender and racial ideology every day but never get embarrassed.
The most frustrating part of this era of politics is how the level of oppression has been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad church and the party is becoming more and more tightly bound with every change in the rules of the motion of no confidence or election.
I have been advised many times in the last two years that I should stress on keeping my head down, not being so rude and then I will be fine.
But that's not what I came to do in politics.
As a school student 32 years ago since I joined the Labour Party, angered by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left my broad schooling behind, I demanded support for the best public services for those who most needed them - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
In the last election, I have never hidden my politics.
In the Nottingham East, there was no way I could be misled in the area of disagreement with my policy views and current leadership.
I will say to those who have announced the proposal on Friday that as the country moves towards Brexit, this will harm homes, businesses and our public services.
But I have not a conditional noting moment, this is for my constituents, who are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that the threat of no choice or political gains will not interfere with my actions, which I want to do and which is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayer 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Ayer goes to the top
Two delayed attempts may have greatly diminished the final result, but even Nirshana deserved an unprecedented victory in this amazing tantrumship match of the day.
Now it is at the top of the list, the only undefeated party in the decade.
It was his excellent defense, as well as his better opportunity, which he had every right to push the home team forward and please coach Peter Murchy.
And he said to them, We have tried this in our games, and we have failed; and I am glad.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Iron, they took their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, altered by Frazier's climax, put the air on the front, but a yellow card for the Cape Rory Hughes of Scotland published for the game by the Warriors allowed Merlows to show the number and Jason Negot Bagot captured the unchanging attempt.
Klimo increased the Ayr by a penalty, he scored just right before half-time and converted the Ayr to a single attempt at 17-5 at break time.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second attempt and Patrick Adderson's attempt was converted by Bagot to reduce the infertility by five points.
The Ruridey note suffered a serious injury, which stretched it and then reinstated, with a modified effort by Climo pushing Stafford McDowell further forward.
Ayr's acting captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow-card when Melrose paid an extra person at the end of a severe pressure with the efforts of an uninvolved Bruce Cloyne.
Although the home-side came back and when Straw Hutchinson was given a yellow card from the penalty line-out to reach Klimon without the ball, McPherson touched the back of the Adir Moul.
The climate changed, the carrier resumed it with a big dance, Kelly Rowe sent out Flanker Gregor Henry for Homer's fifth attempt after collecting David Armstrong.
Even now, the game's tarlo is set for a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still the game's tarlo Ford Keeran is ready to move into the hospitality industry, after being announced as the director of a licensed restaurant.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis stars in the popular BBC show, which he is writing and collaborating with longtime fellow comedian Greg Bumpfill.
Both have announced that the show will conclude with the next Naomi series and it seems that Keeran Craigling is planning for an afterlife.
He is a director of Adriftmorne Limited, as per the official records list.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish Sun source has indicated that Kiran wants to join the Glasgow-based restaurant business.
Oceans are ours: Landlocked Bolivia hopes the Pacific will reopen its way for them
The sailor patrols a large number of naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sky colored flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval sites are marked with the motto: "The sea is officially ours.
It is a duty to recover it".
The memory of a coastal land lost to Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century is still burning - as it seeks to rediscover the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their highest level for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Cailajilla said that Bolivia has a sense of unity and peace, and is firmly hoping for a positive outcome.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICG's decision on a large screen across the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will see in favour of Bolivia's claim that - after decades of unstable debate - Chile is bound to negotiate a sovereign exit for Bolivia in the Chilean Sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's miraculously indigenous president - who faces a contentious battle for reelection next year - has several rides in Monday's administration.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean, we took the oath at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that a court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia - and if so, that would be a small change.
The Netherlands-based UN has no power to surrender Chile's territory, and it is determined that this will not determine the outcome of the possible negotiations.
Paz Zeret, a Chilean expert in international law, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after hearing the final argument, indicating that the issue was not complicated.
Removing because of Bolivia might have set this back the last four years.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zort said.
He advised that Moralos' aggressive statements had stripped Chile of any indecent good faith.
Bolivia and Chile will not be able to talk about a topic, but it will be difficult to discuss afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former Bolivian representative in The Hague, President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, rejected the idea that the decision-making process by the court was unusually quick.
Monday will bring a unique opportunity for Bolivia to unveil a new era of relations with Chile and bring an end to 139 years of mutual disagreement by mutual consent for Chile, he said.
Calzadia also denied that Morales - still the most popular among Latin American presidents - used the maritime issue as a political base.
Bolivia has never renounced the right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The ruling party tries to show that they need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says nuclear desertification will not happen until it trusts the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that if he does not trust Washington, his country will not take the initiative to destroy nuclear weapons.
Ray was addressing the Joint Assembly on Saturday.
He called on them to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival leaders.
The comments come from the US, which feels Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is re-establishing a more than three-month-long, volatile nuclear diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un after Singapore.
Re says this is a pipe dream that will keep sanctions and American opposition unabated and will bring the North to its knees at any time to complete the Korean War.
Washington is wary of agreeing to a declaration without implementing the first significant disarmament move by Pyongyang.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country sees as the only option for its guaranteed security.
Pompeo is planning to travel to Pyongyang next month, in preparation for the second summit of Kim-Trump.
The Parish fashion show highlights the latest style of headgear on a large scale so the High Street is right next to you.
If you want to increase the collection of your hats or to completely block the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Brown unveiled a series of unique giant headgear for their SS19 collection on the road, which glittered the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats this summer have made Instagram agile and these designs below the catwalk have attracted attention in front of their eyes.
The Stand Out Piece by Valentino was an over-the-top badge hat, decorated with a long brim like a fan, which decorated the heads of the models.
Other overloaded materials including a toadboat ornament, a wonderful hat and pineapple - but they weren't designed to keep your head cool.
Thomas Brown also revealed the odd facial selection - and only for Halloween time.
Many colored faces had their mouths sewn and the hoote looked more like a Henible Lecter than a cowherd.
One construction was accompanied by a scuba diving gear with snowballs and black glasses, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And you publish a huge fashion statement - you are lucky.
Those who observe the style speculate that giant bonnets can make their way on the highways.
The outer hat looks attractive on the high-heeled shoes of the Jala Bomba, a two-foot-long brick-topped Puaal hat, which has appeared on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
The most widespread impractical hat on social media was a cult label behind it, sending a large design underneath the catwalk - a pool beach bag as big as a swimsuit-sized model.
A burnt orange rafia bag, cut with rafia fringing and cut with a white leather handle on top, was a stand-out piece in the Jamesus La Rivera SS19 collection at Parish Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitej told FEMAIL: I hope that big hats and beach bags will hit the high street next summer - because the designer has made such a big impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Essential language skills for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence and have been unbroken with a set of excellent exam results in 2018, which are only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the school, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), is providing the highest level of service to its students and aspirants.
The aim of autonomous schools is to prepare their students for further and higher education, to prepare them for their chosen career and to maintain their status as global citizens.
As an education sector, which establishes and implements a school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages are uninterrupted as a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you talk to a person in a language he understands, he understands.
If you speak in a language that touches their heart, you will be able to understand them".
When we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, this is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English.
Recent results of this year show that languages are at the top of the league rankings with the highest percentage of students graduating from independent schools.
68% of students studying foreign languages have obtained a higher grade A.
Statistics collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 per cent of students have obtained the grade in Medellin, while 72 per cent are German learners, 69 per cent are French learners and 63 per cent are Spanish learners.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill that children and young people will need in the future.
In the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere, languages are being taken as subject selection as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 per cent of respondents were held liable for language skills deficiencies for reasons given by employers to struggle to fill vacancies.
Language skills are becoming essential for the majority of young people to prepare for their future careers.
This skill is essential in a global world with more likely employment opportunities for languages.
Choose any career, but if they have learned another language, they will get the real benefit of acquiring this kind of life skills.
Being able to communicate directly abroad will put a multilingual person in front of the competition himself.
A survey of over 4,000 British adults in 2013 found that 75 per cent were unable to communicate sufficiently in a foreign language and French is the only language with a two-digit percentage, the only language spoken by 15 per cent.
This is why it is important for children today to integrate language learning.
Multiple languages will provide adequate opportunities for children, especially those with developing economies, to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the school languages that are taught will be different.
Many schools will focus on more traditional modern languages, while others will teach languages that will be considered the most important for the UK as of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in the independent schools, which are specialized in the field.
Scottish independent schools are renowned for providing learning opportunities that will prepare and equip children with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
In today's time of global business, it is not denied that it is very important for the future of the country, which is why it is reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to provide opportunities for Scottish youth to be interested, diverse and excellent.
This must happen.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron in St. Diego to launch the Lakers on Sunday.
The wait for fans to see LeBron James is almost over, with the Los Angeles Lakers Matt Te's making his debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But it remains to be decided how many minutes he will play.
That would be more than one and less than 48, Walton said on the official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudeau tweeted that James will likely play for a limited time.
James was asked about his plans for the Lakers after studying earlier this week, a six-game presidency schedule.
I do not need Princess Games to prepare myself at this stage of my career, he said.
Trump's time at the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign rallies in Wyoming, West Virginia, starting tonight.
Last week was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies, which include a suspension in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
As well as voting in favor of the decision to fill the Supreme Court vacancies, Trump is aiming to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as there is a risk of losing control through the Republican Congress when the vote is held in November.
What is the time for Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia train down through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kannanuagh, who has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct by the Senate Confirmation Vote on Hold for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main objective behind these excitements of the rally is to help the Republicans face the challenges of November.
So, President Trump's campaign that this week's five rallies are aimed at activating volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and expand the presidencies in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Congress control is so important to his agenda that the President will visit as many states as possible as we are in a busy campaign.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the Wheeling has plans for a Wesbank Arena, with tonight's rally bringing supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receiving coverage from the Pittsburgh media.
This will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia on Saturday, the state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump tries to help out West Virginia Republican Senate Rep. Patrick Morris, who is behind in the nomination.
According to Reuters, Simon Haider, a political scientist at West Virginia University, said, "This is not a good sign for Morris that he has to try to get ahead in the presidential election".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show a desire to stay alive in the lonely Sunday
After three one-way sessions, Saturday afternoon happened to only four sets, which was probably the requirement of this Ryder Cup.
The pendulum that moves is a perfectly innovative game concept, but a player who actually believes and then never happens in competitions like this.
So he'll say where is the speed now?
Because it's been going around all day, Jordan Speeth said, "They had a six-digit promotion and now it's four, so we're giving it a little bit of speed".
Europe has definitely gained four points with twelve more points in the game.
As Spith says, Americans feel that the air is a little more favorable to them and they have a lot of incentives, not as Spith and Justin Thomas, who play together for a full day and each score three out of four.
Speith has been shaped from T- to Green and is leading by example.
The festive shout began to catch on as the round went on, while A and Thomas were on the to-down to-after, a crucial put-sink occurred to take the four-square match into the match.
The pitcher who won the 15th game was met with similar screams, which shows you that the American team is not out of it.
'You really just dug deep and worried about your match,' said Spith.
Each of those players has now left it.
18 holes to mark.
The only players with more points over the past two days by Spith and Thomas are Fonseco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The most unusual of Europe is that the couple is four to four and can't make a mistake.
The only couple who didn't bounce on a Saturday afternoon was the Moliwoods, but they did bounce on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, after 9pm.
The run and the way their energy flows on both sides of the crowds, it seems, they are the losers on Sunday, and no more popular player for a potential European win, so sunset towards Fleetwood or Molinaire than Lee Golf National.
Specifically, the two are together in separate holes.
However, European pride is ahead of its time.
When he was joined by Alex Noren, Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson played Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning show Fourball.
Slide the Spaniard and Swede into a hole, in which he will never get close to climbing.
However, there is no one to help you get out of the hall on Sunday.
It is very attractive to take a closer look at Forball and Forums, because the conversation between couples does not take advice they give and thus the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has performed better as a team, so far and on the final day, it has gained a significant promotion, but the forum session reveals that the team is willing to fight USA, which was condemning some special statistics.
Europe has been promoted from 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
After Saturday's exit from the Forbowl and a 10-6 lead over the United States, Europe will take a fair advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup in four matches.
The lovely couple Yomi Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have led the Tigers to two wins over Tiger Woods, who are currently struggling to take four points in the A Le Tiger National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side wants to save the trophy they lost a year ago in Hazeltha and take the series 3-1 to dominate the American team in the morning in football.
The United States resisted further in the Forums, winning two matches but could not work it out.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 single matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to have four points live together, while he and Molinari dubbed 'Mollywood' after a great weekend, making this only the second pair to have four points live in their inaugural match in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forward Bowl, he performed well, beating Woods and American player Bryson Deshaumbo by a further strong 5&4.
Woods, who had seen himself in two matches on Saturday, showed an impressive explosion of intelligence, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in foreballs and foros.
Justin Rose rested for the Forboles in the morning. Dustin Johnson and Brooks returned to fellow Henry Stenson in a 2&1 loss to Copacabana - first and third in the world.
All this was not on its own in Europe during a pleasant, rainy day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time Presidents Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won the Forballs by 2&1 over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter and then beat Pauls and Rory McElroy 4&3, losing two holes early in the Forballs by hitting them in the back.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only two teams have made a single loss after a four-point loss, but Fury's side needs only to pull in to keep the trophy as holders.
After two days in second place, but striking the reins on Sunday makes it seem that this is beyond the reach.
North Korea will disarm unilaterally without trust, there is no way.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions on the United States had deepened their distrust, and there was no way the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Export Council's annual general meeting that North Korea made important good faith commitments last year, such as halting nuclear and missile testing, destroying nuclear testing sites and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in America, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such a situation there is no way that we disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
While Re reiterated Washington's response to North Korean complaints about a routine approach to nuclear disarmament, his statement was fitting that as North Korea will gradually make the right decisions - and be rewarded - this does not directly deny one-sided disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
While Kim was determined to work towards "decentralizing the Korean Peninsula", Ri released a joint speech for the first time between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, promising North Korea security.
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States emphasized "disarmament first" and increased the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective through a deterrent method, even denouncing the declaration of an end to the war.
The idea that restrictions can bring us to our knees is just a dream of people, which is a disregard for us.
But the reality is that constant restrictions deepen our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in five months: "The party to the issue of nuclear liberation is South Korea or the US, the Korean Peninsula would not have been at such a momentum.
The tone of Lee's speech was dramatically different from the one he had given the previous year, even when he told the UN. The General Assembly, which had placed the U.S. mainland on target with North Korean rockets, was essential after "Mr. Evil President" Trump referred to Kim as a "Rocket Man" who was on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with total destruction, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament this year at the United Nations, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear free.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit, "If it takes two years, three years, or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Committee should reward Pyongyang for taking action.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions must continue rigorously and without failure until we have complete, final, verifiable certainty that nuclear weapons have been destroyed".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to bid to raise funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Reine on the sideline of the UN General Assembly and then said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that only North Korea had progressed in hours by condemning him for such crimes.
This month, North Korea pledged to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate action at a meeting with Moon".
He said the measures he wanted to take were moves to move forward with security and improving relations with Washington, as Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students strive to get some rest
This year's Harvard University new course has graduated more than enough to counter the growing Macho culture being studied by the Kafein-Fulled All-Nighters.
When it comes to how to take care of themselves, the world's top university students saw an educator without a match.
Charles Kaizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Bretham & Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start this course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of it, a girl came to me and said, 'Now, in my senior year, why am I being told this alone?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, she told the Telegraph.
The first-ever implementation of the course this year explains how good sleep habits help students in their academic and athletic performance as well as enhance their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to start the course after students were sleep deprived during the week.
The hour-long course involves a series of interactive tasks.
One section features a picture of a room in the student residence, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors, and books telling about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, and the importance of sleep time.
In the second section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Map the complex with an interactive icon, then encourage participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke for smoking, added Professor Kaziesler.
He said that the culture of pride by pulling all-nights still exists, he said that the increasing pressure on modern technologies and students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring you have enough quality sleep should be a secret weapon for students to deal with stress, fatigue and anxiety - even for weight loss, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode that makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, took one of his classes during his first year at Harvard and helped Professor Kaizler design the course.
He said that this course opened his eyes and inspired him for a campus-wide course.
The next step, they expect, is that all these postgraduate students will be asked to complete the same curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kaizler recommended that students should be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting systems, which can lead to sleep problems by disturbing your circadian rhythm from the kilter.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The manga goal outsells Gerald's men
The Doll Manganie strike, a 1-0 loss to Steven Gerrard at Livingston, forced the Rangers to face a second bout of the distant blues as an unsatisfied side.
Ibrox wanted to enter his first win on the road since a 4-1 win at St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team abandoned Gerard's second defeat as manager of 18 games in his favor.
The manga hit seven minutes before halftime and was not even motivated to balance the rangers.
When Rangers finished sixth, Livingston moved up to third and just behind the hybermian at goal difference.
A throwing of an object from a clear distance can cause further difficulty for rangers in the store after the linesman strawberries are moved under treatment for a head injury.
Gerard made eight changes to the side, which earned him a place in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup last year.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Levi 11, who took a point from Hurtz last week and is pleased with the way his well-drilled outfit breathed his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated but Livingston did a lot with the ball he had.
He only needed two minutes to make it when the manga's first-ever late-off sent Scott Pittman through the goal but the midfielder seized his big opportunity.
A deep-seated cage was found by Captain Craig Hulk after Jacob's free-kick but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only extend into the rear post.
The Rangers gained control but the final third looked more hopeful than belief about his game.
Alfredo Moreloson certainly felt he should have been fined fifteen minutes because he and Steven Lawrence had collided but referee Steven Thomason rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers used only the first two half shots on target, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely bothered by Lasana Coulibaly's header and weakened Oue Azaria strike.
While Livini's 34th-minute opener may be against the game's run, no one can deny that he alone deserved his well-being.
Again, the Rangers failed to work with the deep Jacobs set-piece.
Scott Airfield did not react as Deacon Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his peace to pick the manga for a smooth finish.
Gerard worked on the break as he swapped the Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the winger's slot at the switch Morelos provided an almost immediate effect but the impressive Kelly was blocked from his line.
But Livingstone continued to play in a way that would make them enjoy holding visitors by hitting a long ball high with a sledgehammer and helmet.
Holt's side managed to increase their lead in the final stages of the Hot but before Leithgo came from the corner, McGregor stood up well to block Jacob.
The Rangers were fined in place of Glen Middleton for confusing him with Jacobs but again seeing Thomas from afar.
Punchang: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our Sunday Morning Panchang: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and COUNTING... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then the mainstream of science, Geiger has become a mainstay of counterpop culture as well as the apparently unlikely Gypock scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the 1950 film Bells of Cornedon.
Man: What is in this world?
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear earphones, you can actually hear the effects of mineral radioactivity.
Evans: Say, he sure pops up!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the quest for his name is alive.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'look' at bad cells
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to 'look' at bad cells and kill them
As part of treatment, vaccines teach the immune system to recognize disease cells.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, converting them into a lab.
Then they can see the common protein for many cancers and then they're injected again.
A test vaccine showed promising results in many cancer patients.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize disease cells found that her uterine cancer had died within 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, turning them into a laboratory so they can see a common protein in many cancers known as HER2, then re-inserting the cells.
"Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine", said J. Berzowski, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "promotes the development of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer", explained Prof. Bernzoski.
Their approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked in a form of leukemia treatment.
New West hit the Pro-Trump dietrip after wearing a mega hat after his NHL appearance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West's hero was called to the studio after a thrilling performance praising his U.S. during Saturday Night Live. President Donald Trump said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Mac America Great Hat, he continued to fight the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
I often talk to an American guy and he says, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
SNL debuted the show with a sketch by Matt Damon in which Hollywood star Christine Blasey Ford mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's rent was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock was trying to make fun of the West with the posting.
Also, West complained to the audience that he had an unpleasant time to wear his headgear.
They threatened me behind the stage.
They said, 'Don't go out wearing a hat.'
They bothered me!
According to the Washington examiner, he said, and then they said I was in a sunken position".
West left: "Do you want to see the place where the water sank?" He'll wear my Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
"You must love your neighbor".
She received at least two rave reviews from the audience and the members of SLN were disappointed, Verity reported, a person told the release there: "There were intense sounds throughout the studio".
Weston was brought in to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Loved It, dressed as a peripheral bottle.
West was endorsed by Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA group who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing out in the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply "who he is and he is quite amazing".
But I have not chosen to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing ideology and speaking something that is harmful to my community.
It is free.
So we are", she added.
Prior to the show, saying he was now known as Kenney West, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddie, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P. Diddie.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and was definitely changed by the Prince of Music legend to a symbol and then to an artist already known as Prince.
attempted murder by shooting at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with murder after killing a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Blihmakmur.
The Magistrates are expected to appear before the Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington is shot at by a toxic mortar.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has struck a chord with the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that playing such roles on screen means that young people feel they must be stronger to gain respect.
Compared to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit states that he believes 'something went wrong' and raised questions about how to overcome the toxic toxicity problem in the #MeToo era.
Who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, co-artist of her Game of Thrones, admitted that she feels too strongly about addressing the issue.
I personally feel very strongly at the moment - what have we done wrong with masculinity?
What are we teaching men about the problem we want them to have as they grow up?
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its male characters.
He continued: 'What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys think that this should be a certain part of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time - how can we change that?
Because something is clearly wrong with the young men.'
He is tired of battlefields and horses, saying in an interview that he will not be doing any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when he arrives late next summer.
Sam Shepard will star as the lead actor in the November Kit's comeback True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he plans to meet his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
He said, 'I met my wife on this show, so she gave me my future family and my life here.'
Rose played Yegret in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series about the love of Kit's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the location of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, incorporating changes from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through much of China as a result of infectious blood transmission.
At a conference in Yunnan Province, Chinese health officials said that the number of people infected with HIV has almost gone to zero.
Year-on-year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discouraged in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be severe.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases spread due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the safe use of HIV medicines as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denied the employee had leaked GOP Senator data, explosions, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. McKison Waters denied Saturday allegations that a member of his staff posted personal information of three Republican American senators on members' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insists that the claims were handled by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Lies, lies, and more hateful lies, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information transmitted included a home address and phone number for the U.S. Census. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both Utah.
The information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill on Thursday appeared online during the Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh.
Kawanuddh was leaked after being questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pandit and Redstat report that IP addresses identifying the source of the post were linked to the voters' office and published information about a member of the water staff, Hill said.
These unsubstantiated accusations are utterly false and a complete lie, Waters continued.
A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - is not in any way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and a complete lie.
Voters' statement immediately drew online criticism, including former White House press secretary Erie Fleischer.
"This rejection is in the rage", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she is unlikely to become a member of Congress.
They do not get angry when someone is accused of something they did not do.
They should not be defamatory.
They should not question the motives of the accused.
They must be calm and innocent".
Flischer was comparing voters' reaction to criticism of Democrats for Jhooter Kavanaugh, who was accused of being angry by critics during a hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navaro also expressed his thoughts on Twitter to unite voters in the midterm elections.
If the truth is true, he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office "has warned the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent claims".
We will ensure that the perpetrators are disclosed, and "they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to me and any members of any staff".
John's English Strikes Again review showed the Rowan Atkinson spy spoof to be inferior.
It is now traditional to see the importance of Brexit in any new film with a British slant and it applies to the revival of John's English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and changed life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Are we going to be self-deprecating about how we are the new opportunities of the country?
At a rate on someone, the front-facing, rubber-like face of John English has a license to remake anything a second time - though his signature name is more than anything that it's a comprehensive comedy-drama designed for a non-English - cinematic field.
He is a definitely skilled secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretenses, has given Mr Bean's armor and a doll of that boy a little clout in the fire-themed tunes of Rio at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
It is originally based on the international man of travel and mystery Atkinson who once played a barclaycard TV commercial following his disarray.
This latest JE outing has a nice moment or two.
I liked Johnny English as he approached the helicopter, while he was wearing a medieval suit of armor and a rotor blade wrapped for a while in front of his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but humor feels very little and oddly unpretentious, especially with serious film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offering comedy as their confident component.
It seems that this joke is made for young children rather than adults, and for me, Johnnie English's vain adventures are not as exploratory and focused as Atkinson's silent movie gags in Bean's personality.
The best local base now is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, exposing the identities of agents across Britain in the area, for the agent's fall on duty - a deplorable role for Kevin Alden.
This is the final straw for a prime minister who is a brilliant and embraced person who is already grappling with political unpopularity: Emma Thompson works very well with this quicy-Theresa-May character but there is nothing special about the script to work with her.
Her secret advisers informed her that as each active spy settled she would have to bring someone out of retirement.
This means that John's English fighting with himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a posh reputation, but how he's proving off-the-records to be an undercover operative: Here are some good gags, as the English spy rock type Academy presents.
The Englishman is sent back to the Whitefall for an immediate briefing and reunited with his long-suffering former buff, played again by Ben Miller.
Buff is a married man, commanded by a submarine commander, in the role of a Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which Vicky Pepadine is a bit useless.
So Batman and Robin have returned to the action of finding the most flawed things on Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which Olga Kurilenko's beautiful celebrity Fatelia Bulletova fights.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling into the hands of a tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the wicked Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bogg begin their own percycle high-junks odyssey, disguising themselves as servants, they set fire to a flash game restaurant; they smuggle aboard a luxury boat from Volta; and English triggers pure chaos as he attempts to introduce himself to the interior of Volta's house with a virtual reality headset.
All the obstacles to that final order have been removed, but as it is enough and fun, there is very little children's TV about the whole thing.
Beautiful medium material.
And I can't help but think of what else John would do with English films: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the role that really justifies his talent?
The worker refuses, he prepares a plan for Britain to work four days a week but pays for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is on the cusp of a revolutionary plan in which Britons will work four days a week - but get paid for five days.
The party allegedly wants the company bosses to make sure that employees go through the savings made by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to give them more time.
He will see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but still carrying as much pay home.
The sources said that this idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers.
The Trades Union Congress has endorsed a four-day week to benefit workers from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: The policy review is expected to be released before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day working week is an ambition that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party will not be the first party to support the idea of a four-day working week during the Green Party 2017 general election campaign.
However, this wish has not been supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day working week is not the party's policy and is not being taken into account by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John Macdonald used the Labour Council last week to dismiss his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to get power back from 'faceless directors' and 'profiteurs' in utility companies.
Shareholders in water companies will not be able to get their full shares back as the Labour government may 'cut' based on alleged misstatements.
He also supported plans to create inclusive ownership funds to put employees on company boards and hold employees to 10 per cent of private sector companies' equity, which stands to pay off the accounts with annual dividends of up to £500.
Lynden Graham, John Kennedy, 60 minutes to talk about whether an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on the nomination in the Supreme Court by at least a week and the bureau's findings raise the question of whether they could force any Republican senator to support.
In an interview with Sunday's interview, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelle asked Republican Sen. John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham, can the FBI find anything that would inspire him to change his mind?
Kennedy appeared more free than his counterpart from South Carolina.
"My point is, of course", Kennedy said.
I said, I went to the hearing and said, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this, and he said, Thou hast done this?
He was determined, determined and unparalleled.
Graham's vote, however, appears to be in stone.
My brain is about Brett Kwang and he will charge Dynamite, he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, Graham added, referring to Christine Blaisey Ford.
And none of the men whom she called could find out her name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any new transformation.
What is the Global Citizens Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival, with a very impressive line-up of callers and an equally impressive goal; an end to world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizens Festival will draw thousands to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the works of Mazon Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the celebration's goal of ending alcohol poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was called in 2012, is an area of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that actively seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are fighting against it.
To receive free tickets to the ceremony (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), musicians had to complete a series of tasks, or tasks, such as emailing a world leader, calling him or other meaningful means to help raise awareness about his goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal over 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free music program a real way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called clicktivism - people believe they are making the right difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, highlighting various goals.
He says these actions have inspired world leaders to announce promises and policies of over $37 billion to impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group reported 390 commitments and declarations derived from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has been distributed or funded.
The group estimates that safe funds have directly affected approximately 649 million people worldwide so far.
Among some key commitments to end malnutrition in the country, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and practitioners, pledges $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With your support, as well as from the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, we can make a footnote in history to malnutrition's social injustice", said Tracey Ulman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 steps were taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for a project The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million malnourished women and children.
In response to an FAQ on his website, "What do you think we can do to end alcohol poverty?"
The global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racist movement that is against us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Jenley Mona New York are some of the acts involved in this year's event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hughes Jackman.
Russian Navy could use the U.S. Navy to blockade energy supply - Interior Secretary
Washington could take the help of its navy if needed to prevent clashes in Russian energy markets, including the Middle East.
Zink accused Russia's involvement in Syria - significantly, where it is being conducted at the invitation of the Vedya government - of being a pretext to explore new energy markets.
I think that's why they are in the Middle East, because they want the power of brokers like they do in Eastern Europe, in the south of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and remedies to solve it.
"The United States has the capacity of our Navy, and the maritime route is open to blockade if necessary, to ensure that its energy does not go to market", he said.
Zink was addressing a gathering of attendees at a ceremony organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization and who have made a name for themselves as the "voice of energy consumers" in the U.S.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran and noted that they were almost identical.
He described Russia as a "one-stop shop" economy based on crude oil, saying that "the economic option over Iran and Russia is to take advantage of the lowest possible price and fuel option".
The Trump administration has been working to increase its exports of cheap liquefied natural gas (LPG) to European consumers instead of Russia.
To fulfill that goal, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, tried to pull Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Russia has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is ready to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a complete economic project.
Russia argues that the USA's strong opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we vote that energy cannot be a tool for using pressure and that consumers are authorized to choose suppliers".
Germany has not succumbed to the US stance and has reiterated its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to withdraw from the European Energy Policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said that I am very concerned about the interference of a third country in our energy supply.
Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren will take a "hard stance" in the 2020 run for president
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warne said Saturday that she would take a "tough stance" in running for president after the midterm elections.
War confirmed at the Town Hall in Holycock, Massachusetts that the Run for President would be hosted.
According to The Hill newspaper, it is time for women to invade Washington and fix our broken government, and women are at the top.
After November 6, I will take a tough stance in running for President.
President Donald Trump was showered with anger during the Warsaw Town Hall, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am ashamed of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy.
Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh have been clearly critical of the war.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We had to check with the FBI before the vote".
However, a survey released on Thursday did not suggest that most Warren candidates should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said a senator should not take this step.
Thirty-two per cent supported the move.
The poll was supported by 38 per cent in collaboration with former Governor Daval Patrick, who was more supportive of the run, and 48 per cent in opposition.
Other high-profile Democratic names in the discussion regarding a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
As reported by the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes Trac Palin's PTSD at a rally by Donald Trump
Track Pauline, 26, spent a year in the Army in Iraq in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in a domestic violence case.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Sarah told the audience about Donald, "What my son is going through, what he is going through after returning, I understand the pain of the families of soldiers who suffered the consequences of PTSD and returned with some injuries".
Describing his arrest as "the elephant in the room", Pauline said of his son and the veterans who returned from another war, "they have changed, they come back hard, they are amazed at what their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military is giving the country in return for what they have given the country".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested on Monday from Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence and interference in a domestic violence case and possession of a weapon in a drunken manner.
18 States DCs support the challenge faced by the new Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia endorse the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy, which denies asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a Friend-of-Court in Washington on Friday to support shelter eagles challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff is Grace V. The Sessions Suit filed against the Federal Policy by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been disclosed.
She was persecuted by her partner and her violent gang member sons, but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers from states supporting Grace had written to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which has led to a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum as the country faces widespread problems of gang and domestic violence.
The new U.S. Asylum Police Board reversed the Board's 2014 decision to allow undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Raisin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of old state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be decided in accordance with certain facts and circumstances and that such laws violate that principle, the Fund-of-Court told the Tunk.
The attorneys further argued that the policy of denying immigrants entry shocked the U.S. economy, which was working to become their entrepreneurs and provide "essential labor supply".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Sessions announced the policy on June 11 saying that asylum is available for those who leave their homeland due to fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
Asylum was not meant to address all the problems, all the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescue efforts to locate survivors have been intensified as the death toll in Paluu has doubled.
The situation was more terrible for the survivors.
Reza Kusuma, 35, comforting her paralyzed child at the evacuation centre in the city of Palo, said, "There is a lot of tension.
Every minute an ambulance brings a dead body.
There is a lack of clean water".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up lost luggage and trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of injured and an earthquake of 7.5 magnitude in the area were reported, hospitals were bursting with kidney failure.
Two of the wounded broke their backs and shoulders and were resting outside the Paluni Army Hospital, as patients were being treated there due to frequent strong aftershocks.
He was tearful in his eyes as he remembered those moments in the fifth floor of a hotel room that was shaken by a massive earthquake with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
Harris, who arrived in town for the family wedding, told the Associated Press that he felt like he was crushed under the rubble of the hotel.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was no voice.
I don't know what happened to my wife and my baby.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'threatening' with 'propaganda AIDS'
A four-page ad in a government Chinese newspaper in the U.S. cited the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, a week after the announcement, the U.S. ambassador accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a supplement to the advertisement for China Daily's Des Moines Register, the state's best-selling newspaper, - accusing the U.S. Congress of interfering in the November 6 election, which China overturned.
Trump has accused China of trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters, beginning a new phase of heightening pressure on China to shed light on the U.S. campaign.
It is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, but China and the US have now had to escalate the trade war, and both have imposed new tariffs on each other's imports.
China's reactionary tariffs were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa at the start of the trade war and Iowa supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, who is the longtime governor of Iowa, China's top exporter of agricultural products, said China has caused losses to American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China is now threatening us twice by running propaganda ads in our own free press", Branstead wrote in the opinion paper Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government has taken advantage of America's glorious tradition of free speech and freedom of expression by printing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branssted wrote.
"In contrast, in the Chinese newspaper world you will hear limited anti-corruption rhetoric and you will not see the true reflection of the dissent of the Chinese people on China's concerned economic flows, because the media is in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added, "One of China's leading newspapers turned down an offer to publish his article.
Analysts warn that Republican is upsetting women voters before midterm elections by defending Kavanagh
While standing with and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh in a multiple sexual assault allegations case, the analyst warned that the party will face outrage from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the issue have been overwhelming, and most Republicans are already saying they want to move forward with the referendum.
Grant Riehr, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill that there is no turning back on those issues.
I do not believe that the last minute pressure of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation will attract angry voters", Rahr said.
"What happened yesterday should not be forgotten by women - they will not forget tomorrow and will not forget November", said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the Progressive Group Movement, to the Washington, DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, when the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, protested in the Senate lobby, saying they had overtaken Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters said "November is coming!"
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats has risen", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to the news site.
People say that enthusiasm is already there; and it is true.
But it can be more swinging, especially among women voters in small cities and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often when they don't like the president".
Before Ford's public testimony detailed allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a reaction might come if Republicans moved forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, "This has become a complicated puzzle for GOP", said former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele.
It's not just about the committee's vote or final vote on whether to bench Kavanaugh, but the way Republicans have handled the whole issue and how they have dealt with the prosecutor, said Guy Sale, director of the Democratic Primaries USA Group for Electing Democrats, to the News Channel.
However, moving further toward that may lead to some degree of division among Americans following the Ford and Kavanaugh Accords.
The new poll from the NPA found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony to be true or false, while 35 percent said they were true to Kavanagh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanagh may or may not have lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said so about Ford.
The Guardian reports that the FBI is currently investigating charges made by Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following pressure from Flake.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanagh had assaulted him in a drunken manner at the age of 17.
Ramirez has alleged that a Supreme Court nominee exposed her guilt to her at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventors of the World Wide Web for Google and Facebook are planning to launch a new Internet
The team of inventors of the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee, is launching a startup to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt is a company that is building Berners-Lee's open source platform into a solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what information to allow access to.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind the intercept was "world domination".
We have to do it now, he said about the start-up.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include a contact list, to-do list, calendar, music library and other personal and business tools.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, SLACK, and Spotify and is available everywhere on the same browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that it is entirely for the user to access what kind of information to whom he gives access.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inputt is to provide the company with the resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company has contracted several staff developers and volunteer coders from the security platform Bruce, purchased by IBM by Burns-Lee, to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Invert website.
Berners-Lee said she and her team "are talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make complete changes to where all their business models stand up overnight".
We do not need their permission for that.
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inputt's "goal is to provide professional energy and ecosystems to help safeguard the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, when the World Wide Web Consortium was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Burns-Lee revolutionized the Internet.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after launching Inert, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of this web, Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: A celebration of the WW1 Victoria Cross clergy
The only church of England clergy that won the Victoria Cross in World War I and has celebrated its 100th anniversary in the city.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Van won the award on 29 September 1918 in the raids on Balenglaise and Lehcourt.
However, four days later he was killed by a sniper and nobody knew he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said he was a "brilliant symbol", declaring his grandfather's award-winning feat a monument nearly 100 years in the making.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Wayne led his battalion towards the Canal de Saint-Quentin amid "extreme fog and heavy fire from field and machine guns".
He later reached the firing line and ran solo with a field-gun with "heavy bravery" and left in three squads.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's work was "something I know I could never do but it makes me somewhat humble".
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid flowers after the parade, the parade was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "feels very honoured to be part of the parade" and added that "the support given by many is showing the bravery of a real hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Ballerot 206, instead of getting a Peppa Pig.
Imagine, you'd stay up all night watching Pack Ballet 206 to refuse to watch the main event.
San Jose's bill includes 13 fights, including six on the main card and is being shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, Gagard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other and the audience in the UK were shocked when coverage changed to Peppa Pig instead.
Some woke up early in the morning for a special fight until they didn't know it was going to happen.
A fan on Twitter called the children's cartoon "a sick joke".
Asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications, said "The government rule is that the 6pm content was not appropriate so they had to go to children's programming.
"Pappa the Pig", said the man.
Scott Cocker, Chairman of Ballet Company, said he would work on his schedule to engage UK viewers in the future.
I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably do it, Cocker said.
But it was six o'clock on Sunday morning and on Sunday our time and their time on Monday we couldn't do this.
But we are working on it.
I believe that when there is a switchover there are many texts going back and forth and it didn't all seem smooth.
We tried to fix it and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I promise you that this will not happen again.
We'll keep five fights instead of six as usual and we tried to deliver more to the fans and we went above and beyond.
It's called a bad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly feels 'named' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he seemed soft to everyone because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said that he did not realize that "not everyone is like me" until he was in high school.
Speaking on First Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about "bringing hope" to people about gay rights.
He also said that being a parent gives less attention to winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, has been ill for several months.
Appearing as a cast member on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "more lacking in them than anything else" because "it's socially unacceptable for boys and girls to choose".
He said: "To date, those who have felt less than others and felt different from others have actually given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", so he didn't let anyone down when he found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and has appealed to abolish homosexuality in more countries using her appearance at the Commonwealth Games this year in Australia.
He said he spoke because he considered himself lucky to have found a life without solutions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said he fell in love with U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, with whom he "suddenly caught up to me" in a 2013 interview.
Daly married an Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
When you go through so many good-natured occasions at such a young age - he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later. He said it's hard to find someone who has had similar good-natured experiences.
The couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said it changed "the whole perspective" of their lives.
If you had asked me last year, 'I want to win a gold medal' it was all that.
You know what is bigger than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Her son's name is the same as his father Robert, who died at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011.
Daly said that her father had not accepted to die and finally said that if he still had tickets to London 2012 - he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him that you couldn't sit in a dressed line, Dad, he said.
His breath stopped, and he really stopped breathing, and I sat down to hold his hand until he died, and I finally accepted that he was not defeated".
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
I realized that this is my life's dream - there is no special feeling in diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games.
She also deliberately chose the Proud song of Heather Small, her first song, which was used to tie the knot at the Olympics and still thrilles her.
The Desert Island Disc is broadcast on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Out of Form for Michaelson sat on the bench of the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil McCalson will set a record by playing the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid becoming an unhappy milestone.
Michaelson Rekami is playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, he was benched by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's Forboles and Foros.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, he is often done for the United States, rather than being in the middle of the main action five times as he has repeatedly done for the United States, this five-time superstar has divided his day between being among them as a cheerleader and focusing on his game and working towards what he can improve in his game.
The 48-year-old is not ideally suited for the tight Le Golf National Course when he doesn't have quite straight drivers even at the peak of his career, where long rough courts regularly punish wrong shots.
And if the course itself isn't as tough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michaelson will face British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who has paired up with Toky Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans fall four points in 12 singles matches, the match of Michaelson could prove quite decisive because the match ended just before the start of the competition.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, and he had nothing else to say.
"He understood his role well today", said Fury, "he patted my back, wrapped his hands around my shoulder and said he was ready for the future.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and in the past and this week he has poured a lot of life into this team.
I probably never imagined that he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but we thought we should move forward as much as we could.
He wants to live there like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record with Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It can make a Ryder Cup career ending memorable that never matches the height of his personal record.
Although there are 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves at Michaelsson, Furyk said his presence had given the team some unmistakable power.
He is funny, he is slanderous, he is funny, he likes to make fun of people and he is a noble person to be in the team room, he explained.
I think the youngest players can have fun with him, it was fun to watch this week.
He has a lot more than just playing".
Europe's captain Thomas Bejorn knows that a big lead will be missing anytime.
European captain Thomas Bejorn knows from experience that a massive lead up to the last day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an upset.
Dan began his career in 1997 with a match at Valladerama, in which side captain Savage won a five-point advantage over the Americans by the Bellesteros, but reached the finish line by saving a narrow gap of 141⁄2- 131⁄2 to save the nose.
You remind yourself that we had a big lead in Valladerama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won in Valladerama, just as we did, Bjorn said, after seeing the class of 2018, both on Friday 5-3 and yesterday at Le Golf National, 10-6.
So history will show me and all of our team that time has not passed.
You will be quite bored tomorrow.
Go there and do all the right things.
It is not completed until the points are found on the board.
Our goal and the goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus is.
I have told everyone that I am focused on the 12 players on our side, but on the other hand we also know that there are great players in the world".
Bejorne adds: "I never put myself ahead of the game.
Tomorrow is a different animal.
Tomorrow, a personal exhibition will come to work and it is a different thing to do.
When everything is going well, you excel with your partner, but when you have to show performance in person, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
The only message you need to get to the players is that tomorrow you have to do your best.
Now, you have to leave your partner behind and give him his best".
Unlike Björn, rival Jim Furyk would expect better performance than his partner, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four points, from the rest of the players except for the other two.
Furyk himself has tasted both defeat and victory, Europe picked up "Miracle at Medina" and was part of Brooklyn's winning team before coming out as a loser in it.
In 1999, when asked how Captain Ben Cranshwe had taken his players forward on the last day, he said, "I remember every word of it".
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we have a quick start to make as you saw in Medina, as you saw in Brooklyn.
When the momentum moves in one direction, there is a lot of pressure in the matches between.
Let us set up our line-up accordingly and put the players in a design that we think we can show some magic tomorrow".
Thompson is tasked with leading the game and facing Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter facing other Europeans in the top half order.
The second member of the singles selection said, "I went to this group in this order because I think it covers everything".
The new German warship was again suspended.
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to replace the Cold War-era battleships Kalin in 2014, but due to faulty systems and high cost, Kamsekam could not be delivered until next year, local media said.
According to the Die Zeit newspaper, a military spokesman said that the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates of the Rhineland-Palatinate brand has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the controversial post-delivery issue had derailed the future of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed to have features such as a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include its long maintenance period - new frigates from home ports should be disposable for two years.
However, the constant delay meant that cutting-edge warships should have been able to show Germany's power abroad but would have become obsolete by the time they entered service, Die Zeit notes.
The weak F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to approve the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a shipbuilder back after delivery.
Little was said about the reasons behind the ship's return, but German media cited some significant "software and hardware flaws" that rendered a warship sent on a war mission useless.
The software drawbacks were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg-class battleships would be operated by a sailor crew of about 120, this manpower being only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
Furthermore, it has also been found that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Pfalz" is believed to be as heavy as the Edge-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project including crew training is also becoming a problem.
It is said that the initial cost of the project has increased from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problem of new frigates has become particularly important given the recent warnings of a decline in German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the Navy was actually "going through a shortage of deployment-capable ships".
The official said the issue was heated over time as the old ships were removed but no vessels were delivered.
He said with sadness that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
National Trust EventsDrops on the Secret Life of Bets
A new research conducted on real estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to understand how bats use the landscape to search for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed new light on the behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will include common and soprano pipestriles in the Inverve Gardens of Wester Ross as well as brown long-eared and dowbinton squid.
Special recorders will be placed at the main locations around the property to track the activities of the skydivers throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the leatherback's sound and what species are doing.
A habitat map and report will then be prepared to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dever, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to better define the benefits such as the creation of grassland and how best to preserve the woodlands for skunks and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the population of bats has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development works that damage their routes and habitats.
Wind turbulence and lighting can also pose a risk, some chemical treatment of flypapers and building materials as well as attacks by pet cats are also a risk.
Squirrels are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a modern eco-location technique to point out errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks across the country and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamachidia very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who conduct surveys regularly, inspect resting places and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated leatherback reserve area at the Threeway Estate in Drumfriese and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten leatherback species.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is an ideal area for them.
We have developed a nice area for leather at Threew, he said.
We have found old buildings, many old trees and very good habitats.
But there is still a lot about that leather that is still unknown, so what we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about how to move forward".
He stressed the importance of checking for cataracts before carrying out maintenance in the property as the potential unintended destruction of a single miscarriage could wipe out 400 female and young cataracts, possibly the entire local population.
Leatherhead is protected and it is illegal to kill, maim or harass them or destroy their roast.
Scottish official of the Bath Conservation Trust Elizabeth Farrell has encouraged people to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our squid and many of its species", she said, "we don't even know how their population is growing".
Ronaldo denied the rape claim as well as the lawyers suing the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying Ronaldo that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, the magazine's allegations.
In 2009, in a hotel room in Las Vegas, Portugal and Juventus forward Ronaldo were accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorca.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, according to a report released by Der Spiegel on Friday.
Hours after the claim was reported, Ronaldo, 33, addressed 14.2 million fans in an Instagram live video, calling the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
"What they print today is fake news", said Ronaldo, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner, in front of the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
And that's normal.
They want to make my name famous by printing it, but this is part of the business.
I am happy and all is well", Ronaldo said with a smile.
According to Reuters, the group's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, a report they described as "inappropriate reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schartz said the player will compensate for the damage to the moral image that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her by committing an act of self-deception, according to papers filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and only "one percent" a bad guy.
Documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she had gone to the police and she had even taken photographs of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared of change" and "worried of being publicly humiliated".
34-year-old Mayorga says she now wants to cancel the settlement as she is constantly being shocked by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged persecution, and this summer moved to the Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will 'always regret' losing its status as a carmaker
If the UK loses its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit, it will "always regret it", said Business Secretary Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "important" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily cease production at its factory in Bernston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clarke said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of the no-deal Brexit event could take the toll on jobs.
Toyota's Oris and Avenson-based Barnstone plant produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the European Union.
I think if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down, said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Bernaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern over the fear of leaving the EU, saying how the cross-border business including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover will function as they leave the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
In the case of no-deal Brexit, car manufacturers say that supply chain risk is a major concern.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis for car orders from both the UK and the European Union, and parts are delivered from suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border and, according to industry, it could lead to a shortage and delays in parts.
The company said that it is not possible to keep more than one day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production will be discontinued.
Mr. Clarke said the Theresa May Checker Plan for future relations with the EU was "designed specifically to avoid checks on the border".
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We need a deal. We want to make the best deal, to take advantage of this opportunity with the success we have now.
Evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers says that we need to be fully capable of continuing a highly successful supply chain.
He could not say how long Toyota production would be shut down but he warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually create a risk to jobs.
Peter Sowelaris, who has worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is a United Union Conveyor at the plant, said that its members' concerns are constantly growing: "In my experience once these jobs are gone, they will never come back.
"We have presented a definitive and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU", the Government spokesperson said.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will be "postponed for another week" as the Supreme Court continues to debate nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the relationship between Trump supporters and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
There has been a rumor in the streets of Washington for months about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and whether that will jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wore a wire to record a conversation with Trump and discussed the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, reportedly, and he resigned.
Instead of meeting Trump, it was announced on Thursday who will be at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "didn't like to fire Rosenstein" but delayed the meeting to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which included testimony from both Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women accused of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh for a week, with further delays in the full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "The date has not been set, it could be this week, I think that if all the attention is focused on matters concerning the Supreme Court, it will be put back another week.
However, we will see and I always prefer to keep the press informed".
Some journalists objected that Sanders had not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
Anchor Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders said the reason not to do the briefings was not to "outrage" TV reporters. He added, "I don't disagree with the fact that they were outraged".
He then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
She said the current president has had more Q&A sessions than any previous president. She added without providing evidence: "We know the numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would still take place, but "if the press gets a chance to ask a direct question to the president of the United States, it's a lot better than talking to me".
We try to do that and you see what we've done a lot in the last few weeks and you can talk to the President of the United States when a press briefing is held".
Trump regularly answers questions from reporters when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or attending a press conference with visitors.
However, a single press conference is rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have said why journalists assumed a strange situation and behaved recklessly before they met.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland about the fear of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff to express the country's gratitude to the staff working in the NHS in Scotland and to express their wish to remain post-Brexit.
GAN Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to covering the costs of applying permanent status to EU citizens working in its dedicated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving were underway and the decision was expected by this fall.
But the UK government is also moving forward in its preparation for a potential no-deal situation.
I know that this is a very unpleasant time for all of us.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I attach great importance to the contributions of each member of staff regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the European Union have contributed their valuable experience and expertise to strengthen the functioning of healthcare and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here".
Kristen Abercrombie has undergone immediate surgery after severe head injuries.
Tennessee's Mike Organ reports that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a serious head injury during a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
He retreated to the side and fell down, Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave him Abercrombie oxygen before placing him on the stretcher and took him for further examination.
Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, a Tennessee State official said the surgery was performed at Vanderbilt Medical Center in Abercrombie.
Harris added that "no details have yet been found of the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is his first season with Tennessee State since Redshirt Sophomore moved from Abercrombie, Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before leaving the game on Saturday, with a total of 18 tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a high stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a high stamp duty to buy a property to help the homeless with extra cash under the new Tory Plan using extra cash in the UK.
This move will undo the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on non-payers of taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects it will be able to raise up to £120m a year in this way to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a high stamp duty with extra cash used to help the homeless when buying property in the UK, which Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to derail the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to target young voters with cheaper housing and high-income earners.
The additional money will be used to accelerate the government's campaign to tackle rough sleeping, with an increase in stamp duty on non-taxable individuals and companies in the UK.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which may include the high level introduced on selling a second home and buying two years ago and can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects this to generate up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to buy a home.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers and spend most of their time outside the country.
Boris Johnson has said that the new policy has been introduced to help more young people buy their first home.
She accused large construction companies of raising the floor by occupying the property to keep property prices high, and Theresa May urged Britain to abandon quotas on cheap homes to fix Britain's "housing disregard".
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including rental restrictions and the evacuation of "no-fault" occupancy.
He wants to give more power to the committee to build new houses.
Theresa May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restore the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means we must fix the broken housing market.
For those who want to live, work and build a life here, Britain will always be open to those who do.
However, it is not entirely appropriate that it is as easy for a hardworking UK resident to buy a home as it is for individuals who do not live in the UK and work for companies based abroad.
For many people, the dream of buying a house has become rare and sleeping in a rented house is becoming a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My final wish is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate wish" is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scott is taking up the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in League One, with the top three points.
He disappeared from the stadium this summer after guiding St Mirren back to last season's Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But I grew up watching my father play Scotland in Hampden as a child, and that always keeps me back.
That opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in the management of the club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he doesn't feel any pain in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected proposals from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
'If I can get this club back to the Premier League, can I succeed at this moment?
Due to the structure and facilities at this club, it is undoubtedly positioned in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task to get it, but only if I can take the club back there will I find myself successful here.
Ross has only been in his management career for three years, at Dumberton he has worked for 15 months as an assistant boss and on the coaching staff of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa regain a three-tier reputation, and the following season led St Mirren to the championship title.
And Ross says he has now felt more comfortable than his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
And he took charge of the alloy, and said, It was a life-saving vessel.
I really believed that management was more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds strange because I've made it right, lived a decent life out of it, and enjoyed some decent goals.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you have to watch on a weekly basis.
I still go through that workload and pressure but management seems pretty good.
I always wanted to manage and now that I do, it feels most comfortable to myself throughout my entire life".

The best time for paint is Saturday at 5.30 pm, the survey said.
The summer heat wave has boosted revenue for Britain's struggling pub but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bar groups saw sales increase by 2.7 per cent in July, but restaurants saw a decline in revenue by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy CGA who compiled the figures said: "The pattern of last month's June in July was continuing due to the constant heat of the sun and England's longer participation in the World Cup than expected, with pubs up 2.8 percent, while restaurants hit even harder.
The downturn in restaurant sales of 1.8 per cent in June was worse in July.
The restaurants that went down in sales did the best business with the drink-based pubs and bars.
A food-based pub has also suffered heat damage, although it was not as severe as the restaurant operators.
It meant that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drink sales in operated pubs and bars increased 6.6 percent in a month, while food sales declined by three percent".
Lesur & Hospitality analyst RSM Paul Newman said: "These results have been a trend we have been continuously observing since the end of April.
The weather and the effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling in the outdoor market.
It is not surprising that despite the ongoing conflict between restaurant groups, a continuing decline in sales of 4.8 per cent on an annual basis, especially on the ongoing price pressures, will leave a worse impact.
The long hot summers should not be a bad time for the food industry and the time will tell how much relief we will get from the moderate temperatures we now experience in August".
Total sales growth of pubs and restaurants including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slow decline in brand roll-outs.
The Coffee Pitch Tracker monitors sales of the coffee industry for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector and collects and analyses data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of 9 billion British pounds and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children have private social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a private social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, the survey found.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a "fake Insta" page
There has been increased fear in the news that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they had a "major" account to show parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, has a private social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapidly growing "fake Insta" page - in reference to photo sharing site Instagram.
There has been a growing fear in the news that sexual content is being posted.
20 percent of students said they have a "major" account to show parents when they also have another private account.
A mother saw her 13-year-old daughter blow up a mysterious site, and the teenager begged the other to "rape" her.
Research by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them holding private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "Many teenagers are distracted by finding online places where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elith Doyle will be "the voice for athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Aaliyah Doyle has been elected as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian BTA described the move as a great opportunity for guidance seekers to take advantage of his extensive experience internationally over the past decade.
Elith is widely respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from bringing him on board.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to working as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and guide the sport in Scotland".
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has a total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was unable to walk due to a momentary Ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't run.
The doctors said that only time can tell how much I will recover.
She had to work hard but she has fully recovered, learned how to walk and is now doing a full-blown exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Online opinions differ in breast pump advertising compared to maternal cows.
The breast pump company has shared an online opinion with the ad and compared the care of cows' milk from mothers.
To launch the so-called "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer tech company LV introduced a tang-in-chic music video-inspired ad, expressing the mother's freedom to show off the new pump.
Four real mothers dance on a track in a village with cow's milk spread out in the street and sing: "Yes, I give myself milk, but you don't see a tail" and "Yes, you may not see a spleen, it's my breast".
The chorus goes on: "Pump her, pump her, I'm feeding her children, pump her, pump her, I'm breastfeeding my women".
However, the ad posted on the firm's Facebook page has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed response from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "terror" of the dairy industry.
There has been a lot of wrong decision to use cows to advertise this product.
She is pregnant and gives birth to children, and her children are separated from her in the days of her birth".
The elvy breast pump fits perfectly within the nursing bra (elvy/mother).
Another commented: "This is a huge shock to both mother and child.
But yes, why don't mothers who have their children use a breast pump ad?"
Another added: "This is an out-of-touch ad".
Another defends the ad, a woman admitting that she liked the song "Hilerius".
I think this is a genius idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would need it.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This is a bit of a crazy ad, but it seems to me to be what it is.
This is a genius product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is an entertaining ad aimed at those who pump (often in their workplace or toilets) and look like cows to moms.
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were all dancing with smart pumps placed in their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the understanding that many women who pump breasts say they look like cows.
However, the Alvy pump, is quite silent, has no wires or tubes and fits quite well inside a nursing bra, which gives women freedom to roam, hold their children and even go outside while pumping.
Mother's partner and ECD Anna Banarin commented: "The LV Pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and aggressive launch.
By painting a parallel between women and dairy cows expressing, we want to bring breast pumping and all its challenges into the public eye, and show it entertainingly and clearly that this new pump brings an amazing sense of liberation.
This is not the first time that Elvie Pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two used the product to catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
Although the number of detained migrant children has increased, the proportion of monthly border crossing has not changed, as the harsh rules introduced by the Trump administration and policies have made it difficult to put children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and they are fearful of their ability to stay in the country by moving on to claim those children.
In June, federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials, raising the risk with this announcement.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Matthew Albans confessed to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor numerous citizens.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested have no prior criminal records.
About 80 percent of the sponsors or household members are living in the country illegally, and most of them have criminal connections.
So we continue to push those individuals' steps", Albanes said.
To speed up the proceedings of the children, the authorities introduced new rules that some of them would have to appear in court within a month of detention, which earlier, as the shelter workers said, was 60 days.
Many immigration judges will meet by video conference call, rather than individual, to request their case for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit for relief will be discharged quickly.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent clashes or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports emerging from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that there are concerns about a large facility like Tornillo where the number of children is more likely to be neglected.
He added that moving to a tent city without giving enough time to prepare the children emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can shock many people who are already struggling.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkish to withdraw 'occupying forces' immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'uleem also urged Syrian refugees to return despite the country's eight-year war.
Maullam, who also served as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces have been illegally seized Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "it will be fairly judged".
They must return immediately and without any conditions, he told the Assembly.
Maullam stressed that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus will continue to wage this war until we have cleared all areas of Syria for the presence of both terrorist organizations and any illegal foreign presence".
The United Nations has around 2,000 troops in Syria, providing training and advice to both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugee problem, Moallem said that the conditions were good for them to return, and he accused some Western countries of spreading unreasonable fear that forced the refugees to flee.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely human problem.
The United Nations and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be provided to Syria until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in one of the last strongholds of the Idlib rebels has provided an opportunity to push forward political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal stalled a major potential attack on a province by Russian-aligned forces in Syria, where three million people live.
However, Ma'aleem stressed that the agreement set clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including Nusra fighters affiliated with al-Qaeda, who would be killed".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of the new committee, made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Mauleem drafted the terms for participation in the Syrian government committee, which said that the line's work should be limited enough to review the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win Another Session
By that logic, Mr Trump will be able to win re-election in 2020 unless, the scandal and scandal finishes your presidency ahead of time, which many liberal viewers are probably hoping for.
There is no doubt that there will be a dramatic presidential final as never before!"
So far, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the President-Time rating has more than doubled from 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, the prime time viewership of Focus News averages 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Mado Show has been the number one cable ratings on prime time news nights with nearly 3.5 million viewers.
This is a fire that people are drawn to because it is not something we understand, said Neil Bair, who runs the ABC drama's Desiignated Drama Show, about a Cabinet Secretary who becomes president after the devastating attack on the assembly building.

By the way, unlike anything that comes on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of RoV, Wade, whether immigrant families can get together and the health of the global economy.

And yet, as an informed citizen, you'll go further when you see yourself at six o'clock, a line of experts discussing the effects of a deep background for Bob Woodward's book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 eye-catching leather bomber jacket (a thick dress with a hat, a Washington Post) and Mr. Trump's, um, silly description of the stormy Daniels of bodybuilding.

Outside wealth is coming to the brink of a tight medieval election house.
It is no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th is experiencing a flood of wealth, thanks to the rebuilding of congressional districts that brought two pedestrians to the same seat.
These recently redesigned suburbs outperform Pittsburgh District Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th District of old Pennsylvania, which is tightly tied with the new 17.
The maps were redrawn after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court that the old districts were secularly run in favor of the Republicans.
The competition, which is taking place on the 17th, has touched the campaign finance slugfest between the major party's financial planners, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania for the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania, winning a narrow margin in a wide-ranging special election in March.
That seat retained a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a little bit more edge.
The US imposed a fine on El Salvador for cooperating with China, then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a steady withdrawal from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varella, in June and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management 2017 team.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of US diplomatic missions following the current decision not to recognize Taiwan from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama, Department spokeswoman Heather Nauret said in a statement earlier this month.
But the idea of the fine is only against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic cooperation.
The proposed penalties, which included deductions on financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials backtracked on a high-level convention focused on security and economic prosperity similar to last year's meeting that was seen as a step toward efforts to stop people from migrating to the United Nations.
But by mid-September, senior management officials had made it clear that they wanted the convention to proceed, effectively ending any idea of sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomats said that Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which will be held in mid-October to bring together the administration to signal imports.
And three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal thought dispute on condition of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to management and they also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Bible is a book of history.
The footprint can then be laid on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstacles to Mr Trump's justice, which is now well documented in public records.
It is reported that Mr Muller is also turning his research to whether Mr Trump's campaign coincided with the attack on Russia's presidential election.
Should Congress change hands, Mr Trump himself will face responsibility in that system as he prepares to go again against the voters and perhaps eventually a panchayat of his allies.
There are many possibilities, and my suggestion is not that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable - that he is not even in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have choices to make that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready for a coup against Hitler, only if the West had stopped him and backed the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to stop the genocide in the years to come.
Such breakaway points are the direction of the foundations of history and the slow movement of democracy.
Americans now face some of these breaking points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Law Officer Rod Rosenstein, who is the person controlling the future of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosenstein has been plagued by problems ever since the paper reported that last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his inability to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' account is inaccurate.
How will we respond if the F.B.I. investigation under new request by Brett Kavanagh is not complete or consistent - or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite reliable allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote for Congress to mediate that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in those tests, democracy will last for a long winter.
But I do not expect to be denied anything because of the things I learned in Prague.

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic ahead of the race against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that following an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, Austria's victory over the G-League would put them in a strong position to qualify from the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrance from making his first appearance until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal in the season but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for the greatest things.
It was a good point for us because Villarial is a good side, the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game thinking we could get something and came up with a point.
Maybe we could have won it near the end, but a draw was probably a good result.
They were probably good in the first half and we came in the second half and were on the better side.
Let's go to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully, we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because he had a good result in the last game but, with the backing of the crowd with us, I am sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, all the things that happened like my injuries and the changes in the club itself are also a factor that makes the space feel good now.
The group is good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
Hopefully, we can move forward now, and we can succeed by leaving the past season behind us".

Although survey participants had no idea how they wanted to be cared for, some people talked about it with their family members.
Nearly half of the individuals in the national level study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said they have spoken to their children about it.
People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to communicate, said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide's Life Insurance business.
This is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for the day-to-day needs of your family unless you know what you want ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important component in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor may also come to your aid for a way to pay those expenses.
Your fund choices for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance plan, a cash-value combination life insurance plan to cover these expenses, or a self-insurance plan with your own property as long as you have money.

The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, with death toll expected to rise.
Due to the communication shutdown, relief officials have not been able to obtain any information about Donggala region north of Palua, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palou, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated since the devastation.
Here are some key facts about the Palu and Dongala affair, on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a coastal sovereign territory over 300 km (180 mi) in the viaduct of Sulawesi Island.
The administered territory, an administrative region that is below the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowli, on the opposite shore of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agencies, Palau and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis on several occasions over the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Dongola.
A tsunami also struck West Donga in 1996, and was a victim of the tsunami.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire in an earthquake-like manner and is hit by regular earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake in Asieh province of North Sumatra on the west coast of Indonesia triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people living along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Asieh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Some hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, giving rise to a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Pradesh.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Behind Sumatra, a 7.5 magnitude tsunami struck one of the Mantawai Islands, triggering a 10m tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shadowy earthquake hits the Pdi Jaya Autonomous Region of Asie, causing damage and drowsiness as people recall the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but the buildings that collapsed killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sara Paline's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
The eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sara Palin, is arrested for the attack.
According to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troops, Pauline, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report and obstructing arrest.
According to the police report, when a female companion tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, they took her phone from her.
Paulin is being questioned in the pre-match-su trial facility and held on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges, the network noted.
Pauline is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which carry a jail sentence of one day and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sara Paliin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Appeals.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, one count of domestic violence and one count of possession of a weapon in a drunken state.
His girlfriend alleged that he had punched her in the face.
Sara Paline was criticized in 2016 by a group of veterans after associating her son's misbehavior with PTSD after her service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: several hundred killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake has triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake just struck the back of central Sulawesi, which lies to the north of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of shock.
When the tsunami struck the coast, a crowd of about a hundred people gathered to the beach festival in the city of Palos.
Federal lawyers are demanding a rare death sentence for NYC terror suspects.
Federal lawyers in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sephulo Saipow, a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people - a rare sentence the state has never handed out for a federal crime since 1953.
The Home Depot, 30, allegedly used a rental truck to attack a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, to drive pedestrians and cyclists on its way to Oct.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify a death sentence, lawyers must prove that Cypowe intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally injured them severely.
According to the court document, both of those reasons provide for a possible death sentence.
Weeks after the attack, a federal Mahabharata Panchayat charged Saipov with 22 counts including eight counts of murder with treason, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime prosecutions, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and pre-determination", describing how Sipov acted in a "disgusting, cruel and deprived" manner, the lawyers said.
The objective of the NTI is to inform the Syffoullou Habbullevik Saipowe of the injuries, injuries and damage suffered by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clavis, Anne Laurie Decat, Darren Drake, Eril Erlize, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mondeza and the families and friends of Alejandro Damián Panchocco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been nearly a decade since the Southern District of New York carried out a death penalty trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted and sentenced to death two years ago on charges of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during a Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A native of Saipov, Uzbekistan, has expressed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
According to the allegation, Saipow told the officials that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patten, one of the federal public defender's lawyers representing Sipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
Patten said, "We think that demanding the death penalty, rather than accepting a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the shock of these events for everyone involved.
The Defence Forces of Saipov had earlier asked lawyers not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farrah should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During a protest at the Tory Convention today Nigel Ferrez offered to rally the people's army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had experienced a warmth from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that she should be in charge of EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, a conservative backbencher, said in Birmingham in March that if Mr. Ferage had been Brexit Secretary the UK would have 'gone out' by now.
But the challenge Ms May is facing to regain her deeply divided position is outlined by pro-Riman Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The president is struggling to maintain his plan to settle his checks amid Brexiters, reminers and EU attacks.
The colleagues stressed that despite the strong negative reaction, she will continue to try to negotiate with Brussels - and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its support and its disruption.
Mr. Bone said that if you leave the rally in Solihill, then leave it because he wanted the chequerers to be removed.
You suggested that Mr. Ferrage should be made an ally and given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
'If they had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
MP from Wellingboro added: "I will support Brexit but we need to get rid of the checker".
In his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight to remain a World War.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected the suggestion that the 2016 vote had changed the public's minds. The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.
Andria Jenkins with the Tory Brexit was also in the march, telling reporters: "I'm simple: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The checker is not known to the general public, the opponents are not going to vote for him, it is unusual for our group and our workers who actually work on the streets and help us get elected in the first place.
Please put down the horns and start listening.'
In a directed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Shri Feraj said rally politicians should do something to feel warmth if they want to cheat on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a matter of trust between our people - and our political class,' he said.
'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not leave you after that.'
He sent a message to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to create our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel warm.
'We are uniting an army of people from this country who won us Brexit and who will not surrender until we become an independent, self-governing, sovereign United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, survivors marched through Birmingham before setting up a two-hour parade in the city centre.
After the group's launch this weekend, a chapel of activists unfurled banners of the Tories against Brexit.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis mocked the conservatives with a party app for the security issues he was bothered with as the convention opened.
'These are the people who tell us that they can put systems in place and all the technologies for Canada plus plus to have a frictionless border, so that free trade without borders in Ireland can happen,' he said.
'It is a complete comedy.
There is nothing like a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to make a strict watch for the president's election.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "take a hard look at President Matteney's duties" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Deale, who was Trump's co-chairman of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She may have been at the center of speculation that she will go against Trump in 2020.
The afternoon event in Holyock on Saturday was the 36th meeting of Trump with components using the Town Hall format after taking office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to rebuild our broken government, and that covers the fact that a woman is on top".
Arrested to death by firing squad of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dixon Simson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
He released a video asking for help identifying a man seen in footage on Friday.
Sims 20, shot and killed near South University Patangan earlier on Friday.
Wade was shot in the head by a gunman at Sims and eventually died, police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, 247 Sports.
Wade came to the rescue of his friend and Simpson was shot dead by Wyde.
Simmons was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, armed, and Wade admitted to shooting Sims.
Simmons was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 small forward who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with the Sims, earning 10 stars last season and averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton won the world title by winning against Sebastian Vettel on the orders of the team
It became clear for the moment that when Valteri Botas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, that the team would play a big part in the Mangoel A Mercedes race.
From Paul, Bottas got off to a good start and hung Hamilton out to dry almost as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Wettle to attack his group mate.
Wettle moved to Pitts first and left Hamilton in a traffic jam in the tail of quantity, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes later struck a lap and came behind the wheel, but Hamilton moved on after a few wheel-to-wheel action that saw a Ferrari driver leave unhappy inside who was free of the risk of holding after a double-movement to the third corner for defense.
Max Worstup started from the back row of the grid on his 21st birthday and came seventh at the end of the first round.
He then relied on his tires for a fourth to achieve a fast finish goal and move past Kimi Raikkonen to lead a large part of the race.
In the 44th circle he finally came into the trenches, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight circles as Raycon took fourth.
It's a difficult day because Voltaire did a great job on the weekend and I was told by a real gentleman.
The team did an exceptional job of having one or two, Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein on Saturday for insisting she did not crack down on a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing her of sexual harassment of Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanagh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly comment on Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were selfish and evil and false".
One thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and selfish and bad and untruthful, he said.
When you see releases and leaks and then they say, oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do this.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember the answer to that... did you leak the document - oh oh where?
Oh, no. I was just...
I didn't leak it".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak, we linked it to the influence of the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter by Ford in late July describing the charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied the leak was from his office.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak his words, Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
And she said to me, Keep it secret; and I kept it secret, as I told her.
But she showed no refusal to sit down with the president, who commented at a Saturday night rally: What I'm telling you, was extremely bad body language.
Maybe it wasn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Furthering the defense of a High Court practitioner accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President indicated that Democrats are using the allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to recover the necessary energy in any way.
You can see that they are selfish, they are panicked, they do not care who they are hurting, they have to run for power and control.

The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are in their next game at Milton Keynes home on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die trying to save thousands of people from earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after his death, it was determined that he had secured a safe takeoff of a plane carrying thousands of people.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a major earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday, which has prompted a tsunami.
Serious aftershocks can destroy the area and are trapped under the rubble in many of the Palo-Cities.
After his colleagues escaped, 21-year-old Anthony Guinvan Agungé Mutiyaara Siss Al Jufri Airport, Palu Airport, also in serious condition, refused to leave his post in the Dolta Control Tower.
He was also working to ensure that Battic Air Flight 6321 on the runway can safely take off.
When he saw the control tower collapsing, he jumped from it.
Then she died in hospital.
An Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman said that Johannes Sirit said the decision could save thousands of lives, ABC News reported in Australia.
We had prepared a helicopter to take us from Kalimantan to another large hospital in the city.
Unfortunately, we lost it just before we arrived at Pallu by helicopter this morning.
"We are so saddened to hear this", he added.
Meanwhile, officials feared that death toll could reach thousands, speaking to the country's Disaster Reduction Agency, saying that the towns of Dongla, Sighi and Butong are out of reach.
Sutopo Pura Nugraha, spokesperson of the agency, said that while many people have not been reached, it is believed that many of the bodies are still buried under the rubble.
Waves up to six metres high have destroyed the Palu, with a mass burial ceremony to take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Reza Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
Pure water is rare.
Every minute, the mini market is being looted.
Jan Gelfende, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors, but we don't know what will be found there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I urge all of you to work day and night, as the work related to the Nakramana can be completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
In Indonesia, an earthquake struck in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Nugini now says a person has been missing since the plane crash of the Legan
A single-line flight of the Pacific Lagoon crashed in Micronesia, now showing one person missing, while all 47 passengers and crew were said to have escaped safely from the sinking aircraft.
The Air Newgin said in a statement that the account was unavailable to the male passenger till noon on Saturday.
The airline said that the work was being done with local authorities, hospital and investigators in an effort to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
In an attempt to land at Chuak Island Airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane ran aground.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and their condition was stable at the time.
For the plague hath come to pass, and the order of the things is not known.
Both the airlines and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the runway's lagoon short.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane would overshot the runway.
American traveler Bill Janice said the plane had landed extremely low.
This is a good thing, says Janice.
Janice said he and others managed to escape by crossing water up to the waist for emergency exports on the sinking plane.
The flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and they were also minorly injured.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors repairing nearby shores also assisted with rescues using inflatable boats to rescue people before the plane sank in water as much as 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from Aviation Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but this is not an underlying issue for Air Nuggini.
An analyst of the night timeline shows that the woman was burned alive.
In a reconsideration petition, the prosecution heard a verdict in the case on Saturday, accusing a woman from Mississippi of burning alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He mentioned before the jury how he used his cellphone records to link together pieces of the activities of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said they obtained location data from several cell phones, which contradicts previous claims by Teles that Teles was with her on the night of Chamber's death.
When the data showed that he had a cell phone with Chambers, he told her that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford took the stand and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the plaintiffs asked if he was in the truck with Sanford that night, whether Tallis was telling the truth, he said that he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Telis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cellphone records indicated that the couple had known each other for a week.
Rolette said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles removed the text, call and contact information from his phone.
He wiped her out of his life, Hal said.
His final arguments are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said he hopes to take the charges to the jury later that day.
Upper class: What is awakened hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative outlook by filling their music with positive messages.
The upper class from Bristol claimed that the hip hop movement had moved away from its roots of political messages and settling communal issues.
They want to go back to their roots and re-populate conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a revival in the UK through artists such as Akala and Loki.
A more black person?!
NY Nanny sued the couple after a racist text
After receiving inappropriate text stating that she was another white person, the mother complained, a New York nanny couple is being discriminated against for dismissing a job.
The couple denied being their racist, likening the claim to a money-collection.
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed to learn that new babysitter Gisele Morris was asleep on her first day of work in 2016.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
However, she sent virgin Morris twice instead of sending her husband.
According to the New York Post, an uncomfortable Placebo-Félixman fired Ms. Morris after realizing her mistake, saying that the current nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad thing and she expected the Filipinos to replace her.
A young man named Maurice was begged for his day's work and sent home with a bowl.
Now, Morris is suing for damages to fire the couple, and has been seeking $350 per day for six months, initially hiring her for housing work, but without a probation.
I want to show you, look, you can't do that, she told the post on Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination".
Responding to claims that the couple were racist, he said that it was right to terminate Morris' employment, fearing that they could not trust him after insulting him.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists, President Joel Plasco told the Post.
But could you put your child in the hands of someone you thought was wrong, even if he did?
What about your newborn baby?
Let me go".
Comparing the charges to a money-collection lawsuit, Plasco said his wife was months away from having a baby and she was going through a very difficult time".
You go after someone, like that?
This is not a good thing, the investment banker said.
Although the legal process is still ongoing, the court of the people has reacted quickly to the couple's condemnation on social media, blaming their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington's publishers feared that the reader would not associate with a talking bear, the new letter published.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put the first-time reader in the seed before publication.
With Paddington's great success, we now know that this is very surprising".
Says that her father, who was inspired to write a children's book by a small toy bear, had previously worked as a BBC cameraman, joking about quitting his job, told her that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was Bittersweet, after which he died last year.
Paddington, who is considered an important member of her family, said her father was proud of her potential success.
He was a very quiet person, and he wasn't a suicidal person, she said.
But because Paddington wasn't very real to them, it was like, if you have a child who's accomplished something: you're proud of it, even if it's not actually doing your job.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his own design and imagination, he always credited it to Paddington".
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon discharging her daughter, she was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to show her life.
Ned always called to say that it was really bad, because he didn't expect it to succeed, Ms. Eden-Laperoy said.
Then I got a call from Ned that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
You will be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
Doctors gave her medications to pump her heart, which was slowly losing its effect and leaving her system.
She had recently given up the body and all this was over.
Even though I knew all this, I had to sit there and wait for him.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I really had to take care of it".
Ante Mrs. Adnan-Laperhouse became ill on the plane with other passengers, grieving the loss of her daughter - unaware of the mental anguish she was suffering.
No one knew, she said.
I was head down and crying all the time.
It's hard to understand, but it was on the flight, I felt this heavy feeling of compassion for Ned.
That he had the capacity for my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Victims post-cards to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries are posting an inspirational message and a phone number on the Nyseth Whelan Bridge, which people can call to get their support.
Mrs. Davis's son Tyler was 13 years old, from where he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
I don't want any parent to have to experience what I experience every day, she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, told her that her son was a promising chef with a bright smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his memory illuminated any room".
However, before his death, he quit his job, as it was "in a very dark place".
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler's brother was looking for his brother who committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I am constantly worried that there is going to be a handshake on influence".
Mrs. Davis handed out a card to show people that there are many people they can go to and talk to, even if they are not friends.
Do not be silent - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphries, who has been happy with Ms. Davis for years, said that shortly after Mark's mother died, she lost her 15-year-old partner Mark.
Never tell him that he feels sad or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas we saw a change in her character.
He was so devastated on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, they didn't even see him in front of you or anything".
Her death was a major shock to her, but she has to work on it: "It's a hole in the family.
This separates us.
But we all have to move forward and keep fighting".

The future of Kuwanwad was in doubt as the FBI began its search.
He said, "I thought we could actually get what he wanted - a limited time of search, limited scope of work - maybe we could bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, expressing his concern that the committee has become biased and has been stuck in gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kannanuagh and his Republican supporters not like the FBI's investigation?
They have a desire because of time.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, November 6 - If, as expected, the Republican does poorly, he will be disrupted in his efforts to elect his desired man to the highest court.
George W. Bush was calling the senators, he was parading them for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who had been to the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
There will be a vow in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is still unclear whether Shri Kanganagan will get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will break the tie and secure approval for Mike Pence to become the Vice President for the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea under Kim decreased
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has declined.
Park Byung-seog, Ministry of Integration of South, cited the figures and said that there were 1,127 refugees in the previous year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Shri Park said the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high tariffs imposed by smugglers were the main reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The large number of refugees from the North are being presented with South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The largest number of refugees came through China, which has the largest border with North Korea and is easier to cross between the two Koreas in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) high defence.
China takes refugees as unacceptable illegal immigrants, and often forcibly sends you back.
North-South relations - which are still technically war-like - have improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a conversation, which focused on the topic of contained nuclear weapons.
This followed a historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June, when they broadly agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Re said that without any confidence in America, our national security will not be trusted, and in such situations, there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the nature of self-indulgence in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on an revelation at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I can't help but think that if any woman ever demonstrated like this, she would have said "historically", Pelosi said in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kangana's testimony.
Kwananuga emotionally denied the allegations that she sexually assaulted Dr. Kristin Blesley Ford while they were both in their teens.
Talking about his family and high school, Kavanaugh was very emotional at the time of his initial statement, often speaking almost out loud and getting throated.
He explicitly denounced the Democrats in the committee that unfairly denounced the allegations of violent and coordinated character assassination by liberals, which led to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said he believes that Kannanuagh's testimony proves that he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, as it makes clear that he is biased against the Democrats.
"I think he has disqualified himself, with the statements and style in which he followed Clinton and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed doubt on whether she would attempt to launch a plea on Kannauga, if this were confirmed and if the Democrats were to succeed in securing a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will do it", Pelosi said, "if they are not showing reality to Congress or the FBI, it is not only in the Supreme Court but in the courts that it is appropriate to stay", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible outburst of the Right to Attend Act or Row v. Wade because it was a conservative justice in the human mind.
At his confirmation hearing, Kannanuagh ignored the question of whether he would overturn some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that this is not the time for the hysterical, partisan to go to court, and Amrathy hopes to say that this will not be very good.
And women need to do this.
This is a fitting review of the months and years of anger that she cannot get out without crying.
When we are angry we cry, Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is unusual, do you?
She went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an employee somewhere, who said that she was crying too, and when she got angry she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person in front of her who was talking to her, 'You think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I am angry".
And she just keeps moving forward.
And I think that was wise".
As part of the anger, tears are allowed as an export, because they are perceived as being fundamentally false.
One of my sharp memories from an early job in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying with untold anger, was that I was caught by a woman with a scar on my neck - a sharp manager, whom I was always a little afraid of - who pulled me up a ladder.
Never let them see you cry, she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
He thinks you are sad and rejoices because he has come to you".
Patricia Schroeder, who was the chairwoman of a Democratic Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for his presidency.
When Mr. Hart was caught in a boating affair called Monkey Business in 1987 and was then thrown out of the competition, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and felt that she should not consider running for president herself, there was no reason behind it.
After 30 years, she smiles and tells me that it was not a thoughtful decision.
There were already seven participants in the competition and the last thing they needed was one another.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was delayed, she was behind in raising money, and so she vowed not to participate in the contest until she had raised $2 million.
It was a defeated war.
She learned that some supporters, who gave the men $1,000, would only give her $250.
Did they think I was being dismissed?
When she announced in her speech that she would not run a formal campaign, she went out of her way to express her feelings - thanking the people who supported her, frustrating the system, making it difficult to raise money, and targeting voters and anger at gender discrimination in the place of representatives - she got caught up there.
You may have thought that I had a nervous breakdown, Mrs. Schroeder recalled how the press reacted to her.
You may have guessed that Kleneks was my professional sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
She cried?""
How can a US-China trade war be appropriate for Beijing
Experts believe that the early stages of the US-China trade war have been dire, and that long-term benefits for Beijing could increase until the war is over.
US President Donald Trump had issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key Chinese imports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant growth this week was the introduction of new tariffs, which will tax half of all goods imported from China into the US, affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of goods.
Beijing has called for a response every time, imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of goods in the same country.
China has promised a short-for-short match for America, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to hit fast.
To turn back Washington means to bow to the tide, but to bow publicly to the United States would be extremely shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing moves its way properly, the pressure of the US trade war could reduce the long-term positive support of China by reducing the interdependence of both economies.
"The fact is that Washington or Beijing can make an immediate political decision that could create situations that will trigger an economic telescope, or even actually make the country's previous spectators even more horrific", said Abigail Grass, a research associate at the Center for New American Security, which looks at Asia for a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready to send back refugees
Syria says it is willing to voluntarily return the refugees, and is appealing for help in rebuilding the country devastated by the seven-year war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'aleem said the situation in the country is improving.
He said that the soil is more stable and secure today to move forward in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing to resettle areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees in the country, who had to abandon the unilateral economic solution due to terrorism and the impact on their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian administration would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or sympathy from countries that sponsor extremism.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team America by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on the European continent and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe received the crown, as Denmark's captain Thomas Byrne's tally reached 14.5 points, their need to defeat the United Nations.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, threw his T-shirt into the water in the 16th hole Par-3 and won his match against Francisco Molinari.
Since the inception of the current format of the tournament in 1979, Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all his journeys, with 1 to 4 players outscored 5-0-0.
The lowest ranked player in the US Jordan Speed European team was knocked out by Denmark's Thorborn Oles with 5&4.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell 2 and 1 to England's Ian Polter, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the all-time European winner with 25.5 career points in the tournament.
I don't usually cry, but today I am sad.
This has been a difficult year.
So I thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
Feeling excited about the European victory, Garcia said that this is about the team and I am happy that I was able to help.
He takes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud, I grew up watching this man beat Tiger Woods", said Rahm, 23.
In France, Woods lost all four of his matches and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
The odd figure of one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA has struggled to get Fairways all week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf in the complete tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I am proud of these people, they fought.
This morning we were in a bit of heat in Europe.
We fought.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is the best captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will all be together once again, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 players very much and am proud to serve as captain.
You'll have to take off the top of your hat.
We went out".
