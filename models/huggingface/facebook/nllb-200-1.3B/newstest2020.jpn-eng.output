Driving on the highway is dangerous!
Younger people's footsteps are in the wrong (Auto Messe Web) - Yahoo!
道路交通法に抵触する違反行為
Although there has been increasing attention paid to reports of accidents caused by improper handling of pedestrians, such as pedestrian footsteps, it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem of elderly drivers.
In 2015 police agency data, the most frequent cases were reported in 1080 cases of people under 24 years of age and in 1032 cases of people over 75 years of age.
It is not common for older people to make mistakes, and it is important to pay attention to younger people as well.
Do you want to take a foot of the old?
You want security?
Although the data does not indicate any gender or cause, the data does not indicate any gender or cause, unlike older people, who are often thought to be caused by physical impairment such as driving skills or reflex nerves, and younger people, who are more concerned with other things such as music or conversation, and therefore may also be considered to be guilty of mistakes in clothing and other reasons.
Some women, especially, choose different shoes for themselves, such as in the case of the women of the day, such as in the case of the women of the day, such as in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the women of the day, in the case of the day, in the case of the day, in the case of the day, and of the day.
While many people know they are not fit to drive, or find it difficult to change shoes, many people drive without any thought to the potential for danger or with a bad attitude.
However, ・ハイヒールやサンダル driving in highways is contrary to the Road Traffic Act。
One is "to operate the handles, brakes and other operations with certainty" and "not to drive in a manner that would endanger the driver or other party to the accident" as defined in the 70th article "safety driving obligation violation".
And another is that, in Article 71 of the 71st article "Public Safety Committee Compliance with the Rules of the Public Safety Committee of each Tōdaido-shi Prefecture", which states that drivers must comply with the rules set by the Public Safety Committee of each Tōdaido-shi Prefecture, for example, in the 12th article of the Miyazaki Prefecture Road Traffic Law Implementation Rules, there is a sentence "You must not drive vehicles except light vehicles, wearing shoes that are impeding the operation of the highway or other shoes that impede the operation of the highway".
In the "Shoes that may interfere with driving operations" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way" in the "Two-way".
So, why is it so dangerous to drive on the highway?
It is obvious if you think about the basics of operating the pedal safely.
For safe sure pedal operation, you must first fix your foot on the bed, then tilt your foot to the right, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the bed, then tilt your foot to the right, then tilt your foot to the bed.
At this time, it is important to keep the car firmly fixed so that the brake does not break regardless of the vehicle's behaviour.
But, in the high hill, the area of the foot that the pedal touches the floor is small, and the foot always gets stuck in the gragra, and because the whole foot is angled at the height of the heel, the area of the foot that the pedal touches the floor is also small, so that it cannot be stepped firmly, and the fine adjustments are difficult.
This is thought to be associated with danger.
Also, most cars have floor carpeting, but this material is more likely to cause high-heeled shoes to be easily pulled over, sometimes when the heel is pulled over and the pedal does not step, or when the heel is pulled over, the heel is removed, or the heel is caught behind the pedal and the pedal does not step.
Furthermore, there are cases where, when stepping on the pedal and returning, the horse is pulled to the back of the pedal, and the horse is not returned.

"Beauty and Evil" is a paper one?
図かずお作品の美少女たちに重なる『ヘビ』のイメージとは(マグミクス ) - Yahoo!ニュース - Yahoo!
What do mystical beauty and 影を宿す facial expressions have in common?
図かずお先生 (玄光社) has been released in August 2019, focusing on the beautiful girls portrayed by 図かずお先生, known as the first person of the "恐怖マンガ" ("threat manga"), 図かずお先生 (図かずお先生) has released several works since the 1950s.
When you look at it in your hand and you see it, you are again aware of the correlation between the "beauty" and "horror" of 図かずお作品.
 画像  " 影 "                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
図かずお作品の美少女たち(5枚)             
The opening chapter of the "美少女コレクション" also had a sentence that said, "The horror, ugliness, shocking scenes and developments of the story are also contrasted by their beauty, which stands out", but the beautiful face changes into a distorted, resentful expression of hatred ... ... ... because there is a contrast, perhaps "horror" stands out more.
Although many of the characters in the works of 図かずお have the keyword "蛇" as their main character, the serpent is perceived by those who see it as an "unpleasant creature" or the people who feel it as "beautiful" have different ways of seeing and receiving it.
There are people in the world who like reptiles, and there are people who are always in trouble.
Similarly, depending on the sensitivity of the viewer, "beautiful" and "ugly" may be the same creature as "snake".
This creature is also revered as a higher spiritual being than the ancients, and the house where the "白蛇" lives is said to bring good luck.
There are some 図作品 that have the theme of "その"蛇" ̋, such as "へび少女" or "まだらの少女" from the 1965 "ママがこわい!" series ̋.
If you want to become a "beautiful woman", you have to be a "beautiful woman".
If I say イマドキな言い方をすれば『クールビュティー』タイプとも言えるだろうか ... ... ... I feel like it's the common point of the beautiful girls who appear in the works of 図書。
But, even though the main character of the "おろち" series, which was serialized in the "週刊少年サンデー" from 1969 to 1969, "おろち" is a representative of the "美少女キャラ" works, but to preserve eternal life and eternal youth, it is necessary to go into deep sleep every hundred years, or parts with miraculous powers, etc. Somewhere "serpent" is suggested.

14/9/1924// The oil facilities of the largest oil company in Saudi Arabia, 'サウジアラムコ', were bombed by 10 military drones.
This is the immediate aftermath of the Yemeni anti-government organization "フーシ派" making a criminal statement.
"The aim of the Hush Party is to make the international community aware that if Iran continues to impose an oil embargo on Iran, it will be painful to pay for it". (International political analyst 原出氏)
Following the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's oil production was halted, and crude oil prices surged 15%.
This way, there are rumors that the oil shock will come again.
"Trump has publicly pledged to withdraw US troops from the Middle East, and he wants to avoid any military intervention at all costs, at least until after the elections next year. It is clear that Iran will continue to conduct drone strikes in the shadows of the Houthi faction. But the US cannot tolerate it for long. There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran in the future".
The "proxy war" between the United States and Iran is facing a crisis of immediate outbreak.

A YouTuber who is now a hugely popular YouTuber, focusing on youth.
It is now not uncommon for companies to use YouTubers to advertise their own products, but there are companies that have started a rare mechanism called "YouTuber hiring" to hire full-time employees in their own companies.
企業のCRM((顧客関係管理) を主要事業とする株式会社ダイレクトマーケティングミックス(以下、DmMiX)だ。
What does "adopting a YouTuber" really mean?
I heard from Mr.小林祐樹, who is the DmMiX representative director, who is also the representative of the first sub-company hired by the actual YouTuber, who is also the director of the DmMiX representative director, who is currently employed by the sub-company hired by the actual YouTuber.
We want to support young YouTubers who are struggling to get hired.
― What does "YouTuber hiring" actually mean?
小林祐樹 ((以下、小林 ) : 今やYouTuber is a profession that has become the dream of many young people。
The ranking of the future occupations that the 小学生 want to be in is also at the top, and more and more young people will be looking for it in the future. 
From now on, our company has been recruiting and supporting young people who are pursuing their dreams, such as bandman, or funny-artists.
Similarly, hiring young people who are pursuing their dreams of becoming a YouTuber is "YouTuber hiring".
― ― ― There is an image that YouTuber is a person who posts videos on his own, but ― Why did you consider "adopting" him?
小林: While many young people dream of a career as a YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers don't make the money they want.
There are many creators who are making and posting videos while working, or who are not accepted by their families as YouTubers.
In this initiative, we will provide hired creators with a salary and an environment for content production.
However, we are in a precarious position at first, and we want to support the career of YouTuber by supporting our company.

"I want Korea to return to the GSOMIA" The US office of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (YPG) - Yahoo!
He said on November 27 that "we hope that Korea will reconsider its decision to abandon the GSOMIA protection agreement" regarding the expiring Japan's military information including protection agreement (GSOMIA) on November 23.
It is not unusual for a high-ranking official to mention the GSOMIA re-examination of the destruction of the GSOMIA.
GSOMIA is based on the basis of which the respective days of the day, days, days, days, days, days, and years of the year are mutually concluded, and the missile launch information is shared.
If Korea announces in August that it will break the agreement with Japan, the framework for protecting military information in Japan will collapse if it is not implemented.
Nappar argued that "without GSOMIA, we cannot effectively respond to the crisis".
"There is a time until the expiration of the expiration of the expiration period" and strongly urged the return of Korea.
He also expressed threat recognition of the contractual flight training conducted by the USA in July in Japan's airspace, calling it "the first in history", and appealed that "it is essential that the US and Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, should be united in alliance".
昨今の日韓関係悪化は"米国国益を傷つける" he said.
"There is no intention of仲介" and "Japan will play a leading role in filling the gap".

Yurgen Klop, who won the Best Director award for "The Best", has looked back on his career in an interview and commented on the current situation.
Among the many statements, the one that surprised the world was the one about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who is his biggest rival in the Premier League title fight.
Neイマール's best friend Aubes says:" "His happiness is still in the future"...
After the award ceremony for 'The Best', the German commander-in-chief said: "I could not have imagined anything so wonderful. I am very satisfied and proud to have received this award. It was a great few days for me. I won because of my players. The most important thing is the team".
"I respect him very much", said Kropp about Gordiola, "What can I say about him? He has won many titles. His team's style of play is extraordinary. He is the best manager I have ever faced, and it is an honor to be nominated and to compete for the award with him".

Klopp is not lost on the best moments of 2019 without commenting: " (CL) Barcelona was a setback. many experts and myself would not have bet a cent against us. . . . in a 3-0 win against a team with Messi and Sures . . . it's like a death sentence. . . we had a small chance and we could have made it. . . . we couldn't believe it. . . . looking back we might have won CL in this match. . . . this match will be remembered by everyone".
Kropp, who was finally asked a personal question, said: "When I was celebrating the Bundesliga victory, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. This time it didn't happen. I'm a person who is plagued by the compulsive idea of self-management, so I don't like to get drunk. The CL victory celebration was very restrained. I remember everything. If I put everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone I saw from the bus".

This is a feature that treats the iPad as a subdisplay for the Mac, which was traditionally implemented in third-party apps.
And Sidecar is expected to be better in completeness because it is Apple's pure function.
There are also rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first we want to experience this next generation of macOS in a store.

I don't think that just "official price cuts" will promote healthy competition in the marketplace.
The enterprise should develop customer-base competition before being shut out by the government.

We have taken exceptional measures to curb the inflationary cost of healthcare due to ageing, and to encourage the reorganization and integration of hospitals in competing regions.
In October, the hospital will also be asked to reorganize the hospital and to consider the nature of the merger, and I hope to reach a conclusion by September next year.
There is no force of force, but local chiefs and residents are expected to revolt over the fear of the nearby hospital being lost.

The Ministry of Labour and Employment has conducted a survey of 1,455 public and public hospitals, which can respond to "highly urgent period" for severe patients, and "acute period" for general surgery, based on 2017 data.
The clinical record of 9 items, such as cancer, ambulance and ambulance medicine, was analyzed, whether the competing hospital is located "within 20 minutes by car" and whether the need for hospital name disclosure was assessed.
The targeted hospitals should consider the possibility of dismantling or transferring some clinical departments to other hospitals.
The medical expenses will increase sharply in the 25 years when all the members of the entire generation are over 75 years old.
Therefore, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has set a target of reducing the number of hospital beds in the country to 1.246.000 in 18 years to 1.191.000 beds.
Currently, while there are many "highly urgent" and "emergency" beds, which are expensive for the nurses, there is not enough high-level care for the elderly.
In order to cope with the aging population, not only must the number of beds be reduced, but also the number of beds must be increased.
In order to reorganize hospitals and integrate them, each Tōhō-ku prefecture will set a "regional medical concept" that will determine the number of beds needed in 25 years.
The whole country is divided into 339 regions, which are discussed by the local authorities and health officials, but many local residents and chiefs maintain a cautious attitude.
The 厚労省 wants to activate the debate by publishing the names of poorly performing hospitals.

豚コレラワクチン推奨地域9県 農水省 (((岐新聞Web ) - Yahoo!ニュース (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYYYYYYY)
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has published a draft amendment to the anti-epidemic guidelines that makes it possible to vaccinate currently unauthorized pigs for the prevention of the spread of the infection with the livestock infectious disease "豚 (((とん) cholera".
対象地域は、豚や野生イノシシで感染が確認されている岐、愛知県など9県を選択する方針。
Movement of vaccinated live pigs and eggs, etc., is restricted within the territory, but the circulation of meat and processed products outside the territory is allowed.
Through the public opinion polls, etc., we aim to complete the procedure in October as soon as possible.
By allowing the use of vaccines, such as raw meat, to be exported to the region, it could affect the export of pig meat, instead of the "clean country" that was recognized by the international organization.
Since the incident in September last year, Japan has been in a temporary state of preservation of its status as a clean country.

グレタ・トゥーンべリさん "Why do adults make children laugh and threaten them?" is a question that was raised on Twitter ≫
Грета・トゥーンベリさん, a Swedish environmental activist who made a speech on 23 September at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, is
While the speech is being noticed, there are also messages that insulted Ms. Greeta.
Twitter集グレタ・トゥーンべリさん"Why do adults laugh at children and threaten them?"
Political commentators have said that she is "mentally ill; being exploited by her parents and the international left wing" on a US TV show, and that the TV station used her has apologized.
In Japan, there are also many online messages about "greeta being used and cute, cute, and you should go to school" and other things, and commenting on the non-essential parts of what she said.
Meanwhile, on September 26, Greeta tweeted, "Why do adults spend so much time teasing and bullying teenagers and children?"
"I can only think of lies and conspiracies".
Greeta began posting, "They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting again.They're starting to start again.They're starting to come up with the same kind of activity.They're chasing after my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from other people.They're coming up with the same kind of lies and conspiracy theories that they can think of".
And, pointing out that adults seem to be turning the argument around because they don't want to face the climate and environmental crisis, he continued:
Why adults spend their time laughing and threatening teenagers and children, honestly, I don't understand.
You can do better at another time then.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But, you must not waste your time in paying attention to them anymore.
The world is starting to wake up.
Change is coming。
Whether or not adults like the change.
See you on the road!
On Friday the 20th of the previous week, there were strikes against climate change in New York and around the world.

What are the best ways to prevent dementia and keep it at a "good" level?
取材・文/渡辺陽 (((わたなべ・よう)  (which is also known as 渡辺陽)
The biggest pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals are frustrating the challenge of research and development with the dementia drug.
However, he said, the relationship between dementia and lifestyle habits is being clarified, and it has been found that it is possible that it can be extremely mild, and that it can be kept to a certain degree in oblivion.
I heard about the recent events at the nearby 近大学病院 脳卒中センター 大俊輔教授.
認知症はなくならない is the most common form of dementia.
― ―  dementia prevención, or treatment of dementia is awaited, but what is the situation
大 軽症から重症まで、程度差こそあれ、誰もが年をとるにつれて認知症になる可能性があります。
However, it is still expected to take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.
Donnepezil, a drug commonly used in Japan, is also already out of the insurance market in some overseas countries, and no significant treatment effects can be expected.
On the other hand, while the decrease in deaths from infectious diseases and accidents, cancer deaths and cancer drugs, etc., has been decreasing due to the remarkable progress in treatment, people are now able to live longer.
Therefore, it is also true that the number of dementia patients is increasing.
We must not solve problems that can be solved by individuals or families alone, but rather by the society as a whole, creating an environment where people can live in peace and security in the region.
How to keep the "forgetfulness" level low
― ―  Are there people who are prone to dementia、
Although the development of dementia is inevitable, it is possible to reduce the symptoms as much as possible and keep them to a "degenerate level".
痴呆症 is thought of as one of the lifestyle diseases and tends to affect people who are prone to it.
まず、メタボの人は、 are more prone to dementia。
Dementia is considered one of the lifestyle diseases.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and blood disorders.
Economic power is affected by absence of economic power.
For example, in the United States, there are areas that distribute food stamps to the poor, such as food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, food stamps, etc.
It can be used by people who cannot use ガスも電気も、そもそも料理ができない環境で生活している人が利用します。
Then, we become a diet low in vegetables and proteins, and we lead a life of fat and sugar.
Eventually, poor but obese, and when it comes to doing things, you can't watch TV anymore, and your body becomes unfree.
△ Similar situations can occur in Japan.
People who do not think things or do things are also more prone to dementia.
That is, to prevent dementia, you must read books and think about things from day one.
