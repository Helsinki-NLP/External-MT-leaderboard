And Wales worries that they'll look like heroes
Some MPs are concerned about a suggestion to change their English titles to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Welsh Senedd in Welsh).
This is due to plans to change the name of the assembly to Senedd Wales.
ACs across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be a source of corruption.
Labour's AC said its group was concerned that the title was contradictory to the words "Twp and Pwp".
And to anyone who understands Welsh: You don't want to be called that.
AC from Blaid Cymru said the group as a whole was unhappy with the suggestion that they had proposed other options.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was keeping an open mind about the name change, but suggested there was not much difference verbally between MWP and Muppet.
The ASC Welsh translation is not so much trouble.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptions of Assembly Members' titles will be a matter for the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals.
As for the title of Assembly Members, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (WMP), but MWP emerged stronger in the public consultation.
The Commission is reportedly suggesting other options, but the work of reaching a consensus could lead to a headache for the President, Elin Jones.
The legislation on the amendments will include other changes to the way the scheme works, including rules on the disqualification of ACs and the design of the committee system.
The Councils will have the final vote on what should be called for when they discuss the legislation.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, a neighboring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory.
Gjorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, opposes the country's vote on the name change and has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favour of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that a name change is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's ear grows as churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, there was a bar and a church on every corner, according to the old people I spoke to", said Mr. Adams.
Today, one of them is.
He said it was understandable why the bars had disappeared.
People socialize differently today, he says.
Bars are no longer considered community living rooms where people go regularly.
As for the churches, they are worried that the money raised from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect it to, and sooner or later they will be back to the same old situation.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by flats with condominiums full of the kind of people who would not help the rest of the area's shrines.
The vast majority of people who want to buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, he said, which will mean that all these churches will close earlier because most of these people who want to move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of the churches.
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had been worshiping nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's church was turned over to a black congregation under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the vendors on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, who refused to hire or hire black people.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but as Father Johnson's forces made plans for reconstruction, the bells were commissioned.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor at St Martin's, was proud to name them the "Poor People's Clocks".
The expert who played the bells in July gave them another name: Cultural Treasure and Unique Historical Instrument.
Also, the expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, noted that these were the first bells in the world to be sung by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to singing the larger bells at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin's church had no one in its place.
What has happened at St Martin's over the past few months has been a complex history of contractors and contractors, some of whom have been employed by the church's lay leaders, and others by the Episcopal diocese.
The vestry - the governing body of the parish which includes lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July to raise concerns that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs to the vestry, although the vestry had not been involved in the employment of the engineers and contractors the diocese had sent there.
Some mobs complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishopric.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy as he dives for shark fins in California
According to officials, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while swimming for shrimp in California, on the first day of shrimp season.
The attack occurred just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been swimming with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that he thought he was excited at first when he caught hold of the boy's handkerchief. But when he reached the boy, Hammel told him that he realized he was screaming, "I've been cheated!"
I've been cheated!
His shoulder bridge was torn open.
And I cried out to all the people, and they came up out of the water; and Hammal said, There is a shark in the water.
The boy was pulled from the water in a crane and transported to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is currently in critical condition.
We don't know what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
In a press briefing, lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles said the victim had sustained injuries to the upper body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and investigative purposes.
Giles said there were more than 135 shark species in the area but most of them are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's plans to reach the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by offering beauty salons in the form of boutiques that feature specialist assistants.
As part of the effort to reach the UK beauty market, a £2.8bn market that continues to grow despite falling sales of fashion and home goods, these larger-scale beauty kits will be trialled in 11 stores across the country.
This investment in the beauty world comes as supermarkets look for ways to use empty shelves after being chased for TV sets, microphones and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its range of beauty goods to offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezeman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Goods from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space and the branded areas will be similar to those you would see in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique fashion collection so that most products are suitable for beginners - something that is increasingly in demand among young shoppers.
In addition, the perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will be testing concessions at two Sainsbury's stores.
The fact that people are shopping online and moving towards buying a little food every day at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would look more like department stores as the supermarket chain tried to compete with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat outlets since it bought the two chains two years ago.It says this has strengthened food sales and made procurement more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-vamp its beauty and fervour areas failed.
Sainsbury's offered a joint venture with Boots in the early years of this century, but the partnership ended following a dispute over how to share the revenue of the pharmacy's supermarket stores.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury's, three years ago, selling its pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
He said Lloyds would be part of the scheme as it would add an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We have completely changed the look and feel of our beauty lines to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialised trained staff who will be there to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an essential beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is a little bit of a jerk after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, was upset that TV presenter Holly Willoughby had pulled out of an £11 million deal with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for Truly, their brand of home accessories and goods.
The couple's business has been compared to Paltrow's Virgin Shop brand.
Willoughby, one of the presenters of This Morning, had posted a message on Instagram announcing her departure.
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is upset that Holly Willoughby pulled out of her profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on her own big new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "in a coma" on Tuesday when the presenter admitted in a meeting at her business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time for Truly, their brand of home accessories and goods.
The business was compared to the Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune, which was estimated at £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones traveled from Britain to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was one of Holly's top priorities.
This was her long-term future and the work she would have done over the next decades.
Everyone was surprised to hear that she had decided to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, and it was so close to launch.
The warehouse is full of goods at the headquarters in Marlow, and those are ready to be sold.
Experts believe this decision by one of Britain's most bankable stars could cost the company millions of euros due to a large investment in products, including candies, candles, clothing and household goods.
Perhaps this will be the end of a long friendship too.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been good friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples go on vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Yesterday, a source close to Jones said, "We will not comment on his business affairs".
It was a tough course and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism that the news media would receive for making what some would consider "unpresidential" remarks and being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said by four news anchors.
I didn't give up anything.
Kim said he was keen to have a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, a meeting Trump described as a major step forward in North Korea's denuclearization.
However, discussions on decentralisation have slowed.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, one of North Korea's top diplomats, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not believe the US is responding in line with North Korea's early denuclearization moves.
Instead, he said the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his big speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results - stopping rocket tests, helping to free missiles and ensuring that the rest of the American troops returned home.
He went on to justify his unusual behavior in speaking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Destroy Island, After Hundreds of Years
Following the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, something that is necessary to catalyze international aid.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is quite challenging, Ms Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is forming a team to travel to Palu, they are still unsure if foreign staff can work on the land.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would provide assistance.
Because the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country is not yet sufficiently prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not common on other coastlines.
It appears that no tsunami warning was received in Palu, although a warning was issued, which contributed to the death toll.
Travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is difficult at best.
Natural disasters mean that the logistics are even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was hanging in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's racist infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But a lack of funds has been a thorn in Mr. Joko's side as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko also faces pressure from long-standing nominal detentions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other brutal weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool, scoring an equaliser against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge prevented Liverpool from losing a Premier League game to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri and he scored almost 30 times in a 1-0 loss to Chelsea.
The ball kicked to his left before shooting towards the left post.
The ball rose high above the box as it moved towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball finally landed on Kepa Arrizabalaga as he jumped and the ball landed in the net.
"I was trying to get to that position and get hold of the ball and players like Shaq always play when they can, so I was trying to create as much time as possible for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming and I kicked the ball without thinking too much about it, just went for it.
At half-time, Chelsea won 1-0 after Eden Hazard, the star of Belgium, scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea striker passed the ball with his shoe back to Mateo Kovacic this time, before turning away near the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic gave up a quick pass and went into the middle of the field.
Then, the ball skillfully passed between the defenders of the other team, leading Hazard into the box.
Hazard was the fastest defender to finish in the top of the post with a left-footed pass to Liverpool player Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play Napoli in a Premier League group game at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The total death toll from Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday morning.
Many people were reportedly trapped in the middle of a rubble of buildings that collapsed when the 7.5-magnitude quake struck on Friday, triggering waves as high as 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Paulo, which has a population of over 380,000, was covered with rubble and collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Mhenbedw, Glannau Dry, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed on Grayson Mews on John Street at 7.55am and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to report if they heard or saw anything.
Detective Inspector Brian OHagan said: Although the investigation is only just beginning, I would ask anyone who has been in the John Street area of Manchester to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
Also, if anyone, especially taxi drivers, has caught anything on the touch-screen cameras, they should contact us in case they have information that is critical to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from the Penobscot area and that her body was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are notifying the victim's next of kin.
A drunk taxi driver living in Grayson Mews is trying to get back to his apartment but police have told him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He had no words when he heard it happen.
Residents are now being told they will have to wait a few hours before being allowed back in.
One police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area was now being treated as a crime scene.
The lady reached the site in tears.
She keeps saying this is so awful.
At 2pm there were two police stations in the cordon and another one outside it.
A number of officers were standing in the cordon monitoring the block of flats.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 with a record of 247 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell outside the Parliament is the latest reminder to be part of the battle to rewrite history
Removing the statue would be poetic justice for the terrible destruction of so many of England's cultural and religious artifacts, done by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society said that Mr Crick's suggestion was a "guerrilla" that "attempted to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable, in the current debate over statues being removed, that the figure of Oliver Cromell outside St Stephen's Palace would be targeted.
Cromwell was not responsible for the execution or ordering of the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
The wrong Lord Cromwell might have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The outstanding portrait of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft of Cromwell is a testament to 19th century judgment and is part of the history of a figure many people believe is still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, more in the 19th century than today, consider Cromwell to be a figure who defended parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
We don't know if that's absolutely true or not and that's an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our country thereafter and Cromwell is a single well-known figure who represents one side of the argument.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
A Riding Pig Kills a Farmer in China
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that a man, identified by his nickname Yuan, was found dead by pig's dung in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had reportedly travelled with his band from the neighbouring province of Tunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning. his mistress found him dead and remarked that a door of a nearby pigsty was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the trunk and that there was blood on his mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig had torn the farmer to death, the report said.
"My legs were torn and all bloody", said the hero, who was nicknamed Wu, as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan arriving at the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pig.
Her body was found about an hour later.
Yuan and his family were not the same animal that killed the man.
One of the market managers told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were gathering evidence at the site.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly discussing compensation for his death.
Although there are not many, there are other records of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years later, a 650-pound pig grappled a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife scared the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can cause them to behave so.
They were curious.
They're young, very curious... they don't mean you any harm.
You must show them proper respect.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall over a large area of the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over colder waters off the west coast of Mexico.
However, Storm Rosa will cause heavy rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, Category 1 winds as of 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, the storm will begin to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will carry up to 10 inches of hand to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Tropical moisture will then react with the approaching snowfall causing heavy rain over the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous large floods, rubble flooding and possible desert landslides.
Deep tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates of 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southeast, especially over much of Arizona.
Large floods are possible with conditions rapidly worsening due to the scattered nature of the tropical rain.
It would be very dangerous to venture out into the desert on foot with the threat of a thunderstorm.
Heavy rain could turn the dunes into wild rivers and a storm of hail and hail will cause strong winds and dust storms in the area.
The approaching storm will cause some heavy local thunderstorms in parts of the Southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch of hand may fall, which could cause a small flow of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first call to the area during its wet season.
A few scattered tropical storms will begin to arrive in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before spreading more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
Temperatures will change dramatically across the US during October as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature over short distances.
This is a great example of dramatic temperature changes across the central US on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, what's left of summer's warmth will try to rise and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern US is expected to have a warm start to October with temperatures in the 80s from the Southern Lowlands to parts of the Northeast.
New York City temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecasts show a high chance of above-average temperatures for the eastern US throughout the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accused of sexual abuse in the 1980s, testify, on six different television networks.
Meanwhile, political disagreement continued, with broadcasters disrupting regular programming to air the unexpected turn of events on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake stated that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had improperly touched her and tried to strip her at a party at the high school, and that he was drunk.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was absolutely certain that did not happen.
It was likely to be watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company averaged audience numbers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not available directly for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has some trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To give perspective, this crowd was similar in size to an audience that would watch a football game or the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel opinion guests strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leading all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the hearing, which lasted throughout the day.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, NSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
There was much interest following the hearing as well.
Flake was the most visible figure in the Friday play.
After moderate Republican officials declared that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning with protesters yelling at him as he tried to enter an elevator for a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood staring at the floor for a few minutes as he got his head blown off, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
And it was said to him, Thou hast power, and many women have no power.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator closed, he would have more to say after the committee hearing.
All the cable and broadcast networks were filming live hours later, when it was time for the Judiciary Committee to vote to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination and get a vote in the full Senedd.
But Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nomination by the following week, an outcome that minority Democrats have been urging.
Flake was partially convinced after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Following discussions with Coons and many other MPs afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was a powerful one, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK MP May accuses critics of playing politics in Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest.
Theresa May, British Prime Minister, arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, 29 September 2018.
In another interview on the sidelines of her front-page interview, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, was criticizing what she called the Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a "ridiculous" proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other.
Police arrest Dyton Simpson on suspicion of killing one of LSU's players
Police have arrested a man on suspicion of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and will go to jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials have released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say that Sims lost his glasses during the incident.
Police found the glass at the site and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS receives WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
He has a $350,000 fund, the Attorney General said.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and throat.
The department commends the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU athletic director, thanked the area's law enforcement team for their integrity and work to ensure justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six-inch forward was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was heartbroken and horrified to hear of Wayde's death.
This is the kind of thing you worry about all the time.
A volcano deposits ash over Mexico City
Dust from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to go near the volcano after it increased activity in the crater and recorded 183 gas and ash discharges over 24 hours.
The centre monitored a number of accidents and abuses.
Images on social media showed thin layers of mud covering car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano, 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is called Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of one year of independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after two pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-terror police and as thousands joined competing protests to mark a year since Catalonia's divided vote on secession.
A group of pro-democracy protesters broke up the riot police's blockade with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Clashes also took place later in the day, with the police using their batons to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted Don't forget, don't forgive and unity protesters chanted Long live Spain.
14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained in the protests, according to local press.
Tensions remain high in this region which is currently on the brink of independence, and that was a year after the 1 October referendum which Madrid considered illegal but which was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The vast majority of voters chose to become independent, but not many people came to vote and those who were against secession significantly boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to disrupt voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration by the national police.
The rebellion continued but he was forced to follow another course.
According to Narcis Termes, the 68-year-old electrician who went to the separatist protest with his wife, he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had one of the best times ever.
I watched my parents cry for joy when they could vote but we are back in the same old situation now", she said.
Despite winning a small but crucial victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence groups have struggled to keep up the momentum going this year and many of their most prominent leaders have either exiled themselves or are awaiting trial for helping to organise the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
According to Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone in support of the police, politicians on both sides had been stirring up the waters during the clash.
The feeling of ill will is growing", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would stand in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the re-entry into democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car was driven multiple times into a house in Londonderry.
This happened in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage had been done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may have been shot at the car at some point as well.
Menga's throw ensures a 1-0 win for Livingston against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures a win for Livingston
Livingston stunned Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose for a second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's throw was the difference as Gary Holt's team rose to Hibernian level in an instant.
Gerrard's side have not won a Premier League home game this season and they face Hearts next Saturday, who are at the top and eight points ahead.
Before that, the Rangers will host a game against Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has hit six consecutive games in the minors, and head coach Holt hasn't missed a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is losing chances against the visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored and their direct nature caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but his effort dragged across the surface of the goal, then Alan Lithgow could not but aim his effort wide after slipping to meet Craig Halkett's pen across the goal,
The home team was willing to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the others in certain areas.
And that's how the all-important goal was scored.
The Rangers surrendered a free kick and Livingston worked to secure an opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to help Menga, who kicked the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had controlled possession of the ball but could not break through the home team's defenders and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not too concerned.
This pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a save from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, who kicked the ball wide from another set of play by Livingston.
Crosses were constantly coming to Livingston's foul and continued to be cleared, and two penalty kicks - after Halkett challenged player substitute Glenn Middleton and one for a handball - were dismissed.
Absolutely stunning performance by Livingston -
Alasdair Lamont, one of the BBC Scotland commentators at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A stunning performance and result for Livingston.
They were great and they continue to raise expectations on this fast climb.
Their playing style and personnel have not changed much since their arrival at the top, but Holt must be commended for the way he has motivated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant, putting together a highly organised defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the game.
But the Rangers didn't have much inspiration.
Although they had played well at times under Gerrard, those standards were not to be seen.
They had a lot of trouble with their last ball - they only opened the side once at home - and it was quite a warning to the Rangers, who are now in the middle of the table.
Mixed greetings to Erdogan in Cologne
It was a beautiful, smiling day on Saturday (May 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany to try to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
After that, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police had given security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but enough supporters had come to the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  many of them Kurds  made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them into the country.
These coronation protests reflect the deep tension surrounding the visitor, a man who is considered a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Motorcycle crash in Deptford: Biker dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and paramedics arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The accident came a few months after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his next of kin.
Road closure arrangements and directions have been put in place and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a brawl
Six officers have been injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Service.
The attack took place at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and the case is ongoing.
Specialist Tornado officers have been called in to deal with the attack, which involves eight prisoners and occurs in one wing only.
The minor injuries the officers had on their faces were treated at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesman said: Prison staff with specialist training have been on hand to deal with this ongoing incident at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can spend more time in prison.
Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison houses more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had been treated in hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, riot police officers were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot where staff were attacked with a ball of wax.
Hurricane Rosa at the Risk of Major Flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week as the remainder of Hurricane Rosa travels across the Southwest Desert, causing a risk of major flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced that it will be keeping an eye out for major flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to follow a direct path over Phoenix on Tuesday, turning up late Monday night.
In a tweet, the National Weather Service in Phoenix said that only 12 tropical cyclones have maintained storm or low-pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest models of the National Center on Aging predict between 2 and 4 inches of hand, with a few rare examples totaling up to 6 inches on the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas in the Desert Southwest including the Great Basin and the central Rockies are likely to have between 1 and 2 inches, with some cases totaling up to 4 inches possible.
For those who are not at risk of major flooding, the Rosa rain can be beneficial because they live in a dry area.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial as dry conditions are currently in the South West.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the highest category but one, weather.com said.
At first, Rosa's trail will lead to land along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico.
Rosa, which was still as strong as Sunday morning's gale with 85 mph winds, is 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm reaches the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean so it weakens.
Due to this, the storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or night.
The rain could be heavy over parts of Mexico, causing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 10 inches, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure storm, then travel up through Arizona and southern Utah arriving late Tuesday night.
The main danger that Rosa or remnants of the storm could pose is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern U.S. Desert, the National Center for Tropical Storms said.
These rains are expected to cause severe flooding that could endanger life as well as desert mudflows and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
The officers have asked anyone with material on their mobile phone about what happened to provide that evidence.
Trump says Kavanaugh has suffered from Democratic Party hatred and anger
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the hatred and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and was moved to deny Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually abused her decades ago, when they were both in their teens.
Ford testified at the hearing about his claim as well.
The President said on Saturday that the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance and standard and courage that day.
The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal practitioners of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service, he told a crowd of supporters in Northern Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of the Republican convention in the midterm elections.
It's five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
I'm not applying, but I'm applying really", he said.
That's why I go everywhere trying to fight for great candidates.
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is "Resist and obstruct".
The first key functional vote on the Senedd floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the number rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them washed away as huge waves washed up on beaches, after a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
On Friday night, hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach in the town of Paul, when waves as high as twenty feet hit the beach, sweeping away many of them and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami warning was issued yesterday, people were carrying out their activities on the beach, they did not run away from there immediately and became victims, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami was not alone, it was dragging cars, bonfires, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at a speed of 800 knots (497 mya) before hitting the beach.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were moved to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops damaged, bridges collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
After-storms still rocked the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
In a statement, the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, steep bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Bodies of some victims trapped under collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the damage and number of people injured could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggata, which is closer to the epicentre of the earthquake.
It was impossible to contact Donggala for information, Nugroho said.
More than 300,00 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
This is already a disaster, but it could get worse, he said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film shared on social media, a man can be heard on a high floor shouting at people in the street below warning them that a tsunami is on the way.
Within minutes a wall of water hit the island, carrying away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to directly authenticate the film.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major electrical fault that shut down communications around Palu making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but those who have been forced to flee their homes are in dire need of food and other essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the rescue centres in Palu on Sunday.
Over 800 have died due to the Indonesian tsunami.
It is a dreadful place.
Although World Vision staff from Donggala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers are sheltered in tarpaulin shelters set up in their office yard, they have passed some disturbing scenes on the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", she said.
Things are very bad.
Even as support groups embark on the ruthless process of providing emergency aid, some have complained that specialist foreign aid workers have been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, no funding, supplies or staff can be provided unless the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
After the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can get international help, but there's no status yet.
As night fell in Palu for the second time following the earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing were hoping that their loved ones were alive by some miracle, which would alleviate some of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was taken from the jail.
On Sunday, rescuers managed to free a woman who had been held captive for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the top paragliders for the Asian Games, held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that his students were among the others who were stranded in Roa Roa hotels.
As someone with paragliding experience, I have my own emotional capacity, he says.
In the hours after the paragliding community heard the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had been demolished, Mr Gendon said he had sent a host of WhatsApp messages to the Palu competitors who were taking part in the beach festival.
But only one green tick was next to his messages, rather than two blue ticks.
I think that means the messages have not been sent, he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 as an ATM machine is refilled in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling an ATM machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been hacking an ATM machine in the entertainment complex, preparing to provide more cash, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran after Brink's servant and stole a bag of money that was to be provided.
Witnesses saw many other people fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many were involved.
Anyone with information about the identities of these people should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name from  to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The same person who will be formally identified as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been called Ye since and used the name as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
She's going on the show in place of Ariana Grande, the American singer who withdrew for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
In addition to being a student of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year while discussing the title of his album with Big Boy, who is presenting on the radio.
So you, we, we are this.
The name Kanye, meaning the only one, went from just "Ye" to just "Ye", reflecting the good, the bad and the confused, everything.
The album does more than reflect who we are.
He is among several other famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs has had various nicknames such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who used to work with West, has also been using his name as a variation on the ending and the main characters.
AMLO in Mexico pledges not to use troops against civilians
Mexico's incoming President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use soldiers against civilians as the country marks 50 years since the bloody vengeance against students.
On Sunday in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed "never to use the military to defeat the Mexican people".
Soldiers fired on the plaza during a peaceful protest on 2 October 1968, killing as many as 300 people, and this was when left-wing student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving scholarships to those who want to study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities meant that young people were being drawn to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its budget for AI
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the money it spends on research in the field, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made announcements about artificial intelligence, although the US generally does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced its plan last year, which is to be the best country in terms of all innovation by 2030.
Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, considering that all other countries are much less developed than the US, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI, Lee said.
Doubling funding could mean doubling the chance of making sure the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence is achieved in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee has published his book "Al Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that was named the best Othello player in America.
Lee recognized previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the next viewers.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"China is not stealing the academic leaders; it is the corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recently tried to recruit bright college alumni to work on artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to migration policy could help the US strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
I believe green cards should be automatically offered to people with expertise in artificial intelligence, he said.
The State Council of China published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding for people in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding for researchers from the USA, but the standard of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced that a National Committee on Artificial Intelligence was being formed.
And this month DARPA announced an investment in a venture called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not been operational for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had prevented Macedonia from becoming a member of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right to its territory and has prevented the country from becoming part of NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will meet the 50 percent target needed to validate the referendum.
The referendum question is: Are you in favour of becoming a member of NATO and the EU and accepting the agreement with Greece?
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this price is worth paying for Macedonia, one of the only developing countries after the fall of Yugoslavia, to gain access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I have come here today to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because that ensures safer lives for all of us, said Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although they are not legally bound, enough members of parliament have said they will wait for the outcome of the vote to make it a final vote.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in the senate.
The provincial election commission said there was no report of any irregularities as of 1pm.
However, only 16 per cent voted, compared to the last parliamentary election in 2016 where 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
I have come to vote for my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name to Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018, a change that would allow the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and setting up chairs in front of a tent set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join by holding our heads high, not through the door of the servants said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will provide much-needed investment for Macedonia, a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
I think there will be a large majority because more than 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", said Zaev after casting his vote.
He said that the result of Yes would strengthen our future.
According to a poll set up last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - significantly below the required number.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV Macedonia, found that 57 percent of respondents intended to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be successful, the number of voters must be 50 percent and one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, passes all the Brighton defenders and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling break down Brighton defenders during a 2-0 Manchester City win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look terribly easy as he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker got a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders, before reaching the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green bears.
One defender shot away before running faster than many others on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then passed a left-handed pass, passing the ball to Sterling.
The England forward used his first kick in the box to put the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to hit Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-sided shot.
Aguero has some foot problems, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We had discussed that it would be 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time.
But Sterling gave Chelsea the first advantage in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in Brighton's penalty area that time.
He gave a nice kick through the players on the back court to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times before leading Sterling to the next post.
The Chelsea forward kicked the ball into the net before slipping over the boundaries.
Manchester City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer about playing against the Rockies
Since the Nationals have no hope of competing in the second chance games, there is little reason to force another starter.
But Scherzer hopes to stand on the court on Sunday to face the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are second-round game implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured at least a second chance with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still hope to secure their spot in the first group.
Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can hit the rubber knowing that there's going to be a good atmosphere here with the crowd in Denver and that the other team will play at the highest level we're going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in a game like that?
The Nationals have not announced a starter for Sunday yet, but they're reportedly willing to let Scherzer pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was to start for the 34th time, had a practice session on Thursday and would shoot on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings for Washington this season.
Trump rallies in Northern Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, and spoke of the importance of the Republican assembly in the midterm elections.
Everything we have done will be finished in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones. I'm not a candidate but I'm a real candidate, that's why I travel everywhere fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group here, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to take back the power by any means necessary, you see the hostility, the malaise.
They don't care who gets hurt, who they have to step on to get power and control, they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are trying to resist and stop.
And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "ugly and hateful and unpleasant and lying".
He referred to the name of senior Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and a loud roar was heard among the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you share the document?
Y, y, what.
No, no, wait a minute - that was an example of bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad party.
The party does not tolerate those who say what they say.
When Momentum activists in my local county voted to persecute me, it was a big surprise.
After all, I am the latest of many Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome - and that is to say we have something to say.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, has been treated in a similar way for her strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the proposal of a Conservative was to make me angry about disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
He disagreed with him on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we wanted the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
During most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been such meetings.
Unfortunately, that is not the mood in most meetings today and we have long forgotten the promise of "more kind, more tender" politics, if ever there was one.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that all views are judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the leadership.
This started soon after Jeremy became leader.Co-workers who I used to think were of the same political views as me were starting to expect me to make a bold turn and support positions I would never have agreed with otherwise - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public - and it doesn't matter what I actually say - it will lead to harsh attacks on social media calling for my non-voting, condemning centre-left politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one who's experienced this.
Indeed, I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at us tend to be political.
I admire the professional and determined nature of those colleagues who face a lot of sexual or racial abuse every day but do not let it get the better of them.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is the way in which levels of abuse have been normalised.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are not as broad-minded now and with every attempt at a vote of confidence or a change in the election rules, the party gets narrower.
I've had a lot of advice over the last two years encouraging me to keep my head down, not to express my opinion too much, then I'll be OK.
But that's not why I chose to be a politician.
I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, angered by the negligence of the Thatcher government, a government responsible for the messy condition of my combined school classroom.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could have misunderstood my political views and the areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the proposal on Friday, all I can say is that I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party as the country moves towards a Brexit that will be a blow to households, businesses and our public services.
But, in fact, I have no message for Momentum Nottingham, but a message for my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats from my immaturity or political opportunism will deter me from acting in the way I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is raging on top
Two late applications may have had some influence on the final result, but Ayr definitely deserved to win this Tennent League match.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team not beaten in the top ten.
In the end, their excellent defensive work, as well as their exploitation of opportunities, was responsible for keeping the home team and the coach, Peter Murchie, had every right to be proud.
We have had challenging games so far, but no one has beaten us, so I have to be satisfied", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "I must commend Ayr, they took advantage of opportunities better than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute pass, converted by Frazier Climo, secured Ayr's lead, but the yellow card given to Scotland capped Rory Hughes, released for the game by the Warriors, meant Melrose was able to take advantage of that and Jason Baggot kicked an unturned pass.
Climo ensured Ayr never more ahead with a penalty kick, before he, just before half-time, scored and crossed a single field goal to make the score 17-5 to Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's delivery, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a bit of a delay because Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured, and was carried away on a stretcher.
Then Ayr's interim captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and again Melrose paid for the extra player with an uncapped catch by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick line, MacPherson dropped the ball behind Ayr's increasing scrum.
Climo turned the request, as he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up a fox chicken from David Armstrong and sent forward Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth request.
Still game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran hopes to move into the hospitality industry after discovering he has been named a director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, as well as co-writing and acting with his comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the show's history and Kiernan is likely planning for his life after Craigland.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan hoped to be part of Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
NOT OUTSIDE THE SEA: Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen the route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters of a rigid crater in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a banner as soft as the sea.
Marine centres from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "We are the sea by right".
It is his duty to restore it.
Bolivia is surrounded and the memory of the fortress lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict lives on - as does the future of sailing the Pacific once again.
These hopes are more pronounced than they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and peace, and for good reason is optimistic about the outcome", says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian citizens will watch the ruling of the international court of justice on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim - after decades of heated talks - that Chile must negotiate an open sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic and brotherly president - who faces a contentious re-election battle next year - is heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and not much would change if the court did.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory, and has insisted that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ruling of the international court of justice comes only six months after the final arguments were heard suggests that the case was not a complex one, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean man who specializes in international law.
And instead of improving the case of Bolivia, it is possible that the last four years have made it worse.
The current Bolivian administration has failed on this issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined any goodwill Chile had left, he suggested.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court decision-making process is usually a quick process.
On Monday Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of ties with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement over cultural interests, he said.
Also, Calzadilla denied that Marales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - used the maritime issue as a political bag.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific", he added.
The verdict is an opportunity to realise that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says it won't get rid of its nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never get rid of its nuclear weapons unless the member trusts Washington first.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to stick to the commitments made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the countries.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming nuclear diplomacy that would fail to reach an agreement, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the idea that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to ending the Korean War will cause the North to surrender is nothing more than a nightmare.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the statement until Pyongyang makes significant evacuation moves first.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want to have a second summit.
But there are many doubts about whether Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons that the country most likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the latest collection of huge dresses is about to arrive on your Main Street
If you want another hat or you want to avoid the sun completely, this is the fashion for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a huge and striking range of gowns for their SS19 collection on the fashion stage, which was a hit on the fashion set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very unconventional hats have popped up on Instagram this summer and these designers' extraordinary creations have been seen on the fashion stage.
One of Valentino's striking items was a leather over-head hat decorated with a wide folded border covering the models' heads.
Other great accessories included watermelons decorated with games, magic hats and even apple trees - but these hats wouldn't warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of strange mushrooms - and that in good time for Winterfell.
Many of the colorful muscles had interlocking lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than a masterpiece.
And the likeness of the one was like a robe of pure linen, and his loins were like a coat of mail; and the likeness of the other was like a horn of wool, and it was folded.
And, if you enjoy big fashion statements - this is your chance.
Those who keep an eye on style predict that giant bonnets could reach your high street.
These large hats follow the style of La Bomba, the popular two-foot wide-brimmed green hats, which are even worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
Behind these unconventional hats seen on social media, the cult label also had another great creation on the fashion scene - a shirt bag almost as big as the model in a swimsuit she was wearing.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with a raffia edge and white leather handkerchief, was one of the most striking items in the La Riviera SS19 Jacquemus collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Renowned stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big beach hats and bags hit the high street next summer - with the designer having made such an impression, it would be difficult to avoid the demand for big accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a reputation for academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional results in the examinations, only supplemented by individual and collective success in the fields of sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, which are represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their pupils for further and higher education, for the careers of their choice and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a leading school curriculum, we see modern languages still being popular subjects of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, it will stay with them.
If anyone speaks in a tongue, he speaks in his own spirit.
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Looking at the recent test results this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the charts and include the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of pupils who studied foreign languages have achieved a high A grade.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, show that 72% of pupils achieved an A-Level in Mandarin, with 72% of those studying German, 69% of those studying French and 63% of those studying Spanish achieving an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a vital skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Languages, as subjects, are now treated in the same way as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that a lack of language skills was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employers were unable to fill vacancies.
Therefore, there is a growing demand for languages to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more proposed job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a global environment.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future of acquiring such a long-term skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people in other countries will mean that a bilingual person will be a step ahead immediately.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 73 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation.
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
Knowing a number of languages, especially the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Many schools will focus on classical modern languages, but other schools will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK as we look to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, and the schools will include teaching staff who are specialised in this field.
Scotland's independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever comes their way.
It cannot be denied that at the moment, in a global business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, variety and excellence to young people in Scotland.
I must be careful.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James start playing for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game of the series on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't decided how many minutes he'll play again.
"It's going to be more than one but less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers press secretary Mike Trudell tweeted that it was likely James would play for a few minutes.
After a practice session earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six-game schedule.
At this stage in my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare, he said.
Trump's YouTube channel
President Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including visits to friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his selection for the Supreme Court delayed, Trump is seeking to win support for the midterm elections as the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote takes place in November.
When's Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can I watch it online?
Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7 p.m. Eastern time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below using a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings on his nomination for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is under strain as a result of sexual misconduct allegations with the Senate confirmation vote delayed by up to a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans facing tough elections in November gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said the five rallies over the next week would aim to "trigger volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and add to their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so important to their agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible before the start of an important campaign term", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's rally could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage from Pittsburgh, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he gained more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican congressional candidate for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in the penny poles.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come here to try to give him a boost in the penny poles", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows the stamina to fight on as they go to singles games on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's fourth could be just what this Rugby Cup needed.
The momentum pendulum is a concept that's been imagined in the sports world but it's a concept that players believe in especially in competitions like this.
So where would they say the momentum is right now?
"They were six points ahead and now they are four, so we have some momentum to build", said Jordan Spieth as he left for the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points on the field with another eleven to play.
As Spieth said, the Americans feel they have a bit of a wind in their sails and they have enough to cheer them up, especially from Speith and Justin Thomas who played together all day and got three points out of four.
Speith has been excellent to you in the past and he leads by example.
The screams of celebration went over as the round went on, succeeding with a crucial pair to go on a game to four one though he was out and Thomas had been down two by two.
There was a similar scream after the pitch that won the game for them on the 15th, the kind of loud scream that tells you he doesn't think America is out of it yet.
You have to focus and worry about your own hair, says Speith.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed Ryder Cup story.
A couple who love Europe have four for four and can't do anything wrong.
Moliwood was the only bar to have no bag on Saturday afternoon, and they didn't have any bag on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon or the last nine on Friday morning either.
That run, and the way the energy flows between them and the crowd confirms that they are the players to beat on Sunday, the same player who would be more popular to confirm a European victory with their right to carry over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
If possible both at the same price on different sheets.
But it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson easily defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was matched by Alex Noren.
After a draw and two doubles in the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede were in a hole and came no closer to climbing out of it.
But on Sundays, no one helps you out of your hole.
There are four pillars and four players that are interesting to watch because of the relationship between the players, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
So far Europe has played better as a team and they are a little ahead at the start of the last day, but the four-legged session has proven that Team USA has the ability to fight, something that some especially in the USA doubted.
Europe leads ten to six on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe have a significant advantage on the final day of the Rugby World Cup after finishing four games behind the USA on Saturday.
The amazing duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the campaign with two victories over Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
European Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to regain the trophy after losing at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American underdogs in four matches on the morning to take the series to 3-1.
The USA offered more resistance in the quarters, but they could not overcome the deficit.
Jim Furyk's squad needs eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the lead.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, who have been nicknamed Molliwood after an incredible weekend, became the second bar to score four points from their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After Woods and Patrick Reed scored on the four balls, they worked together to beat Woods on a regular American rookie's 5 and 4.
Wood, who pulled off two games on Saturday, had some special chances but has lost 19 of 29 games in four straight balls and four and seven strokes.
Justin Rose, disqualified for the fourth ball of the morning, returned as Henrik Stenson's partner in the fourths beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka first and third in the world by 2 and 1.
Everything went wrong for Europe on a beautiful, sunny day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won three majors, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2 and 1 against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the four balls and later beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the fourth after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from four points behind at the start of the singles, although only a tie score is required on the Furyk side as they are the holders of the trophy.
But, after being second for two days, coming into their shade on Sunday looks as if it's beyond their ability.
North Korea says they won't unilaterally sign without trust
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions reinforce US prejudice and that the country would not be unilaterally disarmed under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill steps" in the past year, such as halting nuclear drills and tests, decommissioning a nuclear test site, and pledging not to spread nuclear weapons or nuclear technology.
But we do not see such a response from the US", he said.
Without trust in the US there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we cannot afford to be self-serving in the first place.
While Ri had repeated North Korean familiar complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual denuclearization response where North Korea would be rewarded by taking gradual steps, his statement was seen as significant as he did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement between Kim John-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work towards the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula while Trump promised to guarantee Korea's security.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also rejected calls for the easing of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US demands "first denuclearisation" and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and is even opposed to the declaration to end the war, RI said.
The creature that can be overwhelmed by sanctions is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions reinforce our suspicions.
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a summit the president had announced at the United Nations a week earlier.
Instead, the minister noted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five weeks and added: "If South Korea were the party to the issue of denuclearization and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not lead to such an impossible situation".
However, Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US targeting of North Korea with missiles was inevitable after "Mr. Trump's President Trump called Kim a rocket scientist on a self-determination mission".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps to de-escalate, but said there was much work to be done and that sanctions had to wait until North Korea became denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a specific time frame for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN General Assembly should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN General Assembly on Thursday: "The Security Council sanctions must be strictly and unconditionally enforced until we achieve and confirm complete denuclearisation".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to try to limit funding for Pyongyang's nuclear programs and telegrams.
Ri met Pompeo on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.#
Pyongyang left in July saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him within hours of making orders as a gangster.
North Korea has promised to meet with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and nuclear site if the US takes corresponding steps.
He said Kim had told him that the "Appropriate Measures" he was asking for were the security guarantees Trump had offered in Singapore and moves towards normalizing relations with the US.
Harvard students get a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting undergraduates to sleep more in an attempt to tackle the macho culture of studying all night on caffeine.
Academics found that students at the world's best universities often go astray when it comes to their own basics.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
She was inspired at the start of the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only learning this now, in my last year?"
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", she told the Telegraph.
The course, which will be introduced for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
In one section is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on cups of coffee, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
We are aware that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know what the impact of smoking is on your health", added Professor Chesler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a rapidly worsening problem.
Ensuring you get enough, and quality, sleep should be a way for students to cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even to avoid putting pressure on yourself, because lack of sleep makes the brain think you're fat, making you fat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler design the course, after taking one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to try to get the course for the entire campus.
It is hoped that the next step will be to require all post-secondary students to complete a similar study plan before joining the competing institution.
Professor Ceisler recommends that students consider setting an alarm for going to sleep, as well as for waking up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light released by electronic screens and LED light, which can affect your circadian rhythm leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: goal by Menga beating Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another poor home game as Dolly Menga's goal led to a 1-0 loss to unseeded Steven Gerrard at Livingstone.
Ibrox were looking for their first road win since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's Gerrard team scored for only the second time in 18 games as manager to leave the team eight points behind Ladbrokes' top-flight leaders Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers were short of spirit and no sign of being able to come to an equalization.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone rise to third just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for the Rangers after the shooter Calum Spence had to undergo treatment for a head injury after something was thrown over the visitors' head.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt remained with the 11 Hearts beat last week and would be pleased with the way his organised squad dominated their opponents at every opportunity.
Rangers may have dominated in possession but Livingstone made more of a comeback when they had her.
They should have scored after just two minutes after Menga's pass gave Scott Pittman a chance on Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder missed his chance by striking the ball clearly.
Keaghan Jacobs made a deep free kick to find captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could not hit the back post clearly.
Rangers were in control but there was more hope than faith in their play in the final corner of the game.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a kick out of the cigarette after a quarter of an hour after he and Steven Lawless fought but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers had two shots on goal in the first half but Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's penalty and Ovie Ejaria's shot.
Although Livi's goal after 34 minutes had been against the flow of the game, no one can argue that they had not merited it for their hard work alone.
Yet, the Rangers are dealing with Jacobs' deep play plans.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the bell to Scott Robinson, who was agitated as he passed it to Menga for an easy finish.
Gerrard was a brake when he replaced Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change almost had an immediate effect on the goalkeeper passing to Morelos but Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could have added to their score in the final minutes but McGregor rose well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow missed a penalty from the corner.
Rangers captain Glenn Middleton had another request for a kick from the smoking gun after a collision with Jacobs but Thomson again ignored the request.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and in DIGITAL... the day physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring gravity, a development that would eventually lead to a device called the Geiger Gauge.
An important part of science since then, the Geiger counter also became an important part of popular culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starring as highly unlikely scientists.
Man: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: Geiger measurements, they're used to find interstellar minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms that are released by the atmosphere in the minerals.
Evans: Well, it makes quite a noise!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the device named after him continues to be used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to detect and kill foreign cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, and adapting them in a laboratory
Then they'll be able to see a protein that's common in many cancers and they'll be injected again.
A trial of the vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear in over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect a protein called HER2 that is common in many cancers, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 causes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal/rheumatic cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and learning how to target cancer cells has worked to treat types of leukemia.
Following his appearance on SNL, Kanye West began a pro-Trump speech wearing a MAGA cap.
She didn't go well
Kanye West was blown into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a rousing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for President in 2020.
After performing her third performance that night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great Again cap, she rallied against the Democrats and reiterated her support of Trump.
I'll talk to a white person and they'll say, "How can you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch featuring Matt Damon where Hollywood star actor Brett Kavanaugh mocks testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, a video of West performing was uploaded to social media by accountant Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to trick West by posting it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had been bullied behind the stage for what he was wearing on his head.
They were pushing me behind the stage.
And they said, Let us go out with the hat on.
They were shooting at me!
Then they say I'm in a low place", he said, then after the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You want to see the low point?" saying that I would put my Superman hat on, because it means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments were booed at least twice by the SNL audience and cast members were uncomfortable to watch, Variety reported, with the same person telling the publication: "The studio went completely quiet".
West was added as a late addition to the Ariana Grande lineup, as his former rapper boyfriend Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West caused a stir by performing I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who said: "To one of the characters in the play: 'Sorry for the abuse of this character.'
But presenter Karen Hunter commented that West was just being himself and that was great.
But I choose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and expresses ideas that are harmful to my community.
It's free.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying his new name was "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who has also been called Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
He and rapper Snoop Dogg were named Snoop Lion and of course the late Prince's music changed his name to symbol and then to the artist previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after a drive-by shooting in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was shot dead in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The shooting took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington killed by poison ivy
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has killed off the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thought something had gone wrong and questioned how to tackle the problem of toxic husbands in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels strongly about tackling the problem.
I feel strong for a minute - what's wrong with men?, she said.
What have we been teaching men as they grow up, about the problem we have now?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic males because of the very male characters.
And he went on before him, saying, What is the sound of the wind, and what is the sound of learning?
What is it that is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes boys feel that they have to be a special kind of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
For it is obvious that something is wrong with young men.
In the interview he admitted that he would not do any more Game of Thrones episodes when the series ended next summer, saying he had had enough of battles and horses.
From November Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met a woman on the show, so in a way she gave me my family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's love interest for Kit, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
Around 40,000 new cases were identified in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most cases were sexually transmitted, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of contaminated blood supplies.
But the number of people infected with HIV has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan province.
But year on year, the number of people in China living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly rampant.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have suggested that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many of the transmission of infections is due to inadequate sexual safety in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of a plan to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked the data of Republican lawmakers, killing on "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three Republican Senators to the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the accusations were being spread by far-right Canadian pundits.
"Lies, lies, and more lies", Walters said in a statement to Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information went viral online on Thursday, after being posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was released after Kavanaugh was questioned by three lawmakers.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState announced that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released information from a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
"This baseless accusation is false and a bare lie", Waters said.
The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information, and safety have been compromised as a result of these false and misleading allegations - was not responsible in any way for the release of this information.
This groundless accusation is false and a blatant lie.
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is a pain", wrote Fleischer.
This suggests that she is not in the nature to be a Member of Congress.
When they are accused of something they have not done, they do not go away.
They can't be hereditary.
They cannot question the motive of the accused.
They must be quiet and not disturb.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"If it's true, it's a great one".
In his statement, Waters said his office had informed the appropriate authorities and the law enforcement agency of the fraudulent allegations.
We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed, he said and that they are held accountable for the activities that are harmful and dangerous to all members of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - parody of weak spy with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British theme and I find it appropriate for this revival of the Johnny English comedy-drama series - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Or self-pity tongue in cheek at how sober we will be at the nation's new export opportunity?
However, the glamorous Johnny English has been licensed to destroy everything left for a second time - with his name more than anything indicating that he is a comic character created for movie-goers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, this is the detective detective who, despite his noble claims, included a little bit of Clouseau, Mr Bean, on a man who contributed a note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Originally based on the traveller and mystery man Atkinson played in a Barclaycard commercial, leaving a trail of doom behind.
There's one or two good scenes in the latest Johnny English movie.
I loved watching Johnny English walk towards a skipper wearing a suit and the rotor blades hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is evident, but the humor is weak and oddly unnecessary, especially now that serious films like 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy as an element of their films.
The humor feels as though it is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the Johnny English's innuendo is not as clever and specific as Atkinson's quiet joke in Bean's persona.
The current idea is that Great Britain is in big trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's secret network of spies, releasing the identities of all the British spies in the field, despite the disguise of duty - an unfortunate and minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final step for a self-righteous and self-centered prime minister who is already suffering from massive political unpopularity.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all the spies have been compromised and that she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And this means Johnny English himself, who is working as a schoolteacher in some fancy institution now, but giving secret lessons on how to be a spy: some good jokes here, as English runs a spy school similar to School of Rock.
English is transported back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former partner Bough, played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine is cast.
So Batman and Robin get things wrong again at Her Majesty's service, coming across Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is busy being roused by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to deal with Britain's computer problems: Jason Vola played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their hilarious journey: dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; create a riot while trying to board Volta's luxury ship; and English causes complete chaos while trying to use a Virtual device to identify himself inside Volta's house
They make a good show of it in the last scene, but as fun and messy as it is, there's a little bit of a children's TV feel to the whole thing.
Very clever.
And as with all the other Johnny English films I couldn't help but wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that makes her a match for her talents?
Labour Party denies it is preparing a plan to make the British people work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would mean British people work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company heads to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to their workers by giving them an extra day off.
This would mean workers would have a three-day weekend - but the same pay.
Sources say the idea would be in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of the workers.
A change to a four-day week has been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a rapidly changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight but a four-day week is an ambition that is in line with the party's pro-worker approach to restructuring the economy as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Greens promising a four-day workweek during their campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at present the ambition is not endorsed by all Labour.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a party policy that is not taken into account by the party".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's party conference to expand his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to get the power back from the "unknown directors" and "professors" of the public resources companies.
The opposition's branch plans also mean that existing water company shareholders will not be fully funded back as the Labour government could make "decisions" based on apparent malice.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and created Universal Ownership Funds to put 10 per cent of private sector companies' equity in the hands of workers, who would receive annual distributions of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could cause any Republican senator to withdraw their support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might reveal something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", Kennedy said.
I told you before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusations came out, I said, "You're going to stop doing this?"
He was decisive, determined and unyielding.
However, Graham's vote to see it was strong.
"I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a terrible indictment", he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was totally in denial", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one could say what he had done.
I'm 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is World Population Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York City will host the World Population Festival, an annual musical event that features a spectacular list of star-studded participants and an equally impressive message: eradicate global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Population Festival will see tens of thousands of people take to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, as well as to raise awareness of the festival's main purpose of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Population Day, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Initiative, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who want to fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket) visitors had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call or anything else of value to help raise awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful have the World Citizenship Festivals been with only 12 years to reach their goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a good way to persuade people to demand change or just another case of "clicktivism" - people feeling they're making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a petition?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Festival says it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, aimed at a range of goals.
They say these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth $37 billion that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In the autumn of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and publications stemming from its actions, with at least $10 billion of them classified or raised.
The group estimates that the funding approved so far has had a direct impact on the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and activists committed to 'helping children reach their full potential', pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate nutritional deficiencies in the country after receiving over 47,00 referrals from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, stakeholders, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history, Tracey Ullman, ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group said the government had announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritious food, after over 5,000 actions were made calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, which asked what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?
The Global Citizenship Festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy for surveillance to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use the Navy if necessary to block energy from Russia from reaching the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that Russia's intervention in Syria - specifically, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
'I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to deal with energy as they do in Eastern Europe, and Southern Europe,' he was quoted as saying.
And, according to the officer, there are ways to deal with this.
The US has the ability, with the Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to blockade them, to make sure that their goods don't reach the market, he said.
Zinke was greeting the audience at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's methods of dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are more or less the same.
The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, to put pressure and replace fuel, he said, noting that Russia's economy is completely dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come as the Trump administration seeks to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the cheapest option down the road for consumers in Europe.
In the meantime Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline's unjustified plan, which Trump says makes Berlin a liability to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly reiterated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a purely economic project that will double the existing capacity to 110 cubic meters.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's staunch opposition to the project is caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the belief that energy cannot be used to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has attracted a strong response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Hardly Consider" Running for President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "hardly consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she had considered running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will be seriously considering running for the presidency.
Warren gave his opinion of Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my core about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump and his nomination for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
But a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's constituents do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not stand behind a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported such an effort.
The polls showed much greater support for an effort by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a possible effort and 48 percent against.
Other Democratic names that have been mentioned as possible candidates in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin refers to PTSD Track Palin in a rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can sympathize with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the bruises that some of our soldiers are coming back with", he told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the elephant in the room and said of his son and other ex-soldiers, "They come back different, they come back stronger and they come back asking if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the armed forces have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assault of a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a challenge to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gangs.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. presented a peer-to-peer briefing Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who defied the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the appellant in the case Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
He said his partner, a violent gang member, had been charged but U.S. officials denied his request for bail on July 20.
He was held in custody in Nhexas.
The provincial tourists who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce many asylum seekers in the US, as countries facing major problems with domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to apply for asylum if they were fleeing domestic violence.
District of Columbia State Attorney Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy  ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that any application for leave to appeal be granted on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle, said the friend-of-the-court.
The tournament's organizers further argued that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country was hurting the U.S. economy, saying they were more likely to be entrepreneurs and provide needed labor.
State Attorney Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to individuals who wish to leave their home countries because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion, said Sessions when announcing the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was not going to alleviate all the problems - even the serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Disastrous rescue efforts in Paul as the death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly critical.
"I feel very anxious", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, who was comforting her sick son at an immigration centre in Palu.
Every minute an ambulance comes and brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The inhabitants were seen returning to their destroyed houses, searching through their possessions, trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of injured people and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the sick, including Julius Caesar, who had been stricken in parts, were lying in the open air outside the barracks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of the earthquake shaking the fifth-floor room of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I got squeezed into the walls, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife crying for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they're safe.
The US Embassy accuses Tsiena of bullying with propaganda messages
A week after one of China's official newspapers ran a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the US promoting trade benefits between the US and China, the US embassy to China has accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily's appendix in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's most popular newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, accusations China denies.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections was another step in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place trade-promoting notices, Beijing and Washington are currently fighting an escalating trade war that has led to the two countries imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China's tariffs early in the trade war were designed to target exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, U.S. and China experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a significant exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "China is now confirming that bullying by running propaganda ads in our free press".
"In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's important tradition of free speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newsstand down the street in Beijing, you would find it difficult to find dissenting voices and you would not see a true reflection of the diverse ideas that the Chinese people have about China's troubled economic path, as the press is under the heritage of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that  one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined the offer to publish his article, though he did not say which paper.
Analysts Warn Republicans Are Excluding Women from Voting Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh's Plain
As many progressive Republicans support Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination in the face of multiple sexual misconduct allegations, analysts have warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions about this have been very high, and most Republicans on record have already said they want to go ahead with the vote.
You can't take these things back", Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's (Ariz.) last-minute effort to get an FBI investigation would be enough to placate unhappy voters.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior councillor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senedd courtyard as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is going to be enormous, Stu Rothenburg, a non-profit political analyst, told the news website.
People say they are enthusiastic; it is true.
But it could increase, especially among insecure women on the outskirts of towns and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they dislike the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony described his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nomination, analysis suggested that there would be a strong response if the Republicans went ahead with the nomination.
"This has developed into a complete disaster for the Republicans", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier last week.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put on the bench, it's also about the way the Republicans have handled this and the way they have treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities ISA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem to be divided over who to vote for following the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, with a slightly more acrimonious view of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov opinion poll shows that 41% of respondents either definitely or not believe Ford's testimony, while 35% say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38% said they believed with certainty or likelihood that Kavanaugh had lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's campaign, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford along with at least one other suspect, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford gave oral testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked him by a drunk driver when he was 17.
Ramirez alleges that Kavanaugh, who has been nominated for the Supreme Court, dissected her genitals while they were at a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a new company that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology pioneer's new project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid lets users choose where their data is stored and who wants access to what information.
In a selected interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee predicted that the Inrupt company's goal was "rule the world".
"We have to do it now", he says of the company.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online database or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on one browser and I'm on it at the same time.
What is unique about the online personal data warehouse is that it is entirely up to the user who wants to see what kind of information.
The company calls it personal data authorization.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help ensure that Solid is available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform from IBM, developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change where their business models are completely transformed overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's intention is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem to help safeguard the accuracy and quality of the new web being created on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over the Internet's versatility.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Consortium, and the Open Data Foundation.
"I am very optimistic about this next week in the history of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Cleric of the Victoria Cross celebrated World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a fighter in the First World War has been commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
The Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vanny won a medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later unaware that he had won Britain's highest military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two of his men on a march in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his wives, Michael Vann, said it was highly symbolic that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his father's prize-winning race.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1928 Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his fatal crossing of the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick fog and attacks by field guns and machine guns.
Later he ran to the landing line and with the greatest courage led the line forward before running into a field on his own and landing three of the crew.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his father's actions were something "I can never compare but I feel inferior to someone".
He and his brother Doctor James Vann set up a torch after the race, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be part of the race" adding "real heroic courage is shown by the support that is being given by so many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pink in their place.
Imagine this, you've been up all night watching Bellator 206 only to be banned from the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 horns, including a chequered main card and was shown live across the goal in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to face off, UK viewers were left in shock as the screen switched to Peppa Pink.
Some were unhappy at the cold because they had to stay on their feet all night, especially to watch the swarm.
One Twitter fan described the change to kindergarten as "some kind of bad joke".
"Government regulations said content was not suitable after 6am so we had to switch to children's programmes", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
The pig's paper, yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
I think when we think about the re-appearance, we can make it work, says Coker.
But it is six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we cannot deal with him until it is Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the programs changed there were a lot of text messages going back and forth and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the problem, it was a government issue.
I promise this won't happen next time.
We'll have to keep it to five horns instead of six - as usual - we tried to give too much to the fans and it took a long time.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Plumber Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old plumber said he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like me.
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs to be presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was speaking about gay rights in order to give hope to other people.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The long-established show's regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt inferior to everyone else growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: "Today, those feelings of feeling less than, of feeling different, have given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic silver medalist swimmer has become a prominent LGBT activist who used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without consequences and he wanted to give hope to other people.
The world champion said falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - was unexpected.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, last year but said the age gap has never been an issue.
When someone goes through something so young, she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said it was hard to find someone her age who had lived through similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "perspective hole" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
But there are more important things than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
Her son shares the same name as her father Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 again - he wanted to be in the front row.
I can't tell him you're not going to be around to be in the front row", she said.
I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only after he stopped breathing and was dead did I recognize he was not unconscious", she said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a silver medal.
I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to stand in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it felt like nothing", she said.
He also inspired his first choice of centers - Proud by Heather Small - which had been in operation since before the Olympics and still gave him a glowing skin.

Mickelson, who is not at his best on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to improve his standard to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the biennial event for the 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk on Saturday for the four-a-side games.
Rather than being in the middle of the action, as has often been the case in the United States, Mickelson, who has won five majors, split his day between being a fan and working on his game in the hope of improving his problems.
Since the fastest rider was not even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not a good choice for the Le Golf National drag course, where the long roughness punishes curved shots.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickleson, in Sunday's ninth game, faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points down at the start of the 12 single game, get off to a good start, Mickelson's game could be absolutely vital.
Furyk showed confidence in her man, although there was nothing else she could do.
He understood the role he had today, he patted my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow, Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was expecting more, but then it worked out and then we thought we needed to go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never reached the high points of his single record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk says his presence is an unreasonable boost for the team.
"He's a bit of a bully, sarcastic, a bit of a prankster, he likes to make fun of people, he's a great person to have in the teamroom", she explained.
I think the young players are having fun making fun of themselves too, this week, it was nice to see.
It's a contribution that goes far beyond just a joke.
Captain Europe Thomas Bjorn knows that big profits can disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the final day of individual matches in the Ryder Cup can turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane had his first game at Valderrama in 1997, where a team captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but by the finish line the advantage was down to a purple thickness with Europe winning from 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
Remember that we have a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won only by a blistering blister", says Bjorn, in the photo, after watching the 2018 team win 5 to 3 on Friday and yesterday to lead 10 to 6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone else on the team that this is not over.
You must train your best tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have all the points on the table.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the cup, and that's where we're going to focus.
I've said from the beginning, I'm focused on the 12 players in our squad, but we're also aware of what it's like to be standing on top - the best players in the world.
He was pleased with the way his players have performed on a hard golf course, adding: "I would never be proud of this.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow, the individual performances will come first, and that's a completely different thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there by yourself, you're just too experienced as a golfer.
That's the message we need to give to the players, that you do your best tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner and he has to do his best too.
Unlike Bjorn, American captain Jim Furyk will want his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points out of four.
Furyk has been on both ends of the big wins on the final day, as he was part of the team that won in Brookline before losing after Europe secured the Wonder in Medina.
"I remember every word of it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, gave his players a boost before the final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to start fast like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medinah.
When the momentum goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those games in the middle.
We're setting up our line like this and putting the men out like we want, we're trying to do something amazing tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight back and faces Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other European players in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of players in this order because I believe they will work well all the way", said Bjorn about his selection for the singles matches.
Germany's new warship has been delayed once again
The German navy's new frigate was supposed to have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships, but will not be available until next year at least due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media said.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman for the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems after its delivery have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will reportedly include powerful cannons, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as radar signature, infrared and dimming.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - new refrigerators should be able to be stored for up to two years away from their home ports.
But continued delays mean that the innovative warships - which will allow Germany to throw off its power over the sea - will be out of service by the time they enter service, Die Zeit said.
The F125's refurbishment made headlines last year, after the German Navy refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to shipbuilders after it was delivered.
The reasons behind the return of the ship were unclear, but German media pointed to a number of critical software and hardware flaws that meant the warship was only good if it had to fight.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be run by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the numbers on the Bremen-class frigates.
Also, it became apparent that the ship was overweight, which worsened her performance and reduced the Navy's ability to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the cost of the whole project - including the training of the crew - is starting to be a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from €2.2bn initially.
The problems of the new frigates are becoming ever more important given recent warnings that the German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy was jumping out of ships that could be trusted.
The official said that the problem had worsened over time, as old ships had been decommissioned without new ships being supplied in their place.
She argued that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the hidden lives of the underdogs
New research is being carried out on a stopover in the Scottish Highlands which seeks to reveal how seagulls use the landscape to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the unique behaviour of the mammals and help with future conservation activities.
The study by National Trust scientists will follow the common bass drum on the soprano bass drum along with the long-necked bass drum and water drum at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in important locations around the site to monitor the activity of the snails throughout the season.
The NHS volunteers and staff will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
Expert sound analysis of the recordings will find out the frequency of the calls of the insects and which species are doing what.
A report and a climate map will then be produced to create a detailed landscape size picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will show which habitats are most important for the slugs and how they are used by all species.
The information will help to determine the benefits of climate management work such as creating hedges and how to manage forests for shrubs and other related species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect their lives and lead to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also be dangerous, along with insect-trapping paper and some chemicals in building materials, and attacks by cats.
Blind people are not blind.
But because they hunt at night their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching their food.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to spot insects and obstacles in front of them.
The National Trust for Scotland owns more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and over 76,000 hectares across the country and is very concerned about wetlands.
They have ten trained specialists, who carry out regular inspections, visits to the clinics and occasionally save money.
The organisation has established Scotland's first mollusc sanctuary at Threave Stardust in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eighty of Scotland's mollusc species.
Park manager David Thompson said the park's landscape was perfect for them.
Here in Threave we have a great area for a swimming pool, he said.
We have many old buildings, many old trees and all the good climate.
But there is much we don't know about ants, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what is needed for them to thrive.
It emphasises the search for molluscs before any maintenance work is carried out in buildings as one moth netting could destroy up to 400 female and juvenile molluscs, possibly killing the entire local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or kill them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish Wildlife Conservation Trust officer, has been urging the public to lend a hand.
He said: We have so much to learn about our instincts and with many of our species we don't know whether their populations are doing well or not.
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of violence as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the allegations of violence against him "fake news", saying people "wanted to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of assaulting an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
In, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in an Instagram Live video to 142 million followers hours after the allegations were confirmed, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, this is not a game.
What they said today is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to prosecute Der Spiegel over the allegations, allegations they have called an unacceptable expression of doubt in a private matter, according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for a moral level of a staggering amount commensurate with the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious human rights offences in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are ordered to return to the player's room, where he physically assaulted her, according to papers filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that 99 per cent was a good  that was disappointed by the one per cent.
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga claims she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was a victim and worried about public embarrassment.
The 34-year-old woman said she was trying to reverse the arrangement as she continued to be harmed by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from United Fancinion when the alleged attack happened, and this summer he moved to Italian side Juve for €100 million.
Brexit: UK would regret losing carmakers forever
The UK would forever regret losing its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
She added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would temporarily stop producing cars at its Burnaston factory near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a deal", said Mr Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said delays at the border could lead to job losses if a no-deal Brexit were to happen.
The Burnaston factory - which builds Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year and almost 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
'I think if Britain were to leave the EU at the end of March, construction would stop at our factory,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close its Mini factory in London for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about what the carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just in time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars that are to be built to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, problems that the industry says would lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than two days of stock in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so construction would have to be halted.
Mr Clarke said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was carefully crafted to avoid such border checks.
We need a deal.We want the best deal that will allow us to succeed in the present and take advantage of this opportunity", he told Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with a series of delivery chains that have been very successful.
Toyota could not say how long production would take, but in the long run, it warned that additional costs would affect the factory's ability to compete and would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a Unite union organiser at the factory, said his members were increasingly worried: 'In my experience once these jobs are gone they don't come back.
A government spokesperson said: We have proposed a detailed and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with state representative Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for another week as the battle over Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will dismiss the state department representative, thereby jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has been a topic of conversation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a device to record his conversations with Trump along with the possibility of removing the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein hated the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, with word that he was about to resign.
But instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would have preferred not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women he accused of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "There is no date set for that yet, it could be this week. I can see it being postponed for another week because of all the other things that are happening in the supreme court.
But we'll see if I always like to keep the press updated.
Some critics would doubt that claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace called out why.
Sanders said that dislike of the orchestra of TV journalists was not the reason for the lack of briefing, although he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they are abusive".
He then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is holding more Q&A sessions than any previous president, he said, adding without citing any evidence: We have looked at those numbers.
Sanders said the briefing would continue, but if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do a lot of that in the last few weeks.
Trump often receives questions when leaving the White House or when participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president showed why, making controversial appearances and at times in front of reporters.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers in Scotland's NHS over concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff who want to work for the NHS in Scotland to express their appreciation in the country and wish them to stay there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay the costs of applying for permanent resident status for EU citizens who want to work for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving continued, with decisions expected in the autumn.
But the UK government has also been intensifying preparations for the possibility of a 'no-deal' situation.
I know that this period is sure to be a turbulent one for all of you.
That is why I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of every staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Collaborators across the EU and beyond bring invaluable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we very much wish you would stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the team's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Rees told reporters that the injury occurred a few minutes before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and some kind of bump there", Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and releasing him back for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come back from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there were no details on the type of injury or how bad the injury was yet and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt freshman, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the season total to 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, and the extra money is used to provide help for the homeless under new Tory schemes.
This proposal would neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
This increase in stamp duty will be put on those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Treasury expects it to raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This proposal will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target those who earn high salaries.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and companies who do not pay UK taxes.The additional money will boost the Government's intention to tackle people sleeping out.
The surplus - a significant additional to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-let homes - can be as much as three per cent.
The Treasury expects this proposal to cost up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of brand new properties in London are bought by residents from outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become 'settlement towns' because so many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
She accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high when buying land but not using it, and challenged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to repair the housing shortages in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of impressive housing reforms, including rental control and ending homelessness.
He also wants to give more power to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: Last year, I said I would dedicate my job as prime minister to restoring the British dream - that life would be better for all new generations.
And that means fixing our flawed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and create here.
However, it cannot be right that buying a home is as easy for non-UK individuals, as well as companies based abroad, as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is far from within reach, and the prospect of sleeping out on the streets remains far too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to be Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is eager for the challenge of rebuilding the North West club, currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's it", Ross told Sportsound, Scotland's BBC programme.
When I was a kid, I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden quite a bit with my father, and it's something I've always been drawn to.
That opportunity will only come to me if I manage a successful club.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he had no fear of following such strong names at such a big club, and he has turned down previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich.
My success right now will be to see if I can lead this club back to the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it belongs to the Premier League without a doubt", he said.
It's not going to be an easy task to get the club there, but I probably wouldn't consider myself successful unless I could get the club back there.
It's only been three years since Ross started his managerial career, having spent time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped lift Alloa after they were relegated to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from relegation to the top of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever has during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a bit of a fateful point", he said of taking the lead in Alloa.
I really believed that being a manager was the right career for me, more so than being a player.
He hath heard of my righteousness, and of my life of righteousness, and of my going up to the heights.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things to do on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through it in terms of the stress and the workload but control feels good.
I always wanted to be a manager and having achieved that, I now feel more satisfied with my life than ever.

The perfect time for a pint is 5.30 on a Saturday night, according to a survey.
The hot summer weather has boosted the profits of Britain's struggling restaurants, but has put more strain on restaurant chains.
Bar and restaurant groups saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but there was a 4.8 percent decline in restaurant earnings, according to figures.
Peter Martin of the CGA business consultancy firm that compiled the figures said: Because the hot weather has continued, and England has stayed in the World Cup longer than expected, a pattern fairly similar to June and July, where restaurants saw a 2.8 per cent increase, but restaurants have suffered more than ever.
After the 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June, things got worse in July.
Bars and pubs selling drinks performed best seeing more growth than restaurants saw from loss.
Smaller restaurants also struggled to focus on selling food because of the sun, although not as many people were running restaurants.
It seems that going out for a drink was all people wanted to do.
Across the bars and bars that are regulated, there was a 6.6 per cent increase in beverage sales for the month, while there was a three per cent decrease in food.
Paul Newman of leisure and hospitality analytics firm RSM said: "These results show a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain key factors in sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that dining groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8 per cent year-on-year decline is sure to be painful as well as ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for people who want to run restaurants to focus on selling food, and a cheaper time when the more moderate temperatures of August will give some much-needed rest.
In July, there was a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in restaurants and eateries, including new ones opened.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sales monitor for the UK restaurant and dining sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups.
One in five children have hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have hidden social media accounts that they keep from their parents and teachers, a survey found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta pages.
The news has heightened concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a "major" account to show to parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns that content of a sexual nature is being posted.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a main account suitable to show to parents, while they also had some private ones.
One mother came across the hiding place of her 13-year-old daughter and saw a teenager encouraging others to "fix me".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, has found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, and half of them admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online sites that parents and teachers cannot find.
Eilidh Doyle will be the athlete's spokesperson on the Scottish Athletes' Board.
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director.
Doyle is Scotland's most successful track and field athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a great opportunity for those who want to lead the sport to benefit from its wide range of experience at international level over the last decade.
Eilidh is highly respected across the Scottish, UK and global athletic communities, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would greatly benefit from having him on the table, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I want to be a voice for athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics on top of his four other Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular on the BBC, but was unable to walk after suffering a bout of temporary ischemia.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke today.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would get better or how well.
It was a struggle but I'm fully recovered, I've learned how to walk again and today I'm doing some stretching exercises!
Thank you for all the messages of encouragement!
The variety of opinions online about a pump ad almost equals comparing moms to cows
Online opinions have varied due to an advertisement by a near-fat pump company comparing mothers who feed to cattle being milked.
To mark the launch of what is being called the world's first wearable near-distanced pump, tech goods company Elvie has released a cell-virus ad in the form of a music video to show the freedom the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a field of grass and cattle, to a soundtrack that includes words like: "Yes, I'm cutting myself, but you can't see the top" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't towers, but bridges".
The covenant goes on: "Pump out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I touch the babies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, has been the subject of an online fire.
With 77,000 people viewing the video and hundreds commenting, it has received a mixed response among viewers, with some saying it does not convey the dairy industry's "destruction" in any serious way.
Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them within days of giving birth, wrote one.
Elvie's near-in-sight pump fits inside a nursing home (Elvie/Mam)
Another said: "It's understandable that this is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise pumps for mothers who want to keep their baby?
And another said, A preacher is he that understandeth not the world.
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted she saw the song in exaggerated terms.
This is a great idea.
I would have had one if I had kept feeding on the breast.
Pumping made me feel just like a bubble.
The ad was a little hurtful but I took it for what it was.
This is a great product, wrote one
Another said: This is a fun ad aimed at moms who pump (often in the workplace or shops) and feel like cow.
The advertisement neither praises nor criticizes the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the group of girls reveal that they have been dancing with the pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the belief that many women who pump their breasts feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits a lid inside a nursing cage, giving women the freedom to move, touch their baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother said: Elvie's pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a prominent and prestigious launch.
In showing the similarity between breast pumps and breast cattle we wanted to highlight breast pumps and all their challenges, showing the incredible freedom that comes from the new pump in a subtle and relevant way.
This is not the first time Elvie's bomb has hit the front pages.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on stage for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the products.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Silently Moved to Camp on the Texas Border
The number of migrant children being prevented from fleeing has increased sharply although the numbers crossing the border each month have not changed much.This is partly because the strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration make it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been immigrants themselves without a right to be in the country, and they have been concerned about jeopardising their right to stay in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective sponsors and other adults in the house would have to be fingerprinted, and that the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior director of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, testified before Congress that they had arrested dozens of people who had tried to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Almost 80 per cent of individuals who are sponsors or members of the same household as sponsors are living in the country illegally, and a large number of these are foreign criminals.
So we continue to go after those individuals", says Mr Albence.
To process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the norm, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference call, rather than in person, to plead a case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for assistance will be sent out of the country empty-handed.
According to asylum workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children are in detention the more likely they are to feel anxious or low-spirited.
Advocates say such concerns are worse in a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering can be ignored, because of its size.
It added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma many are struggling with.
Syria tells the occupying forces of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in the country now enters its eightieth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops on Syrian soil are illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will be dealt with appropriately.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the assembly.
Moualem said the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until we had cleared all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on foot in the war-torn country.
In discussing refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances were right for them to return, and blamed some western countries for "spreading unreasonable fears" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the process of their return, he said.
They have made a completely humanitarian issue a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a listening zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to push ahead with political talks.
Thanks to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live, was averted.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "definite time limits" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including Nusra Front fighters who are linked to Al-Qaeda, which would "bring about their destruction".
With this, Staffan de Mistura, the UN chief hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee that will include members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying that the panel's job would be to review the existing articles of the constitution, and warned against interfering.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
If that is accepted, Mr. Trump could be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberals hope he is, an ambitious and scandalous presidency ends soon.
And that would, without a doubt, be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At this point, there are no signs that the spectators are tired.
Since 2014, peak hour figures have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
On average, Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show has outperformed cable TV viewing figures with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a text that appeals to people because we don't understand it", says Neal Baer, the runner-up on ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on the capital.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" Ms. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the midst of chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the state of the wider world economy.
Only the most privileged viewers have the ability to turn off the TV.
And yet, it's no longer being an informed citizen when you realize that you're on the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of the words "intense background" as he tracked down information for his book "Man", "Paul Manafort's $15,000 strawberry short jacket" (a "shirt with too much pride", according to the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's chilling descriptions of, say, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I personally will never be able to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what makes it feel like a reality show is that it feeds you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about Trump's characters being rotated around the daily story lines (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single chapter or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sleeping inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't leave the screen, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in question.
I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows for a long time and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of the Western insult", Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but the truth is they're right.

Money from outside flowing into the midterm House races
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is receiving a flood of money, thanks to congressional redistricting that means two incumbents are in the race for the same seat.
The recently redrawn Pittsburgh metropolitan area favours Democrat Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps significantly with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties were unconstitutionally unfair to the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a campaign finance battle between the main party funding branches, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a highly publicized contest in March in a special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
A Republican had held the seat for over a decade, and President Trump won the region by 20 points.
Political pundits say the Democrats are ahead.
U.S. deliberates on sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little unfavorable response from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heated meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017. He had a hotel in Panama until partners turned the Trump Foundation management team out.
State Department officials decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decisions to refuse to recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
Sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, which included drug control, economic aid and development.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials convened a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administrative officials made clear they wanted the conference to go ahead, thus ending any consideration of sanctioning El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence had been asked to address the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the argument described by the three American officials, which included two diplomats who agreed to speak about the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
The reports were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
A study of history
It is possible that the next big event will be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possibility that Mr. Trump obstructed justice, where substantial evidence is now in public records.
Apparently Mr. Mueller also discusses in his report whether Mr. Trump's campaign conspired with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to face accountability to that body, and he's preparing to go before voters again, and perhaps a jury of his peers sooner or later.
There's a lot of uncertainty about that, and I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor its counterparts in Europe.
Choices need to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact throughout the effort.
In 1938 German officials were prepared to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the years of conflict that had been.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the relentless journey of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans face many of these conversion points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy State Attorney Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the backbone of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water ever since this paper reported last year, that he suggested recording the president in secret and suggested he was unfit for the job.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
How do we respond if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault allegations and dishonest testimony?
Above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congressional party that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass those tests, it will be hard on democracy.
But I think we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Marrakesh.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika board.
And that's part of my heritage, how can I not be hopeful about the future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers team was confident before playing against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against Austria, following the draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, means they are in a good position to qualify from Europa League Group G.
A knee injury meant Graham Dorrans was unable to play this season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes the Rangers can use that result to achieve great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game thinking we could get something and we came out of there with a point.
We may have been beaten in the end but, overall, a draw was a fairer than likely outcome.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and we were the better team.
As for Thursday night, it's another great European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be difficult because they got a good result in their last game but with the crowd supporting us, I'm sure we can work hard and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely challenging, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes that were made at the club itself, but it feels good in the place now.
The squad is good and the boys are having a great time; the practice is good.
Hopefully we can keep going now, forgetting about last season and succeeding.
Women lose sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that survey participants had a good idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is where it starts.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not inform them of your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you receive care, as those choices can be important factors in determining the cost.
You should include your financial adviser: Your adviser can help you think about how to pay for those costs too.
Your options for financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to cover those costs or self-insurance against your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Develop your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Make sure you have healthcare records, as you appoint a person you trust to supervise your medical care to make sure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider a lawyer for your financial matters.
You would choose someone you trust to make your financial decisions for you and to make sure your bills are paid if you can afford to.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
It's more than financial issues, who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make that plan.
A man has been shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
With communications cut off, rescue officials have been unable to get any information from Donggala forecast, an area in northern Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been displaced after the earthquake struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a steep-sided depression extending over more than 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.
The prefecture, an administrative area under a province, had a population target of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic drivers of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal Donggala area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but most of that work takes place in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of the island.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific Seismic Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that lashed the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A predictive earthquake hit Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing devastation and fear as people were reminded of the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and dangerous tsunami.
This time no tsunami was caused, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Lombok, a tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son is arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female confessor tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she took away his phone.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Concentration Complex and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was innocent, definite when asked about his whereabouts, according to the network.
Palin faces three counts of Class A misdemeanor, which means she could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, breach of domestic violence crime reporting, and possession of a drunken handgun in connection with the incident.
Her lover claimed he had put a dot on her face.
Sarah Pilan was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's threatening behavior to PTSD stemming from his time serving in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Sulawesi, an island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the central Sulawesi region, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being shared on social media showing the time of the event.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the island.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the maximum punishment for the man suspected of carrying out the horrific attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the maximum sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the horrific attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence not handed out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented from Home Depot to attack a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists in his path in October.
To justify the maximum sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "willfully" killed the eight individuals and "willfully" caused serious bodily harm, according to the intent to seek the maximum sentence warning, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both courts can impose the maximum penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of murder for fraud, charges usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and planning", describing Saipov's attack as "vicious, cruel and corrupt".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the warning of intent said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York introduced the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the maximum sentence was imposed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were exonerated after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the citation.
He also asked for an ISIS banner in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said they were "apparently disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the maximum punishment rather than accept a guilty verdict of life in prison without the possibility of release only extends the trauma of these events to all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked prosecutors not to seek the maximum sentence.
As a conservative says Nigel Barrage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to "act on the voice of the people" today during a protest at the Dorian conference.
The former UKIP leader said that politicians must "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptic members - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she should be responsible for EU negotiations.
At the Birmingham race, Peter Bone, a Conservative backbencher, said that the UK would now be leaving if Mr Farage were not Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in rebuilding her deeply divided ranks is based on pro-Brexit Dorians joining another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is having a hard time keeping her Chequers plan in order amid attacks from pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and pro-EU people.
Allies have insisted that she will still try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - forcing both MEPs and Labour members to choose between her package and the EU.
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted a Chequers table.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been made a lord and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If it had been responsible, we would have gone out by now, he said.
Wellingborough MP added: I will stand for Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be secondary.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely wrong.
Andrea Jenkyns, a Tory Brexit MP, was also on the march and told reporters: "I say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the Conservatives are not going to vote for the plan, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who are taking to the streets to vote for us in the first place.
Don't go on with Chequers and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, he added: Chief ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the pressure" if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now it's about trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel that pressure.
We are acting on the voice of the people of the country that secured our victory over Brexit and we will continue until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-Remain protesters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tory Anti-Brexit banners after the group's launch this weekend.
One of the Labour lords, Lord Adoins, made fun of the Conservatives for the security issues they had with the party's ap at the opening conference.
"It's true that people tell us they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for the Canada plus plus deal, for smooth borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he said.
It's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren is serious about running for president
Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator, says she will consider running for president in detail after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a GOP state representative, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been much speculation that she might compete against Trump in 2020.
At the event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, she met with voters for the 36th time using the city format since Trump took office.
Someone present asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren said it was time for his daughters to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top.
Arrested after Sims of LSU was shot to death
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that someone had been arrested on suspicion of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims to death on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that it has arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11 a.m.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died instantly as a result", Murphy J. Paul, a top police officer, told the media on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene, possessing a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without investigation and was placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games, starting 10 of them last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton moves closer to the world title after the team's order helped him win the lead over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear after Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team layout would play a big part in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton in trouble as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack a team member.
Vettel went for the first hole, allowing Hamilton to reach the traffic at the end of the pack, something that should have been fatal.
The Mercedes went into the pit later coming out behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after coming to himself and saw the Ferrari driver, unhappy, leave the inside free in danger of getting caught going after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race as he kept going in his eagerness to finish quickly and passed Kimi Raikkonen to secure fourth place.
In the end the pulleys came on lap 44 but he was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen came in fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri has done great all weekend and he was a decent man to let me pass.
The team did a great job to get a two", said Hamilton.
That's a good body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not share a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee for the Supreme Court, of sexual misconduct.
Speaking at a rally in Northern Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the evidence Ford gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were hateful and evil and lying.
The same thing could happen with the blessed thing that has been going on in the last few days in the Senedd, when you see the anger, when you see people who are hateful and mean and lying", he said.
When you look at the statements and the documents that are being shared and then they say, "No, I didn't.
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you share the letter?
Remember his answer... you shared the document - oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't share the document.
Well, wait a minute.
We shared the document...No, we didn't", he added, mocking the MP.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was shared in early September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been shared by a member of his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't share his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
And she asked me to keep the letter secret, and I did as she had asked.
But the president did not seem to believe him, and remarked during the Saturday night meeting: "If I tell you something, his body language was very bad.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three girls, the president suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the hatred, the greed, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to step on to gain power and control", the president said according to Meditate.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scores two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for losing in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early as Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuvillier scored two goals.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to level the home team score before Dwyer recovered the Giants' victory.
Francois Bouchard scored for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
This was the third time Adam Keefe's men have lost in the Elite League this season, a team that had unexpectedly beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth time the teams have met this season, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping as Beauvillier doubled the score four minutes later.
In a hectic opening period, Sullivan and the home team came back to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt helped provide Cownie's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead in the first half as he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team rallied and, once again, Bouchard ensured they had a level score with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time in the game late in the second period and secured the win by scoring his team's fifth goal halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies to ensure that hundreds on a plane can escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many are trapped in rubble in the city of Pau.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the highly seismic control tower at Palu airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought he was falling.
He died later in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision had saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We had a coach ready from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport us to a larger hospital in another city.
We had no trouble getting to the port before the next morning.
Hearing the news is heartbreaking, she said.
Meanwhile, authorities are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands with the disaster mitigation agency saying access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
The number is likely to continue to rise because many bodies are still under the mosquitoes and many bodies we have not yet reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Twenty-five feet of waves have broken Paul, who will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in support and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is bringing bodies here every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
People steal from the small supermarkets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
The situation is already dire, but it could get much worse.
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks that are related to the movement and transportation.
Are you ready?" CNN said.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that caused 550 deaths.
Airline crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes in a lagoon
The airline that was flying the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after saying all 47 passengers and crew managed to escape the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that they had not seen a single man traveling on the plane since Sunday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials say seven people were taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline said six people were still in hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what caused the accident and how it happened.
The airline and the United States Navy have said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crashed.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had flown in very low.
"That's a very good thing", says Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to walk through water to their centers at the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew was shouting and screaming, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors were working to improve nearby caves and had helped rescue people by using a wind boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in PNG-registered aircraft accidents in the last two decades but none of those included New Guinea Air.
Analyst presents timeline of the night the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors presented his case Saturday in the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He outlined to the jury how he used cellphone records to create a full picture of the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from multiple mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night she died, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone during the time he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday saying he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's office that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my office was in Nashville.
Another discrepancy was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers's text messages, calls and contact information from her phone sometime after she died.
"He took it out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots, which are political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to those roots and make hip hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a new wave of support in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nani from New York is suing a couple for firing her following a text message
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discrimination against her and her dismissal after she received a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she was another black person.
The couple denies being racist, saying the situation is as if someone is trying to make a profit.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed to find that the childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"NOTHING WAS AWAY from the outside". Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, rather than sending the message to her husband, she sent the message to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt "disgusted", fired Ms. Maurice, saying that their old grandmother, who was African-American, had done a terrible job and that she would rather wait for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal, and she is seeking $350 a day for the six-month accommodation work she was originally hired to do, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do things like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is a case of discrimination".
The couple have criticized the allegations of being racist, saying that ending Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, as they were worried they could not trust her after her anger.
My wife sent him something she didn't mean to say.
She's not racist.
We are not a racist people", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you put your children in the care of someone you have been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I don't think so.
Comparing the legal case to the "condition of someone trying to profit", Plasco said that his wife was expecting a baby in two weeks and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do", says the investment banker.
Although the legal case was still ongoing, it was a long time before a court of public opinion condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear readers will not identify with the speaking dialect, according to a new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to step into the shoes of someone who wants to read it for the first time before it's published.
Now, it's very strange to know what we know about Paddington's overwhelming success.
He said his father, who had been working as a camera man for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book by a small dog, would have accepted if his work had been rejected, but added that celebrating 60 years since the books' publication was a "sorry" feeling following his death last year.
He said his father was proud of Paddington's subsequent success quietly, describing the horse as a very important member of the family.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a proud man", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who wants to achieve something: you're proud of the child even though you don't really feel responsible for his success.
I think he considers Paddington's success that way.
Although the work was his creation and his imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
'She called us regularly to say things were very bad, and she wasn't expected to come through,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs she had been given by the doctors to keep her heart beating were starting to stop and leave her system.
She had died a little before and now everything was shutting down.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to be brave.
After a long and late flight, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, was taken on the side plane alongside the other passengers - who were unaware of her predicament.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down, and tears flowed all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane I felt a deep sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning post cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two girls who have lost loved ones to suicide work to prevent others from ending their own lives.
Sharon Davies and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on bridges in Wales with inspirational messages and phone numbers people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel every day, she says.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook and had an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
They always said that her smile would light up any room.
But he ceased his work before he died, because he was in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he killed himself.
Ms Davis said: I am always worried that it will have an impact again later.
Ms Davis designed the cards, to let people know that there are people they can reach out to and talk to, even if they're friends.
Don't sit in silence - you have to talk.
Ms Humphreys has been friends with Ms Davis for years, and she lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after he lost his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sad or low or anything like that", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in her attitude.
It had reached the bottom of one Christmas Day - when the children were opening their presents he hadn't made any eye contact with them or anything like that.
He said that his death had been a great shock to them, but they had to come through him: "He tore a hole through my house.
He's cutting us to pieces.
But we must all carry on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought, if we could get something like he was asking for - a time-limited inquiry, limited in scope - maybe we could achieve some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking up" in the middle of a sudden partisan legislative debate.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their uncertainty is about timing.
There are only five weeks until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush had been picking up the phone to call Senators, pressuring them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, where he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the Senedd, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to reach a decision and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korean refugee numbers decline under Kim's leadership
The number of North Koreans fleeing to South Korea has fallen since Jim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug said, citing data from the South's united administration, there were 1,127 cases of escape last year - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tougher border control processes between North Korea and China and the higher rates of human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Most people who flee the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul said more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas.
China refers to those who want to flee as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and it often forces them back into their own country.
Relations between the North and South - which are still technically at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the stalled denuclearization talks.
This followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, as they had a heated discussion about working towards denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho waived U.S. sanctions over the lack of progress since then.
Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally destroy ourselves first of all, Mr Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "unfit", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Brett Kavanaugh "unreasonable" saying that he was unfit, due to the nature of his character, to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribeca Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman had behaved like that, I'm sure they would have called her a racist", Pelosi said in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional in denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both in their teens.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming and tearfully tearing at times when discussing his family and his time in high school.
He also specifically condemned the committee's Democrats, saying the allegations against him "destroyed his reputation in a coherent and disjointed manner" and that they were orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court because his evidence showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think it shows that it is irrelevant to those statements and the way Clinton supporters and Democrats have been protesting", he said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would seek confirmation, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court or the court he's on right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"Isn't it time to have someone who is unruly and prejudiced in court waiting for us to say, 'Is that great?'", Pelosi said.
And women have to talk about it.
A righteous speech, months and years of confidentiality accumulate, and cannot be removed without weeping.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who said she cries when she's upset, but she's developed a technique and so when she gets angry and starts crying, I'll tell the person who's talking to her, 'You think my purpose is sad because I'm crying.
I'm a year old.
And then I'll carry her on.
And I thought that was great.
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are, in essence, misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of my early job, in an office where men were the most numerous, and I cried with rage beyond words, is an older woman grabbing me by the knee - a cold-blooded controller who was always scaring me - and dragging me down the stairwell.
"Don't let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're a freak.
They will think you are sad and will be glad that they hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a train called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Ms. Schroeder, who was very frustrated, realized there was no reason she should not think about running for president herself.
"I didn't think about the decision properly", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates in the race already, and the last thing he needed was another.
Someone called us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,
Because she was late in the campaign, she was behind her in fundraising, so she promised not to participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a futile battle.
She noticed that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, her feelings became too much - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than representatives, and anger over gender bias - and she started to cry.
"You'd think my nerves were broken", Ms. Schroeder said of the press's response to her.
You'd think Kleenex was my physical patron.
I remember thinking, what would they put on my rock?
Did she cry?
How can the U.S.-China trade war be pro-Beijing
The first waves of the US-China trade war were enough to blind anyone, and while the battle is not over, a rift between the countries can be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase was introduced this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, taxing, for all intents and purposes, half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has paid back the price every time and, most recently, has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $600 billion of American goods.
China has promised to match the efforts of the US and the world's only largest economy is not likely to surrender soon.
Getting Washington to stop would mean yielding to the demands, but publicly criticizing the US would bring too much embarrassment to Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say if Beijing can move in the right direction, the U.S. trade war pressure could support China in a positive way in the longer term by making the two economies less dependent on each other.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for a sudden onset of economic panic in either country is, in fact, much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, a Asia-focused associate researcher at the Center for a New American Security, who is a co-author of the report.
Syria 'ready' to take back asylum seekers, says foreign minister
Syria says it is willing to take back asylum seekers voluntarily and is appealing for help to rebuild the country that has been ravaged by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions were improving in the country.
"The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is working hard to restore areas destroyed by terrorists to normalcy.
The conditions are now right for the admission back to the country of asylum seekers who have had to flee terrorism and the harmful economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help to rebuild the country.
But he insisted he would not accept aid with conditions or help from countries that had supported the rebels.
Europe wins the anxiety cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The USA have lost six times in a row on European soil, and have not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe managed to secure victory as Denmark's captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson had a tough tournament, but when the star of the USA's ball landed in the water on the par-3 16th hole he had to surrender the game to Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian golfer, had starred in every round, becoming one of only four players to win 5-0-0 since the tournament changed to its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5&4 by the best player on paper in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top choice, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Ian Poulter of England who was playing more likely in his final Ryder Cup.
Playing in his eighth Ryder Cup, Spain's Sergio Garcia became one of the most successful players in the tournament's history with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I'm not one to cry usually, but I can't help that today.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for putting his faith in me.
I'm so happy, so happy that we got the cup back.
The team is important, and I'm glad I was able to help", said Garcia through tears after Europe won.
He passed the baton to compatriot John Ram who beat USA golf champion Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles match on Sunday.
"I was so proud to beat Tiger Woods because I grew up watching him play golf", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France, meaning his current Ryder Cup record is 13-21-3.
And that's an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, having won 14 championships in his career, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had played so well throughout the tournament, Team USA had struggled all weekend to find a clear path.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of this team, they will fight hard.
We had put pressure on Europe during the morning.
We fought.
You must give credit to Thomas.
He's a captain without a second.
All 12 players played very well.
I want to work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I love our 12 players and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must raise a cap to them.
They played better than us".
