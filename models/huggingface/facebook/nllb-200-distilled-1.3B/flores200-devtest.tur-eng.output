This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils generally can't.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is pale or carotenoid in color at the base of the body and chestnut-brown at the top.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed stem called the bird's feather stem, but had other feather features, such as hooks and hooks, researchers concluded that the bird's feather stem was probably a later evolutionary development of these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes, but rather for temperature control and imaging purposes.
Although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, researchers claimed that it pointed to adult feathers, not a chick, for example.
A car bomb exploded at the police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty.

Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number associated with a star's plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is compared to its magnetic inversions.

The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Milky Way.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just like normal matter.
This theory states that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is arranged in a ring-like fashion around the galaxy and is made up of many small particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are left alone in a booth, leaving a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that shows the candidate they have chosen.
Once the authorities have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law regulates the procedure quite strictly.
The ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can confirm that there are no envelopes in the ballot boxes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes have been added to the boxes except those that are deemed proper and cast by approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close observation, following certain procedures.

The Royal Office, which is responsible for the prosecutions, has told reporters that no further comment will be made until at least the indictment is prepared.
The leaked document allegedly referred to a border dispute that Palestinians demanded be returned to the borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Other issues discussed include the future status of Jerusalem and the issue of the Jordan Valley, which are sacred to both nations.
Israel demands a 10-year military presence in the valley after the agreement is signed, while the Palestinians agree to limit the condition to five years.
While the trial was being observed and its effectiveness evaluated, it was planned that hunters participating in the complementary insecticide trial would be closely monitored by conservationists.
The team was joined by qualified volunteers from the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program, a joint effort between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW).
According to Park Conservation Deputy Director Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Heritage, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Interim Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of CEP to bring the country to new elections as part of a package of measures.
Martelly responded to high-attendance anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
The inability to hold the necessary elections has paved the way for sometimes violent protests, some of which have been expected since 2011.
In total, there were about 60 reported iPod overheating cases, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 new extreme warming events, and the company classified these events as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "really sad".
The earthquake occurred at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday) in the Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Bureau of Emergency Management said there were no reported injuries in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with an M16.
At least six people have been confirmed dead so far, while numerous hostages have been rescued.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released along with Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers replaced an old woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained in obstetrics and gynaecology and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins began studying preterm birth in her spare time while working at the hospital.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, the fetus's lungs would mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna, died one night when she was two months old, and she was just as unique, powerful woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels once said, "Luna was as weird as I am... maybe even stranger... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's term, Australia should have become a traitor republic.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the height of the poll, 31 percent believed Australia should never be a republic, while 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should be a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three flag races at the Commonwealth Games but his fitness has been questioned due to his complaints.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to relieve his pain because they were banned from competitions.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
In early February, many people confirmed this discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source of the water that makes the proteins and the organic matter that could support life.
Scientists hope to understand how comets formed long ago, when they collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing gay marriage.
He called the rumors "political babble and stupidity".
There's speculation that he'll be a presidential candidate in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA proposes will allow planes to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No extra travel, no overhead trains stopping at Wembley, no surface parking and no mill facilities.
Fearing a lack of transportation, the game was likely to be forced to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported that a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that species evolved in just two generations, although this was thought to have taken much longer because of the breeding between an endemic Darwin's spinous, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus spinous, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be put into any shape, rolled into any shape.
It can be woven into thin wire that can be bent, beaten or cut into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, so thin that it's sometimes used in books to decorate hand-painted pictures called "tezhip".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electrons because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron.
Mix two tablespoons of dry powder, then shape it into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers and it will give you a fun feeling and it will form a kind of shell in your hand.
Nearly every home in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drainage system.
In the Greek cities of Minos on Crete and Santorini, the remains of a sewage system were found in houses.
In ancient Egypt, Iran and China, toilets were also used, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of baths where women and men were in mixed company.
When you call someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a vehicle.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and because the Earth's atmosphere interferes with some of our light and vision, scientists use telescopes in space.
To put a satellite or telescope into space, you need a giant rocket more than 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is it has made transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
At the bottom of these are the more moderate cats, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat many small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Lion packs consist of about 30 females and one to three adult male relatives, with a young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a larger family of sisters and daughters.
Lion packs behave very similarly to wolf or dog packs, which are animals that behave surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (Genus Panthera).
The tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is much more like a rattling, howling phrase.
Ocelots love to eat small animals, they eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if they can, they catch birds.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find other animals by sensing and smelling where they are on the ground.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and they can also move extremely stealthily, and oseloids integrate with the environment of their prey to catch them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the population from which they came (for example, if they go behind a cliff or river, or to a new island where it will not be easy to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, which means that the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they start to look more and more different from the rest of the population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years later, these two animals will look too different to be the same species.
This process is called differentiation, which means the formation of new species, and differentiation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans emit (i.e., breathe).
Plants get their nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis, and they provide shade.
We make our homes from plants, we make our clothes from plants, we eat most of our food from plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mosazor was a predator in the prime of his era, so he was afraid of nothing but other Mosazor.
Its long jaws, with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, were filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, meaning there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe he had a fork tongue, and his diet included turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe he ate his own kind.
It also attacked anything that got into the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
While we are familiar with many of their foods, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a species of rodent called the nut-rat.
Another difference was that poor people and women liked to sit on chairs and eat their meals, while rich men liked to have banquets while they ate their meals and lay down.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in the following centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had tasted turkey.
The Babylonians had built a primary temple for each of their gods, the house of that god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner temple, which only the priests could enter.
Special pyramid-shaped towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
The Hebrew family spent most of their time outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open counters facing the street, stone used to build houses.
The land of Canaan lacked extensive forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has a sparse population, and in Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while travelling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', the people of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had many differences in their kings, customs and histories.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of the Declaration of Independence as a treasure map drawn on the back.
But that's not true, because even though there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed "4 July 1776 Original Declaration of Independence".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parchment manuscript (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for preservation.
So it's likely that the information is simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and subsequent wars liberated the north of France, but the south was still under occupation.
Vichy was ruled by the French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture shared by a substantially large group of people, a society, who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning 'civil', and is related to the Latin civis, meaning 'citizen', and civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and also describes the size of a society.
Civilization culture refers to the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural trace and its equitable distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving historical evidence of themselves and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first established a weak central government under the Confederate Constitution, and Congress was the only component of that government.
Congress had no taxing power, and because there was no national executive or judicial, it relied on often uncooperative state officials to enforce all its acts.
He didn't have the power to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The unanimous consent of all the states was required to change the articles, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were usually not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motorcycle racing are popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands, the largest being Honshu, making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to as a "group" geographically because of the island group it owns.
Taiwan's landmark dates back to a period in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company made a change in the methods of indigenous grain production by building a plant in southwestern Taiwan and employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Macchu Picchu consists of three main structures known as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the facility have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common form of still photography in the world is 35 mm, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, it takes its in-size ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
It's a little confusing that the 35mm is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer divided by twelve to find the ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS formats family) are equal to or very close to this in-length ratio.
The overused and often-dismissed rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism in a photograph while maintaining dimension.
It states that the most effective area for the main subject is the point of intersection of the lines that divide the image into three longitudinally and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was controlled.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had held European nations together despite differences in language and traditions.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is that wealth is used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and church funds are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and the concentration of power and wealth there had led many to question whether this principle was being followed.
Soon after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
Although this siege violated international law, which has been accepted as general law in many international treaties over the past two centuries, it was strategically effective and prevented the transportation of vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain posed a danger even to neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire ocean.
Because this tactic was given a limited response, Germany expected a response similar to that of the free submarine war.
In the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolation.
The nations that witnessed the horrors and persecutions of World War I wanted to avoid facing such a situation again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company, located in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry and a reference letter written by Charles Batchelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each period or ruling family in China was a separate dynasty.
There was also a period of instability, with each dynasty having its own regions, the most famous of which was the 60-year-long Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these times, fierce battles broke out between many nobles vying for the throne.
During one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, the Three Kingdoms Period, thousands of people died fighting to reach the highest position in the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, so that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same goes for the army because the ranking of the army is no longer based on class but on Cailaber.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working class members in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and he often went to a cave on the Mountain of Light, later called Hira, to immerse himself in the thoughts of the sages.
The cave itself, which dates from that time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it were known to exist, it's not easy to find.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the surrounding mountains, and little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramids built to honor the dead Pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the great pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The magnificent pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family.
The upper bow mark looks like a V-shape and the "lower bow mark" looks like a stapler or a square with no bottom.
It means you have to start at the top and push the bow, and you have to start at the bottom of the rod (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper bow usually produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more precise.
Feel free to make your own markings with a pencil, but remember that printed arrow marks are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
Terrified, King Louis XVI, his two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette and the King's sister Madame Elizabeth were forcibly removed from Versailles to Paris by a large group of women on 6 October 1789.
They returned to Paris in a car, surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the car windows.
At one point, a crowd shook the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the interest and most of the expenses of the bonds held on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the extra profit from years of exploitation of the Filipino people is among the major gains of US imperialism.
To understand the temple people, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the sect.
The era in which the events occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time period of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 CE).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the agreement ended.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very broad range of ideas in practice, but it literally includes views such as technological drivers or the inevitability of technology, which holds that the fate of human beings is determined by a logic associated with subconscious scientific laws and the use of these laws in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself develops a pathway that largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car necessarily pioneered the development of roads.
But having a nationwide road infrastructure is not economically viable if there are few vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to lower the cost of owning a vehicle.
Mass car ownership also causes more accidents on the roads, which leads to new techniques in the healthcare sector to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism passed down from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and in time, geography-related traditions and cultures developed that were more in keeping with where society was located and better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was seen as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It gained a reputation as a center of luxury around 400 C.E. and maintained that reputation until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined in the twelfth century as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more prized than those offered by Byzantine markets.
The title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris during these years.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of the slow communication channels, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to create its own style, and with the end of the Crusades, one of the greatest advances of the period was that people began to use buttons to button their clothes.
Sustainable agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses ecologically-specific protected seeds and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods to achieve maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers worked for a living, and this is still true in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture express that they are part of that culture, often using a distinct and symbolic style that includes fashion, attitudes, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to show the importance of socialization is to highlight several unfortunate cases involving children who were socialized by adults who neglected, unwillingly or knowingly abused them while growing up.
Some feral children were confined to enclosed areas by humans (often their own parents), and in some cases, abandonment was caused by the parents' denial that a child had a serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been subjected to serious child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, some are said to live alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits almost entirely similar behaviors to the animal that raised it (as far as physical limits allow), such as being afraid of humans or insensitive to humans.
Project-based learning goes a step further, making learning easy and engaging, while guidance support.
Referral support is not a learning method but an aid that provides support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The routing support can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher router, but so is the little attachment guy in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Scaffolds are built into the software and are intended to question, guide and explain procedures that the student may find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, nurturing, nurturing, but unfortunately, that's not the case.
We see the Protective Family System as a safe zone for these kids.
Our expectation from our foster care system is that it provides safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Child welfare is obliged to meet all the requirements that were not previously found in the home.
The Internet brings together elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add additional dimensions in terms of usability and satisfaction approach.
For example, learning and socialization are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to Internet sites, personal involvement and conducted relationships were also identified as new incentive factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998).
The use of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, facial movements that last for milliseconds.
It is suggested that the correct interpretation of microexpressions in particular can help determine whether a person is lying.
In his article entitled The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks noted that people who have trouble correctly perceiving speech due to brain damage can correctly assess intimacy despite this problem.
He even claims that animals, such as pet dogs, may have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research conducted in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation creates new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
In each generation, the separation and re-union between the two pools mixes the variation back and forth.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to humans would find it difficult to meet its amino acid requirements with available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, including growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest sources of plant protein to access would be proteins from leaves and legumes, but it's unlikely that plants could be digested without cooking by primates like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved "protein problems" in a similar way to chimpanzees on the savannah today.
Interrupted sleep is the process of consciously waking during normal sleep and falling back into sleep after a short time (about 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quieter bell clock to simply keep your consciousness clear without completely waking you up.
If you find yourself resetting the alarm in your sleep, you can place the clock on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep and forcing one to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the current life force, and each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can access enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the love of the Mahayana and many techniques derived from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of love that embraces everything.
Kundalini Yoga is a form of yoga that involves the awakening of Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States.
Although two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was to be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places for the next 40 years.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was for Romania to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead.
But these plans were thwarted almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army invaded and opened up the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to protect your country's ability to transport people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, when the Americans were trying to move troops and equipment across the Atlantic to deliver aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would most likely have taken over England as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are thought to have been first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to feed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and mail.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often driven by goat herders, usually children or teenagers, similar to the more commonly known shepherds.
Wagonways were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden rails, it allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the somewhat more dilapidated roads of the day.
Travers were used to hold tracks in place at a very early date, but it was discovered that they could be more efficient when the tracks were topped with an iron band.
This became common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron wagons.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were put into use.
The first known means of transport was walking, and people started walking upright with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means upright man, two million years ago.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not walk normally on two legs.
The first bipedal periods are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally consciously, we can join environmental movements, we can even become activists to help reduce the problems of the future.
This is like symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, then we need to find the root of the problem and neutralize it.
It is abundantly clear that the world has been greatly changed by man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems are being exacerbated by overpopulation and man's extravagant lifestyle.
After its approval in Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
150 to 200 copies of what are now known as the Dunlap broadsides were made in one night.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the garden of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 for reading to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The oldest copies of the document known to still exist are 25 Dunlap leaflets, of which no original manuscript version has survived.
Today, most paleontologists believe that there was a group of dinosaurs that survived and are alive today.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have plump feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the misuse of binary-valued encoded information.
A binary number can only have one of the values 0 and 1. These are called bits in computer technology.
The symptoms, like vomiting, are too common to diagnose right away.
The most important sign of indoor poisoning may be an open medicine can or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term insect is used officially by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarities to the bed bug, which is adapted to parasitise on humans.
Both Killer Beetles and Toads are nestlings adapted to live in their nests or homes.
There are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means that the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults is multiple sclerosis (MS).
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
Couples may decide that having children is not in their best interests or that it is not in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to adopt a plan for their baby.
During the adoption process, the adoptive parents terminate parental rights so that the child's family can be another couple.
The basic purpose of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method, which is actually the basis for most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. An experiment is a test used to ask questions, to exclude one or more possible hypotheses, and to guide scientific research by observation.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek learning declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely due to the existence of internal cycles and the production of these cycles by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that do not respond to external periodic cues alone have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain a period of free-flow even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterial implantation method.
They did two experiments, either tracing the DNA in radioactive phosphorus phage or radioactive sulfur portein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in the germline alone can affect children, while mutations in other regions can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting orangutans in Borneo, taking pictures and learning about them.
Every morning, people get into cars to go to work from small rural towns, passing other workers who are just leaving to go to work.
In these dynamic intermodal journeys, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this massive carbon economy is disrupting the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of this magnitude, like water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there a more fundamental problem?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to work on traffic flow because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100 percent accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably stable range; thus, traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, whose ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies, to find food and mates with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their bodies.
This gives them a wider and smaller range of places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect species that cannot fold their wings back are the jellyfish and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people, on the contrary, believed that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of the second largest river.
At six miles wide, the Amazon is also the widest river on earth.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramid lasted until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in terms of size and technical perfection.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the monuments left by their predecessors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most of the state's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since they can be discovered in nature in their original forms and extracted relatively simply with primitive tools, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since the earliest times.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they transform into new substances to take the forms we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of amethylic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and every matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
In short, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods emerged, the pen's use and frequency declined.
People are now texting from computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
When something new comes out, who knows what will happen to the use of the keyboard?
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like lifting a cart up a hill, and the core is reused and then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can be broken down with little or no intervention.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under Maria, thicker in the mountains.
Because the crust is thinner, there could be more maria on the side, so it was easier for the lava to surface.
Content theories are about finding things that trigger or attract people.
These theses show that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories are concerned with what causes some people to desire the things they do and what causes things around them to make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can occur as executives begin to refer and manage former colleagues. One aspect of Yelpazen is trying to stay in the form of "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These types of leaders have difficulty making decisions that are not popular, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who thinks that everything the team does should be done by him.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes conflict between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their close physical groups.
Because they can meet at changing time zones that may not be understood by their local governments, virtual teams generally have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member reports to the invisible team, which sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of customers.
To be innovative, an organization needs to foster leadership, knowledge sharing and training within the company, as well as create a culture of innovation.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuity approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the scope and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies also allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material support to design simulation models that help us unravel the workings of our minds.
While AI has a strong resemblance to science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves developing robots that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, answering customer diagnoses and questions, handwriting, voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become a separate discipline focused on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems, such as those found in home computers and video game software, are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
School trips are an important part of all classes, and teachers often love to take their students to places where bus travel is not possible.
Technology provides the solution by offering a virtual tour where students can explore the museum's structures, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Sharing a school trip in a virtual environment is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trips to the State Capitol each year, with the website re-arranged each year, but older versions are kept online to be used as a notebook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, which is often changed by the presence of a readership as students begin their blogging experiences with sloppy grammar and spelling mistakes.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "puts students in a position to become more aware of the world around them".
Blogging is a tool that opens the door to collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school curriculum.
The appropriate use of blogs "can enable students to be more analytical and critical; students can actively react to Internet material to determine their position in the context of others' posts and their own viewpoints on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, Ottawa, is home to many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka and beyond, home to untouched natural beauty.
All of this and more underscores the fact that Ontario is often referred to by foreigners as a distinctly Canadian province.
The vast areas to the north are sparsely populated and some consist of almost deserted wilderness.
To make a comparison that will surprise most people, there are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is the largest of the outlying islands and is a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or dependent on France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it became widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape Route by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, which led from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Every female traveler is advised to say that they are married, regardless of their actual civilization.
Wearing a ring (not a very expensive one) may also be helpful .
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in what they would call harassment and that it is not unusual to be followed, held, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that's not the right thing to do!).
The foundations of the modern city of Casablanca were laid by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenidians as a strategic port, under the name of Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading centers in the city.
If you want to shop in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as crowns, pots, leather goods, pitchers and various Ivory items, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered many of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
Even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city, which has some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa, is also a base for those who want to climb Nyiragongo volcano.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it is a tourist destination with an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' most important stops during his special on PBS's Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, with more Arab air than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's most attractive spots, it is also seen as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance fees and entrance fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which gives access to various parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the Hong Kong area and is a place that many visitors consider to be their main focal point.
The buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline are like a glittering column chart, made more prominent by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the opposite Kowloon coast.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been acquired from extensively reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers took for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial history of the region, this is a good place to start.
Stretching some 50 miles [80 km] from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt.
The remaining part of the forest within the Indian borders is called Sundarban National Park.
But forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include the last remnants of the vast forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2 with about a third of it in wetland/marshland areas.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and currently the area is thought to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-regional bus stop (across the river) during the day, but mostly, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-regional buses are often full, it is advisable to book a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese minivans, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable means of getting to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with two lanes 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá and other indigenous tribes, who subsisted on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Giant Territory of the Indians", was formed as a result of encounters with indigenous communities by Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its indigenous identity and character to a large extent since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For information on where to buy tickets to tournaments and polo matches, see Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is set to the value of one British pound (GBP).
You know how to change currency at the only bank in the islands, in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally circulated throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also generally accepted.
Credit cards are probably not accepted on remote islands, but Sterling and US Dollars may be used.
It's almost impossible to change Falkland pound outside the islands, so change your currency before you leave here.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, winter is summer in the northern hemisphere and summer is winter in the northern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical climate zone, with temperatures above 30°C common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes you feel colder than the thermometer would suggest.
There are no distinct seasons that can be described as rainy and "dry".
Although most of the animals in the park are familiar to humans, the wildlife is still wild and the animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you're supposed to stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they may seem, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that the smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid keeping or cooking smelly food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, on the island of Upolu, with a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port, thus giving the port its unfortunate reputation.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful meeting in the town, organized by the Mau movement, resulted in the assassination of Supreme Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Due to Auckland's location in the middle of two harbours, there are many beaches.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that can be swum safely, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa tree.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the area between Waitemata Harbour, the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a variety of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not a very complex beer but is nice and refreshing.
Although there's plenty of French wine to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines may do better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid of it, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'straight white' coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black espresso, cappuccino comes topped with high cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, juices are expensive, but delicious.
The reef is subject to many trips throughout the year, and for these reasons, reef injuries are very rare.
However, consult the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish emerges north of 1770 from October to April near the coasts and near river outfalls.
Sharks are found, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean permanently, their primary habitat being the river beds north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers feel comfortable, knowing that they have a place to sleep when they arrive.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also choose other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to get other necessary documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they can hold your reservation for you.
Any changes or requests should be communicated to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on the festival grounds, and most attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you must go ahead to take a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even if the main stages are out of music, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in the winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because crossing the ice can make a terrible noise for the sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time spent in the city.
Casinos often go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend, often with no windows or clocks, and it may not be easy to find exits.
Food, drink, and entertainment are often provided to keep guests in a good mood and to please them.
Some venues may serve alcoholic beverages, but being drunk adversely affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes must consider the possibility of snow, ice, or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is very low, and you cannot drive as if you were on dry asphalt.
In a blizzard, it can snow quickly enough to keep you stuck in the snow.
Vision may also be limited by snowfall, type, condensation in the windshields or icing.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is often used to refer to trips made to watch the striking African wildlife that live in the savannahs.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars so standard equipment gives them a better view.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Walking safaris (also called "nature walks", "nature walking safaris", or "walks") are walks of a few hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the 1964 games, will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you've booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies change, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies will not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to be priced between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Most hotels have an iron and an ironing table that can be borrowed even if it's not in the room.
If you don't have a hair dryer or don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause it to pull or even burn in extreme cases).
There are different ways to treat water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes for water to boil.
If you're concerned about this, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a well-known brand.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to their region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or spread infection.
Dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with infectious diseases or force are not usually covered by the pest.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save significantly, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The terrain between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, which often passes through remote, backward areas.
If you're not used to driving in the countryside, beware of steep slopes, narrow lanes and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent episodes  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is more important than the opposite.
Strangely, the cell phone signal here is stronger than other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria it is as rich and varied as its southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit pastry with apples baked in the pastries throughout the year and cherries and pears that show up in the summer is common.
Many German pastries also include almonds, nuts and other tree fruits.
If you want small but rich pastries, try what you might call Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on where you are in the region.
Curry is a dish that includes meat or vegetables as well as dried herbs and spices.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used predominantly in curries; coconut milk is widely used in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent.
When referring to Indonesia, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term is used for foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Cava.
The main spices important to cava are peanuts, bitter peppers, sugar (especially cava coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is the support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can cause safety problems because of the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck in them.
If a rider gets his foot caught in a sling while falling off a horse and the horse runs away, the rider may be dragged off.
First of all, most riders wear very narrow-soled riding boots with high heels and smooth.
Some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the upside down skin to fall off the saddle when a falling rider pulls back.
Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as South America's Yosemite, with its high granite walls and steep cliffs.
The summits offer spectacular views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes in the endless possibilities of climbing.
Slope-snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skis or snowboards that are attached to your feet and that are used to ski down on snow-covered terrain.
Skiing, also called "skiing muppets", is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts who plan their entire vacation to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first purpose-built ski club was opened in Australia by the Norwegians.
Skiing and backpacking: This activity is also called skiing, ski touring or ski walking in the countryside.
It is similar to, but generally slightly different from, alpine-style ski touring or mountaineering, which are done on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a walking trail.
If the conditions are right, you'll be able to cover much more distance than you would walk, but you rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without well-maintained trails and a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, visiting more than one country means going through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, in this sense, functions more or less as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control points again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
The definition of antiquity varies by geography, as the age limit can be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be classified as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is important for many people in other professions.
Although traditional, not all Sami people made a living from large-scale reindeer herding, but from fishing, hunting, or similar occupations.
Today, many Lapps work in modern occupations.
Although it is commonly used, especially among non-Romani, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult advice from governments outside your own government, but their advice is directed at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The recommendations are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas put forward are often superficial, general and oversimplified, as opposed to more detailed information elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a general term for dangerous weather conditions that can cause damage, serious social harm or loss of life.
Extreme weather can be seen all over the earth and has different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.

Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents with them on the way back.
Each government is different in its willingness to issue passport with an unmarked gender (X) or renewed documents to match the desired name and gender.
The interest shown by foreign governments in these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoints have become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender individuals should not expect to pass the screens before surgery without compromising their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are frequently the flow of waves that break up on a reef or similarly back up onto the beach.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in a few deep sections, where a rapid flow towards the deep water can occur.
Most deaths are the result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible, due to fatigue.
Once out of the water, the difficulty of swimming back is no different than normal.
Try to aim where you won't get caught again, or depending on your skills or whether you're noticed or not, you might prefer to wait for help.

When you return home from abroad, you may have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first go abroad, people are likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate the need to be patient and understanding with returning travelers.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them silently before the show starts.

Scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Various countries have claimed the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and the islands, with a total of sixteen active bases in 2020, are the place with the most bases.
It is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island, where Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano has created a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is in the southern part of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula Mountains here merge with the plateau, then rise back to the surface to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Range, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, includes the Vinson Massif, the highest mountain in Antarctica, with its summit at 4,892 m (15,050 ft).
In remote areas where cell phones are not in range, satellite phones may be your only option.
Since you need to be outdoors to see the satellite clearly to make a phone call, a satellite phone is often not a replacement for a cell phone.
This service is frequently used by cruise ships and cargo ships, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.

Finland is a great place for boat trips, and there are thousands of islands in the "land of a thousand lakes", mostly in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
Not unless you have a yacht in the dunes and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagoes and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a boat offer a different experience.
Boating is a traditional activity in Finland, where one boat crashes for every seven or eight people.
This is the same as Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's quite unique, except in the Netherlands, for example, the number is 41.
Most of the original Baltic cruises included long-term stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can sleep back on the ship at night and explore the historic city for a few full days.
From 2009, if you only go ashore by boat, you will also not need a visa.
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not near the sea at all and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially for those who have never flown before or have experienced a flying trauma.

If the items were shipped by air freight, some routes may have taken days to clear and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger.
The obvious way to fly first class is to knock off a big pile of cash for privilege (or, better yet, have your company do it for you).
But it's not economical, because with a rough calculation, you can pay up to four times the normal fare for business class and up to 11 times the normal fare for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to ask for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines recognize that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinev. The country's native language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been greatly affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political talks, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova were reestablished.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Izmir is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center built around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.

Many more common species can be found here, as well as rare fauna such as the European lynx, wolf, eagle, owl, vulture, wildcat, and bushy wren.
When visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders are covered.
Most monasteries offer a cloak for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own cloak, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
